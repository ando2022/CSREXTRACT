highlights
Hartmann delivered on the expectations for 2014, lifting both revenue and profit margin. The development was driven by increased sales of retail packaging across Hartmann's markets and by a positive effect of the capacity expansion in North America. Based on good results in 2014, expansion in North America and acquisition of South American activities in early 2015, we are launching the strategy `Unpacking our potential' along with new financial targets for 2017.
CEO Ulrik Kolding Hartvig says:"2014 was a good year for Hartmann with increased sales of retail packaging and good results in both Europe and North America. Q4 turned out to be both historically strong and a milestone in Hartmann's development, with the expansion of production capacity in North America taking effect and the acquisition of South America's leading manufacturer of moulded-fibre packaging, effective from the start of 2015." "Based on our expansion in the Americas, we are launching `Unpacking our potential', Hartmann's new strategy for enhancing our efficiency and accelerating growth in the years ahead. In 2015, we expect revenue of DKK 2.0-2.1 billion and a profit margin of 10-11.5%. By the end of 2017, we intend to further lift revenue to DKK 2.2-2.4 billion and the profit margin to 12-14%."
Q4 2014
· T otal revenue came to DKK 478 million (2013: DKK 410 million), with operating profit*up at DKK 75 million (2013: DKK 44 million), corresponding to a profit margin* of 15.8% (2013: 10.8%).

· In North America, revenue grew to DKK 100 million (2013: DKK 73 million) and operating profit to DKK 25 million (2013: DKK 14 million), corresponding to a profit margin of 25.2% (2013: 18.9%). The progress is attributable to increased sales and a higher proportion of premium products, just as the currency development contributed favourably.

accelerating growth

Over the last years, our strategy `Competitive edge ­ driving growth ` has set the course for Hartmann's development, and step by step we have built a stronger and more stable business with improved results. The progress has been driven by a positive momentum across our business areas and a consistent focus on strengthening our competitiveness.

The potential is already there in the form of our market positions, product portfolio, production network and technological capabilities. In the coming years, to put it briefly, we will continue to further improve what we are already doing well ­ and add to that by accelerating organic growth and assessing whichever possibilities for attractive acquisitions that may arise.

2014 was a landmark year for Hartmann. We commissioned our new production capacity in North America and laid the foundation for expanding into the attractive markets in Brazil and Argentina with the acquisition of Sanovo Greenpack ­ South America's leading manufacturer of moulded-fibre packaging. On the basis of our performance in recent years, historically strong results in Q4 and the expansion of our business, we now continue the journey in 2015-2017 under the heading `Unpacking our potential ` with a keen focus on enhancing efficiency and speeding up growth.

We will leverage our strengths so we can continue to create value for our shareholders and deliver on our new 2017 targets with revenue of DKK 2.2-2.4 billion and a profit margin of 12-14%. We maintain our dividend policy as well as our requirements for operations and new investments to ensure our shareholders a continued attractive return on the invested capital of at least 22% at the end of 2017.

Our ambition is for Hartmann to become a global market leader within egg packaging, a leading producer of fruit packaging in selected markets and the preferred supplier of related technology.

2014 in review

Developments in Q4 2014
In Q4, revenue was DKK 478 million (2013: DKK 410 million) of which the European business contributed DKK 377 million (2013: DKK 337 million). In North America, revenue was DKK 100 million (2013: DKK 73 million).

Other revenue for Europe grew to DKK 121 million (2013: DKK 115 million) reflecting a positive development in Hartmann Technology.

Operating profit grew to DKK 75 million (2013: DKK 44 million), corresponding to a profit margin of 15.8% (2013: 10.8%). Operating profit in our European business grew to DKK 57 million (2013: DKK 37 million) with the profit margin at 15.1% (2013: 10.8 %). In North America, operating profit grew to DKK 25 million (2013: DKK 14 million) with the profit margin at 25.2% (2013: 18.9%).

North America In North America, revenue grew to DKK 319 million (2013: DKK 292 million) driven by a higher proportion of premium products, general progress in sales and the positive effect of the production capacity expansion. The growth in North America was realised in a market of intensified competition.

Cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 49 million (2013: net inflow of DKK 34 million), while cash flows from investing activities were a net outflow of DKK 24 million (2013: net outflow of DKK 51 million). Cash flows from financing activities were a net outflow of DKK 13 million (2013: net outflow of DKK 42 million).

Operating profit Hartmann lifted operating profit for 2014 to DKK 163 million (2013: DKK 148 million), corresponding to a profit margin of 10.1%, meeting our guidance of a profit margin of 9.0-10.5%. The progress was driven by the positive development in the European business.

comprehensive income 2014
Revenue Total revenue grew to DKK 1,615 million (2013: DKK 1,579 million) meeting our guidance of DKK 1.6-1.7 billion in revenue for 2014. The increase was driven by progress in both Europe and North America.
Europe Revenue in our European business grew to DKK 1,296 million (2013: DKK 1,287 million). The development was driven by progress in sales of retail packaging to existing and new customers and a higher average

Europe In Europe, operating profit grew to DKK 128 million (2013: DKK 109 million) and the profit margin to 9.9% (2013: 8.5%). The higher share of retail packaging offset the impact of increased competition on the European markets and contributed to lifting operating profit. The progress was also driven by lower energy prices and implented energy efficiencies.
North America In North America, operating profit came to DKK 60 million (2013: DKK 63 million), corresponding to a profit margin of 18.7% (2013:

Hartmann met expectations for 2014 with revenue of DKK 1.6 billion and a profit margin of 10.1%.

21.6%). The expansion of the production capacity impacted on efficiency and entailed extra costs of a temporary nature, which to a very high extent were offset by higher sales and the increased share of premium products.

Comprehensive income Comprehensive income grew to DKK 117 million (2013: DKK 77 million) and was favourably affected by the increase in profit for the year and adversely affected by actuarial losses on pension obligations.

Corporate functions Costs related to corporate functions came to DKK 25 million for 2014 (2013: DKK 24 million).
Special items Special items relating to the purchase of Sanovo Greenpack were a net expense of DKK 7 million for 2014 (2013: net expense of DKK 39 million), see note 11 to the financial statements.
Financial income and expenses As a result of adverse exchange rate adjustments, financial income and expenses grew to a net expense of DKK 17 million for 2014 (2013: net expense of DKK 15 million.)
Profit for the year Profit before tax for 2014 increased to DKK 139 million (2013: 95 million). Tax on profit for the year amounted to an expense of DKK 20 million (2013: an expense of DKK 9 million), corresponding to an effective tax rate of 15% (2013: 10%), see note 13 to the financial statements. Tax for the year was favourably impacted by an expected higher rate of utilisation of tax-loss carry forwards in North America.

Investments and cash flows At 31 December 2014, tangible and intangible assets came to DKK 571 million (2013: 547 DKK million). Investments came to DKK 99 million (2013: 115 million), while depreciation and amortisation fell to DKK 71 million (2013: DKK 77 million).
Total cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 141 million in 2014 (2013: net inflow of DKK 178 million), and the development may be attributed to a higher amount of capital being tied in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales in Q4 2014.
Cash flows from investing activities were a net outflow of DKK 98 million (2013: net outflow of DKK 112 million). Total cash flows from operating and investing activities came to a net inflow of DKK 43 million (2013: net inflow of DKK 66 million).
Cash flows from financing activities were a net outflow of DKK 33 million (2013: net outflow of DKK 86 million).
At 31 December 2014, the interest-bearing debt stood at DKK 161 million (2013: DKK 138 million).

Profit for the year after tax grew to DKK 119 million (2013: 86 million). Financial resources were satisfactory, standing at DKK 411 million at year-end 2014.

Statement of comprehensive income | Statement of cash flows | Balance sheet | Statement of changes in equity | Notes
Earnings per share grew 39%, and the Board of Directors proposes dividends of DKK 9.50 per share.

BALANCE sheet
Total assets at 31 December 2014 were DKK 1,244 million (2013: 1,126 million).
ROIC Return on invested capital in 2014 was 22.3% against 23.0% in 2013.
Equity At 31 December 2014, Hartmann's equity was DKK 663 million (2013: DKK 612 million) with an equity ratio of 53% (2013: 54%) and a gearing of 24% (2013: 23%).
Earnings per share for 2014 grew to DKK 17.2 (2013: DKK 12.4). At the annual general meeting to be held on 8 April 2015, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend payout of DKK 9.50 per share (2013: DKK 9.50), equivalent to a payout ratio of 56% (2013: 78%). The proposed dividend payout is based on the cash requirements relating to the completed purchase of the South American activities and on sustaining Hartmann's strategy

parent company 2014
The parent company reported revenue of DKK 1,250 million (2013: 1,251 million), and operating profit of DKK 47 million (2013: DKK 35 million).
Profit for the year was DKK 140 million (2013: DKK 194 million). The development was favourably affected by the increase in operating profit. Lower dividend payments from subsidiaries and a decline in reversal of previous years' impairment of investments in subsidiaries had an adverse effect.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 6 January 2015, Hartmann completed the purchase of the South American moulded-fibre activities ("Sanovo Greenpack") of Lactosan Sanovo Holding A/S as described in company announcement 11/2014 dated 1 December 2014.

outlook

Based on the strategy ` Unpacking our potential', Hartmann will further enhance efficiency and accelerate growth in the years 2015-2017.
Outlook for 2015 In 2015, we expect to lift revenue to DKK 2.0-2.1 billion and the profit margin to 10-11.5% in consequence of the addition of the SouthAmerican activities along with improved capacity utilisation in Europe and North America.
Targets for 2017 Up to the end of 2017, efficiency improvements and organic growth through improved capacity utilisation and extension of the production network will ensure growth in sales to DKK 2.2-2.4 billion and a profit margin of 12-14%.
The underlying objective for Hartmann's operations and investments is to ensure our shareholders a continued attractive return on invested capital (ROIC) of at least 22% by the end of 2017.
The effect of potential acquisitions is not included in the targets, and the results will also depend on external factors such as fluctuations in commodity prices and exchange rates.

Assumptions Hartmann's revenue and profit margin guidance for 2015 reflects the acquisition of the South American activities as of January 2015. In addition, the combined costs of raw materials and the selling prices are assumed to remain relatively stable at the level prevailing at the date of release of this annual report. Deviations from these assumption may affect the 2015 performance.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, operating profit is generally higher for the first and fourth quarters than for the second and third quarters. The profit margin is mainly exposed to developments in raw material prices and exchange rates. We have hedged our primary currency exposure for the first nine months of 2015.
Forward-looking statements The forward-looking statements in this annual report reflect Hartmann's current expectations for future events and financial results. The statements are inherently subject to uncertainty, and actual results may therefore differ from expectations. Factors which may cause the actual results to deviate from expectations include, but are not limited to, general economic developments and developments in the financial markets, changes or amendments to legislation and regulation in our markets, changes in demand for products, competition and the prices of raw materials. See also the section on risk factors and note 34 to the financial statements.

StrategY 2015-2017

Hartmann's core competence is the production of moulded-fibre packaging, which along with our strong market positions in existing markets forms the basis of our ambition to become a global market leader within moulded-fibre egg packaging, a leading manufacturer of fruit packaging in selected markets and the preferred supplier of related technology.

With the strategy `Competitive edge ­ driving growth' in 2011-2014, we have built a solid and competitive business with a considerable potential. Up to the end of 2017, we will continue those efforts and unfold Hartmann's potential under the heading `Unpacking our potential'.
Through the two key focus areas growth and efficiency, we will lift revenue to DKK 2.2-2.4 billion and the profit margin to 12-14% in 2017 by:

UNPACKING OUR POTENTIAL
Leveraging and expanding our strong positions in existing markets and assessing the possibilities for global growth through expansion of the production network and potential acquisitions of attractive businesses.

Applying and developing our proven techno logical competencies to fuel production optimisation, machine sales and new partnership agreements.

Tailoring our versatile product portfolio to the specific demand patterns in existing markets and increasing sales of transport packaging as well as standard and premium products.

Optimising and expanding our well-established production platform and generating a more efficient and flexible production.

EUROPe
In Europe, our focus on ensuring the optimal utilisation of our existing production capacity continues through adapting and developing both product portfolio and production equipment.

We will also continuously optimise the production network and maintain focus on reducing production and overhead costs in Europe in order to lift profitability.

These efforts aim to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of our European factories and provide the basis for sales growth of both transport and retail packaging.

north america and south America
Development of our American activities will contribute significantly to Hartmann's growth in the period ahead.
The completed expansion of production capacity in North America is to be fully leveraged, and during the strategy period we will consider opportunities for further expansion in the North American market with a view to continued sales growth.
With the completed purchase in January 2015 of Sanovo Greenpack, Hartmann holds a strong presence with four production facilities on the Brazilian and Argentinian markets for moulded-fibre egg and fruit packaging. During the strategy period, we will invest in expanding the capacity in South America. This will provide the foundation for accommodating the growing demand in these markets, which are characterised by favourable demographic trends and rising urbanisation. Further to that, we will continue our focus on integrating the South American business in the group to ensure we leverage our combined competencies and knowledge across our business areas in order to continously improve efficiency.

Hartmann Technology
The technological competencies in Hartmann Technology are the common ground for Hartmann's business areas, which with their diverse product portfolios and business models serve a variety of markets.
Hartmann Technology will continue to sell technology and services outside of Hartmann's main markets. In this respect, we will assess where relevant the possibility of entering partnerships or acquiring minority holdings in companies which Hartmann Technology supplies. In this way, we can gain access to attractive new markets and lift Hartmann's earnings.

Strong organisation
Hartmann has established a strong organisation with five business areas ­ Europe, Hartmann Technology, Israel, North America and South America ­ all supported by the corporate functions Finance, HR, Engineering and Operations & Process Development.

We operate in regions with highly varying market conditions, and therefore the decision-making competence is highly decentralised to the day-to-day management of each business area reporting directly to the Executive Board. The Executive Board has the overall responsibility for strengthening Hartmann's operations and developing the business within the framework of the strategy `Unpacking our potential'.

MARKEts and PRODUcTs

As a manufacturer of moulded-fibre packaging Hartmann operates in several diverse markets with varying product offerings that are continuously adapted to regional needs. With the addition of the South American activities in January 2015, Hartmann's aggregate product portfolio now comprises retail packaging for eggs and transport packaging for eggs and fruit.

"With our capacity expansion in North America and the addition of the South American activities, Hartmann is strongly positioned in attractive growth markets."

Retail packaging for eggs continues to be our main product category. The segmentation into standard and premium products varies on each market depending on matters such as the maturity of the retail trade, the penetration of moulded-fibre packaging and consumers' focus on sustainability.
For sales of egg and fruit packaging, our main markets are Europe, North America and South America, while Hartmann Technology sells its machinery, technology and services relating to moulded-fibre manufacturing globally ­ and mostly outside of Hartmann's markets.
The demand for egg and fruit packaging is generally quite stable and not particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. However, the demand is to some extent subject to seasonality. Hartmann's primary markets are highly competitive and dominated by a few large and medium-sized players.
Over the years, Hartmann has developed and launched new product lines, which have been standard-setters for quality packaging. The development of innovative products strengthens Hartmann's position as the customers' preferred supplier and entails a number of advantages within manufacturing and transportation. In that respect, we have taken out patents in order to actively protect our rights to production methods, trademarks, etc.
"We keep improving our operations in Europe to ensure the necessary capacity to grow sales of both transport and retail packaging."
Europe With a market share of about 40%, Hartmann is the leading manufacturer of egg packaging in the relatively mature and well consolidated European markets with growth rates expected to be at the level of 3%

in the coming strategy period. Market growth in Europe varies across borders but is generally driven by a growing demand for retail packaging. This is the result of continued progress and professionalisation of the retail trade along with the ongoing conversion from plastic to moulded-fibre packaging.
North America In North America, our moulded-fibre products represent some 15% of the total market for egg packaging in moulded fibre, plastic and foam. Market growth in North America is expected to be around 3%, driven by conversion to moulded-fibre packaging and rising egg consumption.
Customers increasingly want products in the premium segment where we have a strong market position. In 2014, we added a new and ground-breaking product to this segment ­ `The Hybrid' ­ combining a bottom of protective moulded fibre with a top of folding carton, providing excellent marketing opportunities. The new product is sold to a number of customers and in November received the `Package of the year 2014' award from the Paperboard Packaging Council in North America
South America Hartmann is market leader in Brazil and Argentina where we sell both egg and fruit packaging, covering about one third of the demand for egg packaging. Hartmann's market share of fruit packaging is about one fifth in Brazil and about half in Argentina. Aggregate market growth in South America is expected to be at the level of 4-7% driven by growing demand, favourable demographic trends and the continual urbanisation.
In the coming years we will accommodate the demand by expanding the production network to allow Hartmann to continue and accelerate growth in South America.

RISK Factors

Hartmann is exposed to operating risks, which we monitor and actively consider on an ongoing basis. The Executive Board is responsible for identifying and managing risks in compliance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. Together with the audit committee, the Executive Board reviews the risks that may affect Hartmann's operational and financial targets. The purpose of risk management is to identify the various risk areas, determine how to manage these risks and ensure an optimal balance between risk and return.

Reliance on suppliers We contract with a number of suppliers of recycled paper, energy and other raw materials used in the production. If contracts with one or more of these suppliers are terminated or breached, or the suppliers fail to meet their contractual obligations for other reasons, we may not be able to source the necessary raw materials, or we may be compelled to make purchases from alternative suppliers and not necessarily on the same terms.

commercial risks
Reliance on customers Hartmann's customer portfolio is well-diversified and consists of several large customers as well as many small customers. Our customer portfolio is expected to be developing toward fewer and larger customers, and we expect to become more reliant on this customer group in future.
Demand for eggs and fruit Our core business consists of sales of egg and fruit packaging, which are sensitive to the demand for eggs and fruit. The consumption of eggs and fruit can be influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control, including consumers` health perceptions, regional export and trade conditions, fear of potential health effects posed by diseases among laying hens, etc. The consumption of, and hence the demand for, Hartmann's products is driven by demographic trends and has historically been resilient to slowdowns in economic growth.
"Hartmann employs a structured approach to optimisation and certification of the production in accordance with international standards for businesses operating in the food industry."

Hartmann has contracted with several different suppliers of recycled paper, energy and other raw materials.
Fluctuations in raw material prices Hartmann is dependent on the purchase prices of the raw materials used in the production. In particular, the company is exposed to fluctuations in the purchase price of recycled paper and energy (electricity and gas), which are the most important raw materials in the production.
There is limited scope for reducing sensitivity to developments in the price of recycled paper if supplies of the required volumes are to be secured and maintained. We substitute to some extent certain types of paper for other types if prices are more favourable.
Hartmann regularly signs fixed-price agreements with energy suppliers for typically 6 or 12 months, covering a substantial part of our energy consumption. However, it is not possible to sign fixed-price agreements with energy suppliers in all the countries in which we operate.
We are committed to reducing our sensitivity to fluctuations in raw material prices through continuous implementation of technological improvements and optimisation of work processes.
Power plant In 2008, district heating company Tønder Fjernvarme filed a complaint with the the Secretariat of the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority concerning the pricing of surplus heat from Hartmann's power plant in Tønder, Denmark, cf. note 3 to the financial statements. Once a decision has been made, management will assess whether to bring the case before the Danish Energy Board of Appeal.

"The management models STEP® Environment and STEP® Human help reduce the environmental and social risks."

environmental and social risks
Environmental risks Hartmann's activities, including production, sale, use, storage and disposal of products, are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations. Environmental risks are monitored both locally and from the head office. Our environment management model, STEP® Environment, is an effective and professional tool that helps prevent, remedy or minimise any adverse effect on the external environment. We use and expect to continue to use considerable resources to observe and comply with environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.
Hartmann is subject to rules governing noise reductions, waste water treatment and waste disposal as well as the EU CO2 trading system. Our policy is to operate all production facilities in an environmentally responsible manner and in compliance with our sustainability principles and environment management model. A number of Hartmann's production facilities are ISO 14001-certified.

insurance
Hartmann has a comprehensive insurance programme which reflects the scope and extent of the operations and their geographical location. The insurance programme is reviewed annually by an insurance broker, and adjustments are made on an ongoing basis to support the development of the business.
The single most significant risk is the total loss of a factory from fire since the re-establishment of production facilities would be very time consuming and involve the risk of business interruption and loss of market share. Consequently, Hartmann has taken out an all risk insurance policy for all production facilities, which covers fire damage, consequential loss and other incidents. In addition, we work systematically to prevent injury and damage, and a Risk Management programme has been set up with the help of an insurance broker. Hartmann's insurance programme includes commercial and product liability, property and contents, consequential loss, work-related accidents, personal injury, and environmental liability.

For more information about sustainable development, see `Corporate social responsibility' or visit csr2014.hartmann-packaging.com.
Corporate social relations and risks We give high priority to measures safeguarding health and safety at the workplace, protecting human values in society at large as well as the people who are in contact with Hartmann or with Hartmann's products. Our management model STEP® Human ensures compliance with our standards for health and safety at the workplace. The model also ensures that we handle our corporate social responsibility in an effective and efficient manner and act as a responsible player in the countries in which we operate.

Financial risks
Our financial results and equity are influenced by a number of financial risks, including interest rate, foreign exchange, liquidity and credit risks.
The management of financial risks is concentrated in our corporate finance function, which also acts as a service centre for all subsidiaries.
Forward contracts are used for hedging some of the financial risks that may arise out of commercial activities. Hartmann does not engage in speculative transactions.
Financial risks and financial risk management are described in detail in note 34 to the financial statements.

corporate social responsibility

Our activities and achievements within corporate social responsibility are described in our Global Compact progress report for 2014, which in compliance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act is available at csr2014.hartmann-packaging.com. The information in this report is a presentation of our key activities in 2014.
Our corporate social responsibility activities form an integral part of our business model with sustainability as a competitive advantage and an essential parameter in the marketing of our products. Consumers and retail chains in the mature markets continue to demand more and more of the sustainability of packaging, and Hartmann strengthened its profile in this area also in 2014.
Certification of the production network We are continuously working to streamline and quality assure the production, and by certifying the processes at the factories, we achieve both improvements and marketing of our competencies.
The requirements for food safety in connection with the manufacture of packaging is increasing, and in 2014 the food safety system on Hartmann's Croatian factory was certified according to the internationally recognised ISO 22000 standard. The certification evidences the ability to effectively and safely identify, assess and manage hygiene risks in the production, and the implementation of the standard has led to several positive changes in processes, routines and behaviour.
Anti-corruption programme completed In 2011,Hartmann launched an anti-corruption policy,focussing on providing information about the efforts to combat corruption and bribery. These efforts have included courses and training programmes for relevant managers and employees, and the enforcement of the principles under the policy has at least in one case resulted in the termination of a supplier. In 2014, the anti-corruption programme was completed when the last of the selected managers and employees did the training

and committed to complying with the policy. Where relevant, new employees will receive the necessary training and subsequently commit to non-violation of the anti-corruption policy.
Efficiencies reduce emissions We continue to focus on reducing CO2 equivalent emissions, and in 2014, we planned and implemented a number of efficiencies in the production, including a new drying tool.
We have reduced the CO2 equivalent emissions per kilogram product by 3.5% from the 2012 level. Efforts to reach the 2020 target of a 25% reduction from the level at end-2012 continue, and the target will be achieved through the following:
· Investment in new process technology · Optimisation of existing technology · Product development · Waste reduction · Increased share of renewable energy in production
Increased focus on safety Efforts to increase safety in Hartmann's European production in 2014 did not result in improvements as expected, and we have reported a slight increase in the number of work-related accidents per million working hours (LTI-FR). In order to increase safety at our factories, we have accelerated some of the planned activities, one of which is creating greater awareness of potential risks relating to specific processes and areas. We will also install new safety equipment in some of our factories' print shops where the number of work accidents is relatively higher than in other production areas.
In 2015, we will reduce the number of reported accidents per million working hours by 10% compared to the level in 2014.

Ownership At end 2014, Hartmann had approximately 2,100 registered shareholders, representing 6.5 million shares in aggregate, or 93% of the share capital.
The following shareholder has notified us that it holds 5% or more of the share capital:
· Thornico Holding A/S and related parties, Copenhagen, Denmark (68.6%).
At 31 December 2014, Hartmann held treasury shares representing 1.4% of the share capital.

At 31 December 2014, the members of Hartmann's Board of Directors and Executive Board held 0.2% of the shares. The members of the Board of Directors and Executive Board are registered on Hartmann's insider list, and they can only trade in Hartmann shares during a four-week period following the release of profit announcements or other similar financial announcements, as set out in Hartmann's internal rules. Trading in shares by insiders is subject to a reporting duty.

Dividend The Board of Directors takes the general view that excess capital should be distributed in the form of dividends or share buy-backs in order to generally maintain Hartmann's equity ratio at a maximum of 45%. However, the distribution of capital will always take into account our growth plans and liquidity needs. At the annual general meeting to be held on 8 April 2015, The Board of Directors will propose a distribution of dividends of DKK 9.50 per share for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 9.50), equivalent to DKK 66 million or a payout ratio of 56%.

Remuneration of the Executive Board If a controlling interest in Hartmann changes ownership, the notice period for members of the Executive Board is extended from 12 to a maximum of 24 months effective from the day on which the shares are sold. The extended notice will apply up to 18 months after the transfer.

Investor relations Hartmann's goal is to provide investors and analysts with the best possible insight into matters deemed relevant in ensuring an effective and fair pricing of the share. Our Executive Board and Investor Relations handle relations with investors and analysts, taking into consideration regulatory requirements and based on our corporate governance standards. Hartmann participates in selected seminars and holds individual meetings with Danish and international investors and analysts. For a period of four weeks up to the publication of the annual report, interim reports or other financial announcements, Hartmann does not comment on matters relating to the financial results or outlook.

corporate governance

Hartmann's statutory report on corporate governance for the 2014 financial year, cf. section 107 (b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act, is available at corporategovernance2014.hartmann-packaging.com.
The report contains a detailed account of Hartmann's management structure as well as a description of the main elements of our internal controls and risk management systems relating to financial reporting.

Changes in 2014 Ulrik Kolding Hartvig joined Hartmann as CEO on 1 January 2014.
Former Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors Walther Vishof Paulsen did not seek re-election and thus resigned at the general meeting in April 2014.

01 basis of preparation

02 accounting regulations

The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 of the group and Brødrene Hartmann A/S, respectively, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies, cf. the Danish Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS issued in pursuance of the Danish Financial Statements Act. Brødrene Hartmann A/S is a public limited company and has its registered office in Denmark.
The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is the presentation currency used for the group's operations and the functional currency of the parent company.
The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared on the basis of the historical cost convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value.
The accounting policies, which are described in note 39, have been applied consistently for the financial year and for the comparative figures.

New financial reporting standards and interpretations in 2014 Hartmann has implemented all new and revised financial reporting standards and interpretations adopted by the EU that are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Hartmann has assessed that the new and revised standards and interpretations that are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2014 are either not relevant to the group or the parent company, or not of significant importance.
New financial reporting standards which have not yet come into force and which have not been early adopted The IASB has issued a number of financial reporting standards, amendments and interpretations, with which the group and the parent company must comply for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
The financial reporting standards, amendments and interpretations that have not yet come into force are not considered to significantly affect the consolidated financial statements or the parent company in future financial years. However, the analysis of the expected impact of implementing IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 has not been finalised, see below.
IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments', which replaces IAS 39, changes the classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilites.

The standard introduces a more logical approach to classification of financial assets based on the business model applied in the enitity and the characteristics of the underlying cashflows. The standard also introduces a new impairment model for all financial assets.

IFRS 15 `Revenue from Contracts with Customers', which replaces the current revenue standards (IAS 11 and IAS 18) and interpretations, introduces a new framework for recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers.

The standard provides a five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers to determine when and how revenue is to be recognised in profit and loss.

03 significant Accounting estimates and judgments

In applying the group's and the parent company's accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions concerning the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be immediately inferred from other sources.
The judgments, estimates and assumptions made are based on historical experience and other relevant factors, which management considers reasonable under the circumstances, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

In January 2015, Tønder Fjernvarme notified Hartmann that it no longer requires district heating supplied by Hartmann's power plant. In continuation hereof, Hartmann has submitted a project proposal to Tønder municipality to be released from its service obligation to supply heat. The proposal is expected to be considered during the first six months of 2015, and it is management's expectation that Hartmann will be released from its service obligation. The power plant will then be included in the operating assets of the Tønder factory with valuation and profitablity depending on aggregate operations.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are assessed on an ongoing basis. Changes to accounting estimates are recognised in the reference period in which the change occurs and in future reference periods if the change affects both the period during which the change takes place and subsequent reference periods.
Significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties The recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities often depend on future events that are somewhat uncertain. In that connection, it is necessary to make an assumption that reflects management's assessment of the most likely course of events. In the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, the following assumptions and uncertainties are in particular to be noted, since they have had a significant influence on the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and may necessitate corrections in subsequent financial years if the assumed course of events fails to materialise as expected:

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment relating to the Power Plant was DKK 19.6 million at 31 December 2014. Receivables from Tønder Fjernvarme amounted to DKK 40.5 million.
Deferred tax assets In the measurement of deferred tax assets, it is assessed whether, on the basis of budgets and operating plans, future earnings will allow the utilisation of the temporary differences between tax bases and carrying amounts or tax loss carry-forwards. The assessment also includes pending tax audits. The net carrying amount of deferred tax assets was DKK 89.4 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 78.4 million). For a detailed description of the utilisation period etc., see note 22.
Allocation of purchase price In acquisition of companies, the acquired companies' assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised in accordance with the acquisition method. The main assets are goodwill, trademarks, customer portfolios, property, plant and equipment, receivables and inventories.

Power plant in Tønder In 2008, district heating company Tønder Fjernvarme filed a complaint with the the Secretariat of the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority (`the Secretariat') concerning the pricing of surplus heat from Hartmann's combined heat and power plant in Tønder, Denmark. By an advisory opinion passed by the Secretariat on 9 December 2014 Hartmann is required to adjust earlier invoiced amounts for district heating supplied in the years 2003-2013 by a total of DKK 45 million. Hartmann met with the Secretariat on 23 January 2015 for negotiations about the content of the opinion dated 9 December 2014, to which Hartmann disagrees. Upon the negotiations, the Secretariat resolved to reopen the case but no decision has been made as yet.
When a decision has been made, management will reassess whether to bring the case before the Danish Energy Board of Appeal.

For a substantial part of the assets and liabilities acquired, no efficient markets exist for determining the fair value. This is especially applicable for intangible assets acquired. Therefore, management makes estimates when determining the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Depending on the nature of the item, the fair value determination can be subject to uncertainty and possibly to subsequent adjustment. The non-allocated purchase price (positive amount) is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill, which is allocated to cash flow generating units.
The present value of estimated future cash flows is based on budgets and business plans, projections for subsequent years and management's expectations for the development. Essential parameters are revenue development, profit margin, future investments in property, plant and equipment as well as growth expectations for subsequent years. Man-

03 significant Accounting

Hartmann's activities are segmented on the basis of the geographical

estimates and judgments cont'd location of the reporting units.

agement expects that the purchase price recognised in the consolidated financial statements is the best estimate of the total fair value of the companies and thus the allocation of goodwill.
Trademarks In business combinations, an estimate is made of the value of the acquired trademarks as well as the expected useful life of these. The fair value of the acquired trademarks is calculated by discounting the royalty payments that will be saved through owning the right of use of the trademark (the relief-from-royalty method). The applied discount rate is after tax and reflects the risk-free interest rate.

No operating segments have been aggregated to represent the reporting segments.
The internal management reporting complies with the group's accounting policies. Business-related decisions on resource allocation and performance evaluation for each of the segments are made on the basis of the individual segment's operating profit before special items. Decisions relating to financing and taxation are made on the basis of information on Hartmann as a whole and are not allocated to the reporting segments. The pricing of intra-segmental transactions is made on an arm's length basis.

Customer portfolios In business combinations, the value of the acquired customer portfolios is estimated. The value is calculated as the present value of the net cash flow generated through sales to customers less return on other cash flow generating assets.
Fair value of property, plant and equipment The fair value of land and buildings and for technical and other plant acquired in business combinations is to the extent possible based on the fair value of a similar asset in similar condition, which can be bought and sold in an efficient market. The fair value of property, plant and equipment for which there is no reliable market documentation of the fair value is determined on the basis of a calculated value of the depreciated replacement cost. The determination is based on the replacement value of an equivalent asset that has the same functionality and capacity. The calculated replacement value of each asset is then reduced to reflect the functional and physical wear and tear.
The expected synergies and user-specific intentions with the use of the individual assets are not included in the assessment of the fair value.
For further information on allocation of purchase price, see note 37.
04Segment information
The reporting of business segments is in accordance with the internal reporting to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors. The Executive Board and the Board of Directors constitute the Chief Operating Decision Maker of Hartmann.

Segment income and expenses as well as segment assets and liabilities comprise those items that in the internal management reporting are directly attributed to each individual segment and those items that are indirectly allocated to the individual segments on a reliable basis. Profits in associates, financial income and expenses, income taxes, investments in associates, tax assets and tax liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents and bank debt are not allocated to reporting segments.
The reporting segments are:
· Europe comprising the production and sale of moulded-fibre packaging. The products are manufactured at factories in Europe (including Israel) and are primarily sold to egg producers, egg packing businesses and retail chains. The segment also comprises sales of machinery for the production of moulded-fibre packaging and the combined heat and power plant in Tønder, Denmark.
·North America comprising the production and sale of mouldedfibre packaging. The products are primarily manufactured at the North American factory and sold to egg producers, egg packing businesses and retail chains.
Other segment information External revenue is allocated to the geographical areas on the basis of the customer's geographical location. Allocation of intangible and property, plant and equipment is based on the geographical location of the assets.
No single customer represents more than 10% of external revenue.
Revenue from external customers attributable to a single foreign country is immaterial.

* The effect of the change in income tax rate is related to the deferred tax and is attributable to the gradual reduction in the Danish company tax rate from 25% in 2013 to 24.5% in 2014, 23.5% in 2015 and 22% in 2016 and onwards. The effect in 2014 is attributable to changed estimates as to when the temporary differences are realised in relation to what was expected when the annual report for 2013 was prepared.

Goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to the Europe segment.
Based on expected future net cash flows, management believes that the carrying amount of goodwill will not significantly exceed the recoverable amount. The estimate is based on the results achieved and the expected level of future earnings.
The recoverable amount is based on the value in use determined by means of expected net cash flows on the basis of approved budgets for 2015 and forecasts for the period 2016-2019 (the terminal period) and by using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2013: 10%) which takes into account the specific risks that characterise the European market. Growth in the terminal period has been set at 1% (2013: 1%), which is at level with the expected inflation. The present value of future net cash flows for the segment Europe considerably exceeds the value of the segment assets. Management also believes that the impairment test is not sensitive to fluctuations in the level of interest rates or growth assumptions.

Other intangible assets In 2014, development costs totalled DKK 0.1 million (2013: DKK 0.2 million), which are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under Selling and distribution costs.

No shares confer special rights.
Treasury shares Pursuant to an authorisation from the shareholders, Brødrene Hartmann A/S may acquire up to 10% of its own shares. The authorisation is valid until 8 October 2015.
Hartmann holds 100,000 treasury shares representing a nominal value of DKK 2 million, or 1.4% of the total share capital. The value of the shares at 31 December 2014 was DKK 17.3 million (2013: DKK 16.7 million).
Dividend Proposed dividend For the financial year ended 31 December 2014, the Board of Directors has proposed dividends of DKK 65.7 million (2013: DKK 65.7 million), corresponding to DKK 9.50 (2013: DKK 9.50) per share to be paid to the shareholders immediately after the annual general meeting to be held on 8 April 2015, subject to the shareholders' approval of the proposal. As the dividends are subject to approval by the shareholders, they have not been recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December 2014. Proposed dividend does not include dividend on treasury shares.
Dividend paid For the financial year ended 31 December 2014, Hartmann distributed dividends of DKK 65.7 million (2013: DKK 65.7 million), corresponding to DKK 9.50 (2013: DKK 9.50) per share.

26Pension obligations
Defined contribution plans Hartmann offers pension plans which cover certain groups of employees in Denmark and abroad. As a general rule, the pension plans are defined contribution plans under which Hartmann recognises regular payments of premiums to independent insurers who are responsible for the pension obligations (e.g. a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the salary). Under a defined contribution plan the group carries no risk in relation to future developments in interest rates, inflation, mortality or disability. Once the contributions under a defined contribution plan have been paid, Hartmann has no further pension obligations towards existing or former employees.
Defined benefit plans Under a defined benefit plan, Hartmann has an obligation to pay a specific benefit (e.g. retirement pension in the form of a fixed proportion of the exit salary). Under these plans, Hartmann carries the risk in relation to future developments in interest rates, inflation, mortality, etc. A change in the assumptions upon which the calculation is based results in a change in the actuarial net present value.
In the event of changes in the assumptions used in the calculation of defined benefit plans for existing and former employees, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The total pension obligations relate to funded plans in the subsidiary in Canada and unfunded plans in the subsidiary in Germany.
The weighted average duration of the obligations are 16-19 years in Canada and 15 years in Germany.

Hartmann regularly receives government grants for development-related and energy-saving projects. In 1995, Brødrene Hartmann A/S received a major grant towards the construction of the combined heat and power plant. No repayment obligations are currently linked to the grants.
In addition to the government grants to the parent company, Hartmann has received government grants for production companies in Germany and Hungary.
In the event that eligible assets in the German subsidiary are not used in accordance with the eligibility criteria, the repayment obligation will total DKK 0.1 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 0.2 million). The repayment obligation will be gradually reduced in the period until the end of 2015.
The Hungarian subsidiary has received government grants in the form of direct grants and reduced future tax payments. The grants are capped at 50% of the investment, corresponding to a nominal amount of DKK 72.3 million, of which direct grants represent a nominal amount of DKK 9.0 million. If the eligibility criteria are not met, future grants receivable in the form of reduced tax payments may be reduced or discontinued. Actual government grants received in the form of reduced tax payments was DKK 19.0 million accumulated at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 18.0 million).
Hartmann expects to meet the eligibility criteria for the grants received in Germany and Hungary, respectively.

31 provision of security and contingent liabilities
Guarantees Brødrende Hartmann A/S has provided a parent company guarantee to Hartmann (UK) Ltd. to allow them to claim exemption from audit under Section 479A of the British Companies Act 2006. At year end, the amounts owed to creditors of Hartmann (UK) Ltd. were DKK 0.8 million.
Joint taxation Brødrene Hartmann A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are jointly taxed with Thornico Holding A/S, which is the administratation company. The company thus has secondary liability with respect to income taxes etc. and any obligations to withhold taxes on interest, royalties and dividends applying to the jointly taxed companies. Such secondary liability is, however, capped at an amount equal to the portion of the share capital in the company held directly or indirectly by the ultimate parent.
Pending litigation As stated in note 3, Hartmann is party to a dispute with district heating company Tønder Fjernvarme concerning the pricing of surplus heat. In an advisory opinion dated 9 December 2014, the Secretariat of the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority (`the Secretariat') laid down principles for the pricing of district heating. The effect of this amounts to DKK 45 million concerning the years 2003-2013. Hartmann disagrees with the advisory opinion, and in negotiations with the Secretariat in a meeting held on 23 January 2015, Hartmann provided supplementary information in the matter. In continuation hereof, the Secretariat has decided to reopen the case. When the Secretariat has come to a decision in the matter, management will assess whether to bring the case before the Energy Board of Appeal. Furthermore, the group is party to a few lawsuits and disputes. Management believes that these lawsuits and disputes will not significantly affect the financial position of the group or the parent company.

33 other contractual obligations

In 2013, the parent company signed a three-year maintenance agreement for the company's combined heat and power plant. The contract term expires on 31 October 2016, and Hartmann incurred costs of DKK 2.9 million in 2014. The cost expected for 2015 is at the same level. Moreover, the heat and power plant is under an obligation to supply heat to the district heating company Tønder Fjernvarme unless the municipal council of Tønder resolves to change the heat supply. In 2013, Tønder Fjernvarme obtained approval for its project proposal to build a geothermal plant. Hartmann expects that the supply obligation will expire on or before commission of the geothermal plant. In a letter dated 7 January 2015, Tønder Fjernvarme notified Hartmann that with effect from 8 January 2015 it no longer required district heating supplies from Hartmann's power plant. In continuation hereof, Hartmann has requested the municipality of Tønder to be released from its obligation to supply heat.
34Financial risks

It is Hartmann's policy to assess on an ongoing basis if a proportion of the group's non-current credit facilities may be favourably converted into fixed-rate facilities using interest-rate swaps.
In December 2014, Hartmann refinanced its non-current credit facilities.
The credit facilities carry a floating rate and have not been converted into fixed-rate facilities.
A change in the general interest rate level by 1 percentage point would affect profit/loss for the year by approximately DKK 2 million (2013: DKK 1 million).
Currency risk Hartmann's currency risks consist of transaction risks and translation risks, respectively.
Hartmann is exposed to transaction risk due to cross-border transactions leading to contractual cash flows in foreign currency.

General risks Hartmann's financial results and equity are influenced by a number offinancial risks, among them interest rate, currency, liquidity and credit risks.

The USD/CAD exchange rate exposure constitutes one of the group's single largest transaction risks. This is a consequence of the fact that most sales generated in the North American business are invoiced in USD, while most costs are incurred in CAD.

See note 35 for a specification of financial instruments.
Financial risk management The guidelines for managing Hartmann's financial risks are set out in its finance policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
Hartmann uses financial instruments to hedge some of the financial risks that arise out of its commercial activities. The group does not engage in transactions for the purpose of speculation.
Hartmann has centralised the management of its financial risks in the central finance function, which also acts as a service centre to all subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk Hartmann's interest rate risk relates mainly to the group's interestbearing debt to credit institutions.
Management of interest rate risk It is Hartmann's policy to seek to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its profit/loss and financial position to the greatest extent possible
Financing is primarily arranged in the form of non-current, committed credit facilities in the group's main currencies, DKK and EUR.

Other significant transaction risks relate to the currencies CHF, EUR, GBP, HRK, HUF and PLN.
Due to its foreign subsidiaries, Hartmann is exposed to translation risks since a part of the group's earnings and net assets derive from these foreign subsidiaries and is therefore translated and included in the consolidated financial statements, which are presented in DKK.
In terms of net position, foreign subsidiaries' reporting in the currencies CAD, HRK, HUF and ILS represents Hartmann's greatest translation exposure.
Management of currency risk As part of its currency policy, Hartmann seeks to limit the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its profit/loss and financial position to the greatest extent possible.
Hartmann hedges its transaction risk to the effect that primary currencies are continuously hedged for a period of not less than 6 and not more than 12 months.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognised inprofit or loss when the hedged transactions are realised. The effectiveness of hedges is assessed on an ongoing basis.

34Financial risks cont'd

Translation risks are not hedged, as they do not have any direct impact on Hartmann's cash resources or underlying cash flows.
Currency risk relating to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not hedged.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Hartmann will be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due because of inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding.
Management of liquidity risk It is Hartmann's policy to ensure maximum flexibility and sufficient cash resources to allow the company to continue to operate adequately in case of unforeseen fluctuations in liquidity.
In December 2014, the group refinanced an existing committed credit facility. The new non-current, committed facility is a loan of DKK 350 million expiring on 31 December 2017 with an option to extend by up to 2 years. The group also entered a 5-year committed loan agreement to be used for the acquisition of subsidiaries in South America. The loan amounts to DKK 400 million.
The interest margin on both loans is floating and is fixed each quarter based on the group's earnings.
The loan is subject to standard covenants which Hartmann must observe in order to maintain the loan, including special financial covenants concerning the financial ratios `solvency' and `net interest-bearing debt' relative to `operating profit/(loss) before depreciation, amortisation and impairment'. In 2014, the group complied with all covenants.

The group's undrawn credit facilities with banks amounted to DKK 355 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 287 million). Cash amounted to DKK 56 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 46 million).Accordingly, total cash available to the group amounted to DKK 411 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: DKK 333 million). The calculation of total cash was done with due consideration to compliance with covenants.
Management believes that the group has sufficient cash resources to cover the ongoing financing of current and planned operations.
Credit risk Hartmann's credit risk arises in relation to the risk of losses on receivables, financial instruments with a positive fair value and cash.
Management of credit risk It is Hartmann's policy to take out credit insurance on its trade receivables. Circumstances may exist where local conditions make it impossible to take out credit insurance. In these cases, Hartmann applies a stricter internal credit assessment procedure, retrieving information on credit assessments from various information sources.
Provisions for bad debt are made individually. The credit risk in relation to receivables is assessed to have been included in carrying amounts.
It is Hartmann's policy to limit trading in derivative financial instruments and investments of surplus liquidity to banks with satisfactory credit ratings from one or more credit rating agencies.
Hartmann does not have any significant credit risk in relation to derivative financial instruments or cash. The maximum credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount.

The loan agreement further contains a number of provisions whereby significant credit facilities may be withdrawn in the event of a change of control of Hartmann.
The group's short-term liquidity is managed primarily by the transfer of liquidity from the subsidiaries to the parent company for the purpose of directing cash to units with cash requirements.
Financing in Hartmann's subsidiaries is primarily arranged through the parent company. However, local conditions may result in financing being arranged through one of the group's foreign banks.
The drawing rights are short-term credit facilities on which the group may draw and which may at any time be terminated by the bank.

Capital structure It is the group's objective to achieve a level of flexibility sufficient to carry out and fulfil the strategic objectives while at the same time ensuring a competitive yield for its shareholders. It is also an objective to secure financial stability for the purpose of reducing the cost of capital.
The Board of Directors takes the general view that excess capital should be distributed by means of dividends or share buy-backs in order to generally maintain Hartmann's equity ratio at a maximum of 45%. However, the level of dividend declared will always take into account Hartmann's growth plans and liquidity requirements. The agreement on the loan also contains restrictions with respect to Brødrene Hartmann A/S' possibility of distributing dividends, since changes in the general dividend policy are subject to consent from the bank.

The agreements concerning the loan and the drawing rights, respectively, contain cross default clauses.

At the annual general meeting to be held on 8 April 2015, the Board of Directors will propose that the company distribute dividends of DKK 9.50 per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2014.

FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Hartmann's primary currency exposure relates to sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group companies. Interest rate exposure relates to changes in the market rate applicable to the group's interest-bearing debt. Forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are used to hedge future cash flows. In accordance with the group's accounting policies, the fair value of financial instruments has been recognised in receivables and payables at 31 December 2014. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that qualify for hedge a ccounting as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows is based on observable data (level 2).

37 acquisitions
Business combinations after the balance sheet date On 6 January 2015, Hartmann completed the acquisition of the South American moulded-fibre activities of Lactosan Sanovo Holding A/S (`Sanovo Greenpack'). The transaction was executed as a share purchase. The allocation of the purchase price on the acquired assets and liabilities is expected to be included in the interim report for Q1 2015.
Sanovo Greenpack is South America's leading producer of moulded-fibre packaging for eggs and fruit with about 600 employees and four production facilities in Brazil and Argentina.
The purchase of Sanovo Greenpack falls within Hartmann's strategic goal of creating sustainable growth based on the company's strong market position and competitiveness. Hartmann is expanding its business volume significantly through its presence in the attractive growth markets in South America, strengthening the group's global position within production and sale of moulded-fibre egg packaging.
Sanovo Greenpack's revenue is derived from sales of moulded-fibre egg and fruit packaging to the attractive markets in Brazil and Argentina, which are characterized by favourable demographic trends and increasing urbanisation. In addition, the production facilities in Brazil and Argentina are based on machine technology developed and manufactured by Hartmann, which allows for synergies in operating and maintaining the machinery.

37 acquisitions cont'd
The fair value of the acquired technical plant is estimated on the basis of the depreciated replacement value. The fair value of the acquired finished goods and work in progress is determined on the basis of expected selling prices to be obtained in the course of normal business operations less expected completion costs and costs incurred to execute the sale, and with deduction of a reasonable profit on the sales effort and a reasonable profit on the completion. The fair value of the acquired raw materials and goods for sale is determined at replacement cost. An estimate is made of the value of the the acquired trademarks as well as the expected useful life of these. The fair value of the acquired trademarks is calculated by discounting the royalty payments that will be saved through owning the right of use of the trademark (the relief-from-royalty method). A discount rate in the level of 12-13% has been applied, depending on the market in question. The applied discount rate is after tax and reflects the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of customer relations is determined through use of the Multi-Period Excess Earnings method (MEEM). Customer relations are calculated as the present value of the net cash flow generated by sales to customers after deduction of a reasonable return on all other assets which contribute to generating the cash flows in question. The fair value of other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the continued use or sale of the assets. Receivables are valued at the present value of the amounts that are expected to be received less expected costs for collection. The group's loan interest rate before tax is used in the case of discounting. However, discounting is not used when the effect is immaterial. Liabilities are valued at the present value of the amounts that are required for settling the liabilities. The group's loan interest rate before tax is used in the case of discounting. However, discounting is not used when the effect is immaterial. Acquired net assets include trade receivables and services at a fair value of DKK 114 million. After recognition of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, goodwill relating to the acquisition has been determined at DKK 71 million. Goodwill represents the value of the existing staff, access to new markets as well as the expected synergies from the merger with Hartmann. The recognised goodwill is not tax deductible.

39 accounting policies

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company, Brødrene Hartmann A/S, and enterprises in which the parent company directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights or which the parent company in some other way controls (subsidiaries). Enterprises in which the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights and over which it exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, are considered associates. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the financial statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries by combining like items. The financial statements used for the annual report of the group have been prepared in accordance with the group's accounting policies. On consolidation, intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, balances, and realised and unrealised gains and losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated. The parent company's investments in the consolidated subsidiaries are set off against the parent company's share of the subsidiaries' fair value of identified net assets determined at the date of consolidation.
Business combinations Newly acquired enterprises are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The date of acquisition is the date on which control of the company is de facto taken over.
In the acquisition of new enterprises where the group obtains control over the acquired enterprise, the acquisition method is used under which the acquired enterprises' identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition. Restructuring costs are recognised in the takeover balance sheet only if they constitute an obligation for the acquiring enterprise. The tax effect of the revaluations performed is taken into account.
The purchase consideration of an enterprise consists of the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquired enterprise. If the final determination of the consideration is contingent on one or more future events, such events are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Positive balances (goodwill) between the purchase consideration for the acquired enterprise and the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised as an asset in intangible assets and tested for impairment at least annually. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, it is written down to the lower recoverable amount.
In the case of negative balances (negative goodwill) the fair values and the purchase consideration are reassessed. If the balance is still negative, it is recognised as income in profit or loss.

If at the date of acquisition there is uncertainty about the identification or measurement of acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the determination of the purchase consideration, the first recognition is made on the basis of initially calculated values. These values may be adjusted or additional assets or liabilities may be recognised until 12 months after the acquisition, if new information is obtained about circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition and which would have affected the calculation of the values on the date of acquisition had the information been known.
Subsequent changes in estimates of conditional purchase considerations are as a rule recognised directly in profit or loss.
Foreign currency translation A functional currency is designated for each of the reporting entities in the group. The functional currency is the currency used in the primary economic environment in which the reporting entity operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currency. On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Gains and losses arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the date of payment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under financial income and expenses, net. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Differences between the rate at the balance sheet date and the rate at the transaction date or the exchange rate stated in the latest annual report are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under financial income and expenses, net. On recognition of foreign subsidiaries and associates with functional currencies other than DKK, comprehensive income statement items are translated at the rate at the transaction date, and balance sheet items including goodwill are translated at the rate at the balance sheet date. The rate at the transaction date is calculated as the average rate of the individual month to the extent that this does not significantly distort the presentation.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of opening equity of these entities at the rate at the balance sheet date and on the translation of comprehensive income statement items from average rates to the rate at the balance sheet date are recognised in the consolidated financial statements in other comprehensive income in equity as a separate translation reserve. Foreign exchange adjustments of intra-group balances with foreign subsidiaries, which are considered part of the net investment in subsidiaries with functional currencies other than DKK, are recognised in the consolidated financial statements in other comprehensive income. Similarly, foreign exchange gains and losses on the parts of loans and derivative financial instruments

that are designated as hedges of foreign subsidiaries which effectively set off foreign exchange gains and losses on investments in the subsidiary are also recognised in the consolidated financial statements in other comprehensive income.
On full or partial divestment of a foreign entity or on the settlement of intra-group balances that are considered part of the net investment, the part of accumulated foreign exchange adjustment that is recognised in equity and that is attributable to that entity is recognised in profit/loss for the year together with any gains or losses from the divestment.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to limit its currency and interest rate exposure. Derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date of transaction and are subsequently recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is recognised in other receivables (positive value) and other payables (negative value). Realised and unrealised gains and losses on contracts are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under financial income and expenses, unless the derivative financial instruments have been used to hedge future cash flows. Value adjustments of derivative financial instruments used to hedge future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income if the hedge is effective. Value adjustments of any ineffective part of the relevant derivative financial instruments are recognised in financial income and expenses. When the hedged transaction is realised, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the same item as the hedged item, and the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reversed. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the accumulated net gains or net losses are taken to profit/loss for the year from other comprehensive income. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are computed on the basis of current market data and generally accepted valuation methods.
STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in profit/loss for the year provided that delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer has taken place at the balance sheet date and that the income can be reliably measured and is expected to be received. Revenue relating to services is recognised as and when the services are delivered. Revenue from minor repair and renovation work is recognised when the task is completed. In the case of major tasks, revenue is recognised as and when the tasks are performed. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration, excluding VAT and taxes charged on behalf of third parties. All discounts granted are recognised

in revenue. Construction contracts relating to production of moulding machines involving delivery of plant that is to a high degree individually designed are recognised in revenue in proportion to the work completed, so that revenue is matched with the sales value of the work carried out during the year (the percentage of completion method). If the profit or loss from a construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only for costs incurred to the extent that it is likely such costs will be recovered.
Production costs Production costs comprise direct and indirect costs including depreciation and amortisation and salaries incurred in generating the revenue for the year. Production costs also comprise research costs and any development costs not qualifying for capitalisation.
Amortisation of capitalised development costs is also recognised.
Selling and distribution costs Selling and distribution costs comprise costs in relation to freight, sales staff, advertising, exhibitions and depreciation.
Administrative costs Administrative expenses comprise expenses in relation to administrative staff, management, office premises, office expenses, depreciation and amortisation.
Other operating income and other operating expenses Other operating income and other operating expenses comprise items of a secondary nature, e.g. gains and losses from disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Operating profit/(loss) before special items Operating profit/(loss) before special items is a key figure for comparison with prior years.
Special items Special items comprise significant income and expenses of a special nature relative to the group's earnings-generating operating activities, such as the costs of extensive restructuring of processes and basic structural changes. Other significant amounts of a non-recurring nature are also recognised under the item, including impairment of property, plant and equipment, impairment of goodwill and gains and losses on the divestment of activities.
These items are presented separately in order to facilitate the comparability of the statement of comprehensive income and in order to provide a clearer presentation of operating profit. Special items arespecified in a note to the financial statements.

Profit/loss from investments in associates in the consolidated financial statement The proportionate share of the profit/loss from associates after tax and after elimination of the proportionate share of intra-group profit/ loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Dividend from investments in subsidiaries and associates in the parent company's financial statements Dividend from investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognised in the parent company's profit/loss for the financial year in which it is declared.
Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses comprise interest, realised and unrealised foreign exchange adjustments, market value adjustment of securities, amortisation and surcharges and refunds under the on-account tax scheme. Also included are realised and unrealised gains and losses relating to derivative financial instruments that cannot be classified as hedging instruments.
Tax on profit/(loss) for the year The group's Danish companies are jointly taxed with its principal shareholder, Thornico Holding A/S, and its Danish subsidiaries. The current Danish income tax liability is allocated among the companies of the tax pool in proportion to their taxable income (full allocation subject to reimbursement in respect of tax losses). Tax for the year, comprising current income tax for the year, joint taxation contributions for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year, including such changes as follow from changes in the tax rate, is recognised in profit/loss for the year, other comprehensive income or in equity, depending on where the item is recognised.
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The statement of cash flows shows the group's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year, changes in cash and bank debt and the opening and closing cash and bank debt.

Cash flows from financing activities Cash flows from financing activities comprise the raising and repayment of loans, changes in the amount or composition of the share capital including purchase and sale of treasury shares and related costs and dividend payments to shareholders.
Cash Cash comprises cash and current bank debt.
BALANCE SHEET Goodwill On initial recognition goodwill is recognised in the balance sheet at cost. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment. Goodwill is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the group's cash-generating units at the date of acquisition.The determination of cash-generating units is based on the management structure and internal financial controlling.
Other intangible assets Development projects comprise salaries, amortisation, and other costs attributable to the group's development activities. Development projects that are clearly defined and identifiable, and where the technical utilisation degree, sufficient resources and potential future market or development opportunities in the group are evidenced, and where the group intends to produce, market or use the project, are recognised as intangible assets provided that the cost can be measured reliably and there is sufficient assurance that future earnings or the net selling price can cover production costs, selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses as well as development costs. Development projects that do not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet are recognised in profit/loss for the year as and when the costs are incurred.
Costs for development and implementation of major IT systems are capitalised and amortised over the estimated economic life.
Other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.

Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are determined using the indirect method as operating profit/loss before special items adjusted for non-cash items, changes in working capital, interest paid and interest received, income taxes paid and restructuring costs paid.

Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over the estimated usefullife which is:
· Development projects, 5-10 years · Software etc., 5 years

Cash flows from investing activities Cash flows from investing activities comprise payments in connection with acquisition and divestment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, dividend received from associates and subsidiaries and government grants received.

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the asset is available for use. The cost of self-constructed assets comprises costs related to wages and salaries, materials, components and sub-suppliers. Borrowing costs are not recognised, if production periods are short. Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately. Subsequent costs, e.g. for the replacement of components of property, plant and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset when it is likely that the expenditure of the replacement involves future financial benefits to the group. The carrying amount of the replaced components is no longer recognised in the balance sheet, but is transferred to the profit/loss for the year. All other costs related to general repair and maintenance are recognised in profit/loss for the year as and when incurred. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets/components:
· Buildings and building parts, 10-25 years · Technical plant and machinery, 3-25 years · Operataing equipment and fixtures, 5-10 years · IT equipment including basic programs, 3-5 years
Land is not depreciated. The depreciation basis is determined taking into account the residual value and any impairment losses. The residual value is determined at the date of acquisition and is reassessed annually. If the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, depreciation will cease. If the depreciation period or the residual value is changed, the effect on depreciation going forward is recognised as a change in accounting estimates. Depreciation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as production costs, selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses, respectively. Gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. Gains or losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating income or in other operating expenses.
Investments in associates in the consolidated financial statements Investments in associates are measured using the equity method. Investments in associates are measured in the balance sheet at the proportionate share of the companies' equity value calculated in accordance with the group's accounting policies with deduction or addition of the proportionate share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses plus the carrying amount of goodwilll.

Investments in subsidiaries and associates in the parent company's financial statements Investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured at cost. Where the cost is higher than the recoverable amount, the investments are written down to such lower value.
Impairment of non-current assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, the first impairment test being performed prior to the expiry of the year of acquisition. Development projects in progress are also tested for impairment annually.
The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated and is written down to the recoverable amount in profit for the year if the carrying amount is higher.The recoverable amount is calculated as the net present value of expected future net cash flows from the enterprise or operation (cash generating unit) to which the goodwill is allocated. Deferred tax assets are tested for impairment annually and are written down if it is deemed likely that the deferred tax asset cannot be utilised against tax on future income or set off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. The assessment takes account of the type and nature of the recognised deferred tax asset, the estimated time frame for the set-off of the deferred tax asset etc. The carrying amount of other non-current assets is tested annually for any indication of impairment. When there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and the net present value of expected future net cash flows. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset or its cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are recognised in profit/loss for the year. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses on other assets are reversed to the extent that changes have occurred in the assumptions and estimates used to determine impairment. Reversals of impairment are made only to the extent that the new carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount it would have had net of depreciation or amortisation, had the write-down not been made.
Inventories Inventories are measured at cost using the FIFO method. Where the net realisable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value. Goods for resale, raw materials and consumables are measured at cost, comprising the purchase price plus delivery costs. Finished goods and work in progress are measured at cost, comprising the cost of raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and produc-

tion overheads. Production overheads comprise indirect materials and labour costs as well as maintenance and depreciation of production machinery, factory buildings and equipment and factory administration and management costs.
The net realisable value of inventories is determined as the selling price less costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale and is determined taking into account marketability, obsolescence and developments in the expected selling price.
Current and non-current receivables Receivables, including government grants receivable, are measured at amortised cost. If a receivable is deemed to be impaired, it is written down. Write-downs are made individually.
Prepayments Prepayments, recognised in assets, include expenses paid in respect of subsequent financial years.
Equity Dividend The amount proposed in dividends for the year is stated as a separate item in equity. Proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the time it is approved at the annual general meeting.

For defined benefit plans, annual actuarial calculations are made of the present value of future benefits payable under the pension plan. The present value is calculated based on assumptions of the future developments in variables such as salary levels, interest, inflation and mortality rates. The present value is only calculated for benefits earned by the employees through their employment with the group to date. The actuarial present value less the fair value of any plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet under pension obligations. The pension costs for the year, based on actuarial estimates and financial forecasts at the beginning of the year, are recognised in profit/loss for the year. The difference between the forecast development in pension assets and liabilities and the realised values is called actuarial gains or losses and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income via other comprehensive income. If a pension plan constitutes a net asset, the asset is recognised only insofar as it equals the value of future repayments under the plan or it leads to a reduction in future contributions to the plan.
Income tax and deferred tax Current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as tax computed on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on the taxable income of prior years and for tax paid on account. Joint taxation contributions payable and receivable are recognised as income tax in the balance sheet.

Treasury shares Costs of acquisition and divestment and dividend received on treasury shares acquired by the parent company or the subsidiaries are recognised as retained earnings in equity.
Currency translation reserve The translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements includes foreign exchange differences on the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries from their functional currency to the presentation currency of the group.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve contains the accumulated net change in fair value of hedging transactions that qualify as hedging of future cash flows and for which the hedged transaction has not yet been realised.
Pension ogligations Obligations relating to defined contribution plans, under which the group regularly pays fixed contributions into an independent pension fund, are recognised in profit/loss for the year in the period in which they are earned, and outstanding payments are recognised in the balance sheet under other payables.

Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax on temporary differences relating to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and office buildings and other items is not recognised where temporary differences ­ other than business acquisitions ­ arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either the profit/loss for the year or the taxable income. Where alternative tax rules can be applied to determine the tax base, deferred tax is measured on the basis of planned use of the asset as decided by management, or settlement of the liability, respectively. Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised under other non-current assets at the expected value of their utilisation, either as a set-off against tax on future earnings or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Adjustment is made to deferred tax relating to eliminations made of unrealised intra-group profits and losses. Deferred tax is measured according to the tax rules and at the tax rates applicable in the respective countries at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax.

Provisions Provisions are recognised when, as a result of events occurring before or at the balance sheet date, the group incurs a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that there may be an outflow of financial resources to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at management's best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Warranty commitments are recognised when goods and services are sold on the basis of warranty costs incurred in prior financial years.
Restructuring costs are recognised as liabilities when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been announced not later than at the balance sheet date to the parties affected by the plan.

Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recognised in the balance sheet under liabilities. The grants are recognised in profit/loss for the year over the useful lives of the assets.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The reporting of business segments is in accordance with the internal reporting to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors.
Hartmann's activities are segmented on the basis of the geographical location of the reporting units.
The internal management reporting complies with the group's accounting policies.

Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise debt to credit institutions, trade creditors, payables to subsidiaries and associates and other debt.
Debt to credit institutions is recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value (capital loss) is recognised in profit/loss for the year over the term of the loan.
Other liabilities are measured at the net realisable value.

Segment income and expenses as well as segment assets and liabilities comprise those items that in the internal management reporting are directly attributed to each individual segment and those items that are indirectly allocated to the individual segments on a reliable basis. Profits in associates, financial income and expenses, income taxes, investments in associates, tax assets and tax liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents and bank debt are not allocated to reporting segments.
The reporting segments are: · Europe · North America
