Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Shareholders,
2016 was a decidedly challenging year for our Group, characterised by the enthusiasm of the launch of the 2015-2020 business plan, presented to the market at the end of 2015, which called for determination and courage on the part of directors and the entire management in drawing up a forward-looking view of the market in the near future and our Group's positioning in it.
The global macro-economic context recorded growth in the global economy at a persistently low rate, slightly improved prospects in emerging economies but still uncertain in the main advanced countries. In Italy, GDP started to grow slightly in the third quarter, and despite the decrease in the last few months of the year, the climate of confidence stood at significant values.
In this context, the ICT market placed even more emphasis on the inevitability of the "digital transformation", driven by the renewed awareness of the manufacturing segment, and not only this. The term "industry 4.0" was coined for the connection of physical and digital systems, the use of intelligent and interconnected systems and the analysis of complex systems through Big Data and real-time adaptations. It has finally seemed to dawn that the awareness of digitalisation is the last chance for kick-starting Italian industry. The direction the market seems to have taken is the one outlined in our Business Plan.
All this has allowed the Italian ICT market to grow by 1.8% as a whole, with highs of 7.2% in the digital content segment and 5.7% in the software and ICT solutions segment, as reported to us in Assinform's analyses.
In the same period, the Exprivia Group recorded revenues of Euro 141.8 million compared to Euro 144.8 million in 2015, EBITDA of Euro 12.8 million compared to Euro 15.3 million in 2015, net profit of Euro 2.8 million compared to Euro 4.6 million in 2015. The net financial position fell by roughly Euro 500 thousand, sitting at a negative Euro 35.8 million, after having absorbed the debt of the company ACS, which joined the scope of Group consolidation in July 2016.
The fall in revenues is mainly due to the consequences of the slowdown of activities on the foreign markets and the delay in starting an important contract in the BPO services market, although this did not involve a downturn in the Group's position in the reference market, which actually strengthened its position in the Italian market in particular.
Profit margins were impacted not only by the decrease in revenues, but also non-recurring costs and the increase in the provision for risks, due to a tax dispute involving a subsidiary, which concerns a period before the Group acquired it. It should be pointed out that, net of these extraordinary costs, EBITDA would be Euro 14.1 million, equal to 9.9% of revenues, in line with the previous year.
Net profit amounted to Euro 2.8 million, also down like EBITDA, absorbing the positive trend of falling interest expense and the positive contribution of the tax discount obtained by applying the new Patent Box legislation, which two Group subsidiaries benefitted from, thanks to the investments in proprietary software products and technologies.
Therefore, our Group's performance on the Italian markets was generally positive. The industry market recorded growth of 10%, proof of the rather weak recovery in investments in the Italian production segment, driven by the digitalisation of processes. The Telco and Banking&Finance markets registered growth of 4% and 2% respectively. The Healthcare market recorded good staying power, despite the slight drop in extraordinary contracts. In the Energy market, the slowdown suffered as a result of the cost-saving policies of large clients, however, allowed the company to expand the scope of its offer to the redrafting of contracts for the benefit of future years.
The second half of 2016 also saw the company ACS join the scope of consolidation, the last acquisition of the Group, active in the space technologies market, and which accounted for Euro 4.2 million of ordinary
4

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
revenues. Operating in the market for more than twenty years, the company develops ground stations for the reception and processing of satellite data, a sector in which the company has achieved a position of leadership at European level, thus thrusting our Group forwards in one of the most promising markets of the near future. The year 2016 was also characterised by our Group's interest in a major extraordinary operation involving a large, long-established Italian industrial player operating in the design and development, in the international domain, of products and solutions for next-generation networks and telecommunications services. Its offer is composed of proprietary products, engineering services and consultancy on networks, services managed and solutions, the result of intense research and development activities. Our Group's objective is to establish a single entity in the market, ahead of schedule, capable of fusing IT and telecommunications skills in a single global operator, with a strong reference international presence, but also a solid and widespread presence in the Italian economic and social environment. I can affirm that this transaction, fully consistent with our Business Plan, would allow us to exceed the targets set therein and would lead to a business growth and development project whose economic and social significance involves not only our shareholders but the entire country and its skills in the technological and digital innovation sector. It is well-known that the procedure is still in progress. Exprivia obtained the exclusive right for negotiations until next 31 May. The discussion between the parties is, however, now concentrated on the details of the transaction which we hope to finalise soon. In this context, in order to protect all resources, therefore including financial resources, in view of such an important commitment for our company, and in compliance with a careful dividend distribution policy that is always adopted by the directors, the Board of Directors decided not to propose the distribution of dividends to the shareholders' meeting.
The Chairman Domenico Favuzzi

Space as driver of innovation The acquisition of ACS in July 2016 opens new markets with a high technological value and strengthens the Group's innovation impetus even further. ACS' offer focuses on the following areas:
 Ground Segment for the real-time acquisition and processing of data for Earth Observation  Remote sensing applications for monitoring of the land, study of climate change and handling of
environmental emergencies  Maritime traffic monitoring systems  Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications, usable on fixed and mobile devices.  Analysis of digital images in the space domain and technological transfer to new sectors
(biomedical, non-destructive testing, video-surveillance)
Public Sector
Cybersecurity, digital identity, digital documents and electronic payments: the Digital Agenda for Italy designs the economy 4.0, increasingly based on Big Data and the IoT. Intangibleinfrastructure and digitalcitizenship You can call it e-government, e-gov or digital administration: for us, it is just called innovation, simplicity and reliability for the protection of businesses, residents, public employees and the government. Bureaucratic streamlining through the digitalised management of the PA - along with organisational renewal activities - now allows for the reconciliation of spending optimisation with service quality, as it provides users with multiple rapid and effective communication channels that connect residents with public institutions and provide the latter with a series of worry-free and completely secure tools for completing administrative procedures. From this perspective, Exprivia has been able to rely on much of its experience in optimising processes for large private enterprises, which it has reconceptualised based on the needs of central and local governments and broken down into a range of areas, including:
 products and services for management (financial statements and accounting, human resources, management control, demographic services, document management, social services, etc.);
 eGovernment for relations with the public, businesses and institutions;  eProcurement for purchase processes and to monitor suppliers;  storage and sharing of electronic documents;  planning and control through business intelligence platforms and business analytics;  performance measurement in PA processes;  solutions to support administrative processes concerning self governance and cooperation between
administrations (SOA paradigm);  exchanging information between entities, citizens and businesses through a single point of access;  system integration for operational continuity 24/7 and automatic system repairs.

Industry
Exprivia rationalizes and reaches excellent levels of performance in the company processes of its customers, by modifying the entire value chain: from analysis to consulting, implementation, the Application and System Management services, also using proprietary, vertical solutions. The strategic relationship between the processes (increasingly simplified, quick and interlinked) and the in-depth knowledge of specific business features enables Exprivia to offer a tool for increasing the company's prospects of success.
Smart Manufacturing, digital innovation in industrial processes.
The recent research projects foreshadow a radical change in business scenarios: the fourth industrial revolution is in progress and will soon bring fully controlled, interconnected and automated production processes through the evolution of technology.
The expression "Industry 4.0", used for the first time at the Hanover Fair in 2011, defines this change in a panorama that is still evolving but already has precise development guidelines.
The four pillars of this transformation constitute the core of Exprivia's know-how and skills:
 use of data and connectivity (big data, open data, Internet of Things, machine-to-machine and cloud computing);
 analytics and machine learning;
 man/machine interaction (touch interfaces and augmented reality);
 digital/real interaction (additive manufacturing, robotic control, machine-to-machine interactions, storage of energy from various sources).
The impact of this transformation will be colossal, like that of the previous industrial revolutions brought over the centuries by steam, electricity, oil and computers and will only be quantifiable in the future. In the mean time, however, the clouding technologies are already influencing the work dynamics, which are evolving extremely rapidly. Every business must therefore introduce digital innovation in its industrial processes to gain the benefits of Smart Manufacturing.
Exprivia has taken this extraordinary opportunity by strengthening the entire industrial process with its digital solutions and automating the management of huge quantities of information in a simple, rational and efficient way, thus converting it into a strong presence on the market. This is the natural evolution of the vertical offer that Exprivia develops on the various industrial markets.

Healthcare
Managing health is more than simply controlling healthcare expenditure. The operators in this sector have been saying this for years. Relations between the regional government, the healthcare facilities and the users must be improved by adopting technological innovations. Exprivia is the ideal partner for a healthcare system oriented towards an excellent future that combines savings with efficacy and efficiency: its technological solutions for the healthcare system ensure absolute, simple and reliable technological coordination between the regional government and the healthcare provided by local health authorities, hospitals, ARNAS and IRCCS research centres, general and specialized hospitals, and domiciliary care systems. A team of 350 specialists, 30 years of operation in the IT sector, solutions and services at 500 hospitals for 20 million patients confirm the efficacy of the Exprivia solutions in satisfying the needs of the healthcare sector, of fundamental importance for the economy and development of every region. Suite of solutions The Regions with the most efficient health service are those that spend the most but also spend the best, that is, without causing overruns of the regional budgets. The Exprivia systems connect the entire Regional Healthcare system, from the administrative and management centres to the public and private hospital facilities along the entire supply chain, to the individual professionals and on-line services for users, so as to get the most from every resource. This is done using the e4Cure suite, expressly designed for the healthcare environment, which coordinates the two main branches of the health system:
 Local healthcare providers  Regional authorities and agencies creating interface flows that ensure total, structured control. Quality and riskmonitoring In addition to its ISO 9001 quality certification, Exprivia has set up an ISO 13485 Medical Device quality system for monitoring clinical risks.

Details of the net revenues relating to 2016 are shown below, compared with the figures for the same period of the previous year, broken down by geographic area (/1000).
Banking & Finance
The Banks, Finance and Insurance Business Unit closed 2016 with an increase of 2% over 2015, thanks in particular to the results in the second half, which boosted a first half that had closed in line with 2015. The market as a whole was characterised by a weaker first half in which developments in terms of a general political review of the national scenario were accompanied by international dynamics shaped by the BRExit referendum and its unexpected outcome. On the other hand, the second half witnessed a significant upturn in IT expenditure driven by both the increasingly more crucial legislative-regulatory component and, lastly, the needs to rebuild strong links with its customers, also thanks to new Digital Transformation tools. In this setting, the Business Unit managed to consolidate and expand its customer base, through the constant development of its overall offer portfolio, in support of Business Development initiatives. More specifically:
 the results in the finance area recorded growth of more than 8%, by virtue, in particular, of proactive monitoring of the customer base and expansion of the offer pertaining to the functional and regulatory component, as well as a greater number of capital market platforms;
 in the Credit Solutions domain, the closure of the period with an overall decrease of just 6.7% is attributable to the excellent performances in the last quarter (+33% compared to the 4th quarter of 2015), which made it possible, also thanks to the acquisition of two new customers, to recover strongly from the sharp downturn, especially due to the international component registered in the first nine months;
 despite 2016 being characterised by a partial turnover of the customer base, the results in the factoring segment, confirming the quality of the full outsourcing approach proposed, recorded growth of 2%, due, in particular, to the ability to adjust the specifications of the service provided to the needs of the individual customers;
 the results in the Digital Transformation domain (Big Data Analytics, Cloud & Security Infrastructure, Smart Process, Customer Experience) are in line with those of 2015, although achieved on a wider customer base and by virtue of a more marked and differentiated definition of the offer.
In conclusion, the results and the methods employed to achieve them determined a positive year. The evolution of the offer rewarded, especially in the second half of 2016, by the acquisition of new customers and the increase in the list of negotiations (pipeline), combined with the estimated rise in IT spending in this sector in 2017, lead us to reasonably predict positive development in Business Unit operations over the course of the next few quarters.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Telco & Media
In 2016, the Telco & Media business unit consolidated its growth of 4% with respect to the corresponding period
in the previous year (Euro 20 million in 2016, compared to Euro 19 million in 2015).
The company reinforced business relations with the main telecommunications players in Italy. Exprivia Telco & Media acquired major contracts linked to the activation of new broadband access networks, automation and streamlining of the business processes of its customers, to vertical data analytics solutions for the monitoring of quality KPIs and for the predictive maintenance of fixed and mobile network services, and the implementation of innovative solutions for telecommunications security and privacy.
Oil & Gas
Uncertainty in 2016 over the global demand for energy and the related prices of raw materials prompted Oil&Gas market operators to confirm their global investment reduction programmes launched in 2015 and to continue with disinvestment plans for less profitable or non-core activities. Investments were frozen at global level along the entire chain of value. Various transactions were finalised between the end of 2015 and 2016 which modified the corporate structures of some major market operators, and which drained additional resources from development projects.
ICT demand for the Oil&Gas market in Italy remains heavily concentrated on a few large operators which represent the Business Unit's main customers and which, despite maintaining the same levels of production as the previous year, registered substantial reductions in their profitability in 2016 due to the fall in the prices of energy commodities, which impacted Exploration&Production activities.
In this transition scenario, in 2016, Exprivia recorded a reduction of 19.2% in revenues in the Oil&Gas sector compared to the previous year (Euro 12.7 million in 2016 compared to Euro 15.7 million in 2015). In the first part of the year, Exprivia took part in a number of competitive processes, winning some significant multi-year contracts which helped the company reverse the trend of the previous few months in the final quarter. Revenues rose by 23% in the last quarter compared to the previous quarter (with the progress of project activities impacted by the holidays) and 7% compared to the revenues in the second quarter of the same year. Exprivia closed 2016 with a portfolio of contracts acquired during the year, but to be executed in the 2017-2018 period, worth more than Euro 15 million.
The reduction in revenues is in line with the fall in global ICT demand of the Oil&Gas market; therefore Exprivia did not lose its competitive positioning to its main competitors and, by being awarded the aforementioned tenders, actually managed to expand its perimeter of competence.
In addition to the vertical offer for the Oil&Gas sector, Exprivia continues to develop its offer in services for the digital transformation of Customer Engagement and Customer Operation processes, with a special focus on the development of new digital channels. The HSE offer is enriched by innovative solutions based on wearable technologies which provide access to new scenarios for the management of the safety of workers employed in high risk areas.
Utilities
In 2016, the Utilities Business Unit recorded revenues of Euro 21.5 million compared to Euro 21.9 million in 2015. The contracts commenced in the first quarter became fully operational in the second half of the year, allowing the company to reach, in line with the plans, the objectives set in terms of the value of production and operating margin, albeit recording a slight drop in revenues. The customer base was consolidated through greater diversification of activities by customer and the acquisition of customers not previously included in the portfolio.
26

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Revenues from offers in the most innovative sectors recorded growth; digital transformation, customer experience and customer journey, home & lifestyle, grid management.
BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) is specialised in Customer Care, both front office and back office. In 2016, revenues totalled Euro 5.7 million, compared to Euro 6.9 million in the same period of the previous year. The variation is attributable to external factors which delayed the start of two energy sector contracts won in 2015, one of which commenced in March 2016 and the other at the end of December. In fact, turnover in 2016 was concentrated on the start-up of the first contract, which is provided by the Molfetta branch, and the closing Back Office service assigned to another provider in the last quarter of the year. The two active contracts will follow a figurative life cycle of ten months, and whose overlapping effects will be visible in 2017 which, therefore, henceforth presents interesting increases in both turnover and profit margins.
Aerospace & Defence
The Defence & Aerospace Business Unit closed 2016 with revenues of Euro 6.6 million compared to Euro 3.3 million in the previous year. The change is primarily related to the contribution made by the acquisition of the new investment in ACS Srl.
Specifically, Exprivia's Defence sector confirmed a performance in line with the contraction seen in a market that is still being held back by the restructuring of the main industrial companies and the large entities operating therein, and by an intense focus on the reduction of spending. The start-up of significant national and European programmes during the year, in both the civil and military domains, should facilitate a normalisation of the market and subsequent recovery, creating room for growth for companies like Exprivia that operate in high technology content scenarios.
The innovative company ACS Srl, which has operated in the market for more than twenty years and develops ground stations for the reception and processing of satellite data, a sector in which it has reached a top global position, joined the Aerospace & Defence Business Unit in the third quarter of 2016. Over the years, ACS has expanded its offering by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the wide availability of Earth Observation data and the development of new technologies for studying the Earth. The increase in revenues in 2016 reflects the completion of some important contracts and the strengthening of ACS' presence in maintenance and operating support services for large satellite data acquisition and processing systems.
Public Sector
The revenues of the Public Sector Business Unit in 2016 amounted to roughly Euro 7.3 million compared to around Euro 8 million in 2015.
The results of the Central Public Administration recorded a slight drop in terms of turnover, when compared to 2015, due to the effects of the major spending review started in recent years on the entire sector. It should be noted that, in the fourth quarter, Exprivia won some important contracts from significant Central Public Administration institutions: Inail (National Institution for Insurance against Accidents in the Workplace) and MEF (Ministry of Economy and Finance). These contracts did not impact revenues in 2016, but will start to produce their effects in the second quarter of 2017.
Local Public Administration continues to witness a slowdown in activities (revenues of around Euro 2.6 million in 2016 compared to roughly Euro 3 million in 2015), only mitigated slightly in the last few months of 2016. The Local Public Administration still cannot find the right driving force for a radical change of ICT approach. By contrast, we are starting to see the first positive effects of the European 2014-2020 programming period getting up to full speed.
In general, the last few months of 2016 recorded a slight reversal of the trend recorded in the first few quarters. Some important entities showed a certain degree of enthusiasm, as a consequence of a general redefinition of the Digital Transformation targets, which have, by now, become a strategic objective for the entire sector.
27

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Industry
The 2016 results of the Industry BU showed a clear sign of growth in revenues compared to the previous year, confirming the positive trend that commenced in the first few months of the year. In 2016, revenues amounted to around Euro 12.8 million, compared to Euro 11.7 million in the same period of the previous financial year, marking an increase of 10%.
The industry segment is interpreting the signs of an economic recovery with confidence, by including investments in IT projects in the budget and beginning important technological innovation initiatives. The customer base was provided with design services, application management services and in-cloud services, as part of mature offers such as those relating to ERP, HCM and extended ERP processes, rather than relating to highly innovative issues, like CRM solutions applied to after sales processes.
Some industrial sectors have been more decisive in starting to invest again, such as Machinery, Retail and Consumer Products and Food. Strong results were obtained in international rollouts for customers with head offices in Italy, both in European countries and in the Far East and Latin America.
The experience acquired by Exprivia in the SAP S/4 and SAP Hana platforms are of great importance for the growth prospects of 2017 and the ensuing years, technological innovations introduced to the market by the German software vendor which are sparking huge interest from companies, in respect of which technological migration projects are in place, including with Cloud Computing methods.
Again in terms of the offer, positive results were achieved in the development of web solutions and portals, bringing the efforts capitalised on in our Research and Development laboratories to the market.
Healthcare
The year 2016 saw the continued concentration of demand at regional and central level, resulting in the general expectation of lower spending, also due to the entry into force of the new Tender Code, which slowed the publication of calls for tender even further. On the other hand, the reduction in current spending due to the spending review involved a general penalisation of revenues, stemming from the management of recurring services for Healthcare customers.
In this general scenario, the performance of EHIT in 2016 did not register phenomena as such to reverse this trend; net revenues fell slightly (-2%) compared to 2015.
The segment hardest hit by the spending review was that of the regional area, also as a result of the expiry of an important contract with the Puglia Region for the supply of the regional healthcare information system.
On the other hand, the medical area contributed with the roll-out of new projects, in both the private and public sectors, through contract works acquired at the end of 2015.
In the second half of 2016, major orders were also acquired and the conditions were put in place for the drawing up of contracts totalling Euro 16.8 million for the 2017-2019 three-year period, both for significant private and public institutions, especially new customers.
International business
Exprivia's activities on non-Italian markets registered a drop in revenues in 2016, down from Euro 10.4 million to Euro 7.8 million. The decrease in revenues is mostly concentrated in Spain and in Mexico, while other countries recorded stable or increased revenues.
In Spain, where the Exprivia Group was present through two subsidiaries, Profesionales de Sistemas Aplicaciones y Productos SL (ProSap) and Exprivia SL., their merger was completed in 2016 by combining the commercial and technical structures to strengthen the offer of ERP applications and SAP services for industry and distribution of Business Intelligence solutions for the Healthcare sector.
28

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The evolution of business in 2016 was not altogether satisfactory, even though company activities from August 2016 were targeted at economic-capital restructuring. Also in the final quarter they led to the stabilisation of revenue lines, through the containment of market risks. The cost structure was rationalised and adapted to developable revenues. The SAP business area essentially maintained activities with its customer base. The Business Intelligence area was reduced considerably, essentially owing to the decrease in investments by the biggest customer in the Healthcare sector. In Central America, where the Exprivia Group operates directly through con Prosap Mexico and Prosap Centroamerica (Guatemala), sales and delivery actions continued with major private and public companies operating in the infrastructure construction sector in Latin America countries. The Mexican company was also subject to economic-capital restructuring activities, whose effects were felt in the fourth quarter of the year in particular. With a view to stabilising relations in the area and better monitoring of country risk, sales and development initiatives were strengthened throughout the area; the branch in Ecuador that participated, as part of the RTI (temporary association of companies), in some significant public and private tenders in the Healthcare sector is waiting for the finalisation of the tender award procedures; the company Prosap Perù is waiting for sales initiatives in the healthcare and telecommunications domains which could inject fresh impetus. In Brazil, the revenues of the company Exprivia do Brasil Serviços de Informatica Ltda are in line with those of the previous year and therefore do not show growth, also due to the country's current macro-economic situation. Relations with the key customers in the IT Security area remain extremely strong however and promise new developments in 2017. In China, where "Exprivia IT Solutions (Shanghai) Co. Ltd", whose sole shareholder "Exprivia Asia Ltda" in Hong Kong, has developed its business in providing professional services in IT infrastructure and SAP. The year 2016 saw an increase of 40% in turnover compared to 2015; the customer base is still currently made up of Italian companies and institutions operating in China and European manufacturing industries.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Internal Risk
RISK RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT OF KEY STAFF MEMBERS
The success of the Exprivia Group mainly depends on the competence and skills of its workers. In addition to the executive directors of the Group and subsidiaries, the Exprivia Group also has senior managers with many years of experience in the sector who play a decisive role in managing the operations. Already in 2012 the company set up institutional processes to map and develop certified skills, thereby reducing the risk that the skills of certain key figures might become obsolete and to confirm the Group's ability to attract leading figures with a proven record for innovation. The programme for building loyalty and keeping the most skilled and deserving workers through performance management schemes, which include systems for rewarding key resources in the organisation.
RISK RELATED TO DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS
The Exprivia group provides services to companies operating in different markets (Healthcare, Public Administration, Banking and Finance, Telecom & Media, Industry, Aerospace and Media and Utilities). The revenue of the Group is well distributed over an array of customers but, nevertheless, the withdrawal of certain leading customers from the portfolio could weigh on the economic, capital and financial situation of the Exprivia Group.
RISK RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS
The Exprivia group develops high value solutions with a high technological content and related underlying contracts may provide for the application of penalties for compliance with stipulated terms and quality standards. The application of these penalties could have negative effects on the economic and financial results of the Exprivia Group. The Group has, therefore, stipulated insurance policies with leading insurance companies, considered adequate to safeguard itself from the risks arising from professional liability (the policy covering "all IT risks"). Should this cover be insufficient and Exprivia group required to pay for damages amounting to higher than the limit stipulated, the economic, capital and financial situation of the Exprivia group could suffer significant negative effects, in line, moreover, with risk parameters for the sector.
RISK RELATED TO INTERNATIONALISATION
In its internationalisation strategy the group could be exposed to typical risks deriving from the performance of business at an international level, which include changes in politics, macro-economic outlook, taxation and/or regulations, as well as currency variations. Nevertheless, the company was considerably active in foreign markets, where the country risk is considered under control and minor.
30

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
External Risk
RISK ARISING FROM THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF THE ECONOMY
The Information Technology market is naturally linked to trends in the economy. An unfavourable economic phase, particularly at a domestic level, could slow demand, which would result in a capital, economic and financial impact. The Group has proven its ability to react, raising and maintaining the necessary profitability even in the current stagnation in the global economy. The risks in this regard are related to the duration of this cycle and the number of variables connected to the national and international political-economic system.
RISK RELATED TO IT SERVICES
The ICT consulting services sector in which the Exprivia group operates features fast and profound technological changes and constant evolution of the composition of professionals and skills to gather in the creation of services, together with a need for constant development and updating of new products and services. The Exprivia group has always been able to anticipate these changes, and be ready for the needs of the market, also because of conspicuous investment in research and development.
RISK RELATED TO COMPETITION
The Exprivia Group competes in markets where the companies are - usually - rather large, which means remaining competitive depends on economy of scale and adequate pricing policies. The Exprivia Group mitigates this risk with continuing research and development, encouraged by the near-shoring centre of Molfetta, where it is possible to have access to human resources that are always in line with trends in the sector, especially considering the vicinity of the university and the extensive collaboration with the latter.
RISK RELATED TO CHANGES IN LEGISLATION
The work conducted by Exprivia Group is not subject to any specific legislation in the sector. Financial Risk
Financial Risk
INTEREST RATE RISK
Over the years Exprivia group has obtained various loans including several medium-long term at a fixed rate and others at a facilitated rate, the latter relating to funded research and development projects. Concerning variable rate loans, where considered necessary the Group stipulates interest rate swap agreements or cap agreements to hedge the risk of fluctuating interest rates.
CREDIT RISK
Exprivia group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk except for work carried out in the Public Administration sector, where delays are recorded mainly due to the payment policies adopted by public bodies. They often do not respect the conditions set forth in contracts but, nevertheless, they do not lead to the risk of bad debts.
31

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The group also manages this risk by selecting counterparts considered to be solvent by the market and with high credit standing. All amounts receivable are periodically assessed for each individual customer, and they are written down when they are considered impaired.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Prudent management of liquidity risk is pursued by planning cash flows, financing needs and the liquidity of the Exprivia group to ensure effective management of financial resources by managing any surplus liquidity, and by opening credit lines where necessary, including short-term ones.
EXCHANGE RATE RISK
Since the majority of operations conducted by the Exprivia group are in the Euro area there is limited exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions that are not in the usual currency (Euro). Opening up to markets characterised by major fluctuations (e.g., Brazil) might constitute a risk to be monitored, depending, however, on the volumes in place, which for the moment are not significant.
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2016
On 20 April 2016, the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of Exprivia SpA met on first call to approve the financial statements as at 31/12/2015, resolving the distribution of a dividend amounting to Euro 1,105,128.31, equal to Euro 0.0213 per share. The Corporate Governance and Ownership Report and the Remuneration Report for directors and management with strategic responsibility of the Exprivia Group were approved during the same shareholders' meeting. Both reports are published on the company's website in the "Corporate ­ Corporate Governance - Corporate Information" section. The Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting also approved the issuing of a new authorisation to purchase and dispose of own shares, pursuant to articles 2357 and 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code. On 28 April 2016, the company distributed a total dividend of Euro 1,044,774.63, of which (i) Euro 513,864.99 relating to the ISIN of the majority vote shares (loyalty shares) and (ii) Euro 530,909.64 for the other shares with normal ISIN, the difference with respect to profit allocated by the Shareholders' meeting to the dividend, is due to the dividends accrued by own shares held by the company which, as at 25 April 2016, amounted to 2,827,694.
Acquisitions/Sales in the Exprivia Group
On 11 April 2016, the deed of merger by incorporation by incorporation of Exprivia SLU in Prosap SLU was formally registered. The incorporating company Prosap took the name of the incorporated company Exprivia SLU. The transaction became effective retroactively for accounting and tax purposes on 1 January 2016. On 4 May 2016, the activities required to close Prosap US Holding Ltd and its subsidiary Prosap Consulting LLC were completed. On 22 June 2016, Exprivia completed the acquisition of ACS S.p.A., an innovative company operating in the field of software applications and systems for the space sector. On 5 July 2016, Exprivia SpA acquired de facto control over ACS, transformed from a SpA (joint-stock company) to a Srl (limited liability company) following the appointment by the sole shareholder Exprivia of the administration and control bodies. Exprivia, which already held a stake of 16.2% in ACS, increased its shareholding to become the sole

STOCK PERFORMANCE
The graph below shows the performance of Exprivia stock on the FTSE Italia Star index in 2016 (closing at 100 at 1 January 2016).
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
In 2016, the Group implemented innovative projects for its customers in all markets served; from systems for the management of the radiology process of major national Healthcare providers, to IoT and Big Data solutions for the monitoring of rail networks, to human-machine interfaces for rendering algorithms of 3D scenarios in augmented reality. The Group continued to invest in research and, as part of the growth process, finalised the acquisition of a company operating in the space technologies sector and opened a new branch in Palermo. Therefore, the company continues to implement the 2015-2020 Business Plan which it presented to the market at the end of 2015, in the context of the "digital transformation", driven by companies' renewed awareness of the need to digitalise the chain of company processes through the new solutions offered by ICT. The ICT market, as a whole, is experiencing a phase of consolidation in which increasingly larger players are responding to the need for a greater presence in the entre chain of value of customers, therefore, it rewards its players increasingly more for their capacity for investment and innovation. Our Group now measures itself against large international players, capable of benefitting from economies of scale as a differentiating element and competitive advantage. In 2017, management commenced a reorganisation of the Group's internal structure, targeted at assessing the benefits of management of the business as a single unit, aimed at improving the efficiency of decision-making and competitive processes. The year 2016 was also characterised by our Group's interest in a large, long-established Italian industrial player operating in the design and development, in the international domain, of products and solutions for next-generation networks and telecommunications services.

In consideration of all of the above, the company believes that the economic context, despite the continued high volatility, allows us to presume potential growth in line with the cornerstones of its Business Plan.
INVESTMENTS
EXPRIVIA SPA'S REAL ESTATE
All the real estate of the Group is in the name of the Holding Company Exprivia SpA. The property in Viale PIO XI 40 in Molfetta (BA) consists of two rooms totalling about 120 sq. m . The Company's current head offices, located in Molfetta (BA), Via Adriano Olivetti 11, covers a surface area of about 8,000 sq. m on which there is a complex of buildings (made up of four blocks, three of which are multi-story). All of these are office space and warehouses for a net total of approximately 5,000 sq. m of office space. In 2013, an investment project, which began in 2013, was concluded. Its aim was to bolster and improve the logistics of the head offices of the Holding Company Exprivia thereby making the latter more functional and agreeable for clients. Training programmes on the most modern IT technologies for large groups of people are organised and carried out at the Molfetta office. The development of technical staff, both internal staff and customers, is based on continuing professional training and education. The areas dedicated to IT instrumentation, equipped with advanced security systems, are perfectly able to host not only the current equipment necessary for the management and development of the Group's infrastructure and R&D Laboratory, but also additional IT systems used to provide the market with complete solutions for development projects and outsourcing with the most sophisticated security systems and non-stop operations. In April 2012 Exprivia SpA transferred its Milan branch from Via Esterle 9 to Via dei Valtorta 43, thus occupying a rented independent three-storey building with a total of 2,500 sq. m of floor space available for office use. The Company started expanding its Molfetta production unit during the first half of 2012, a project provided for in the programme agreement signed with the Regione Puglia on 5 December 2011 for a total value of Euro 10.4 million. The first stage of the investment in material assets, totalling Euro 5.6 million, is the erection of a new four-storey office building with a total of 2,500 sq. m of floor space, which was completed in February 2014. The second phase involved the renovation of offices in Via Olivetti (Molfetta, Italy) and bolstering of electrical and network infrastructures, which was completed on 30 June 2014. In November 2014, Exprivia SpA held a public institutional event to present the restyling of the offices in Via Olivetti and the new building. In December 2014 Exprivia SpA transferred its Rome office from Via C. Colombo, 456 to Viale del Tintoretto, 432. It occupies an entire floor with a total surface are of 2,036 sq. m, thus making it possible to integrate all the personnel of the Exprivia subsidiaries: Exprivia Telco & Media and Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl. The main goal of the new offices, built on a project commissioned by Exprivia SpA, was to create a representative office as well as an operational office. The project enabled a significant expansion of office space, in addition to bolstering ICT infrastructure. In January 2015, new offices were identified for the Vicenza production unit, in the Serenissima Area of East Vicenza, in via Zamenhoff 200 with an area covering 500 sq. m, to which all personnel present in the old Via

Benedetto Marcello office were transferred in April 2015. The new office has architectural and service characteristics in line with the Group's renovated offices.
ACS SRL'S REAL ESTATE
Acquisition of the ACS Srl investment increased the Exprivia Group's real estate; in particular, ACS owns the site in Rome, in via della Bufalotta 378. The site is composed of two lots: the first, measuring around 1,250 m2 is owned by the company, the second, covering roughly 1,050 m2, is used under a property lease, with the possibility of redemption at maturity in 2019.
Research & Development
In line with the previous Strategic Business Plan, in collaboration with the company business units, the objectives of the research programmes active in 2016 were essentially met successfully. The main priorities of the Research & Development programme were as follows: Sanità 2.0 and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).
All Research & Development projects are backed by co-financing from the participation in national tenders for research promoted by the competent Ministries and Regional Administrations.
Sanità 2.0.
As regards healthcare, in 2015 Exprivia essentially concluded project DSE through the participation in the Public-Private Laboratory SILAB. The public-private laboratory ensured the following objectives:
- the production of a prototype DSE-IT platform which supports the management of a Digital Services Ecosystem;
- the creation of Healthcare services and solutions.
Exprivia has made a significant contribution to the creation of the platform and has developed a Therapeutic Compliance solution, which it aims to test.
The ActiveAgeing@Home project was also essentially completed, financed as part of the cluster "Technologies for Living Environments", which Exprivia participated in through the MIUR tender for the definition of National Cluster Technologies (Directors' Decision 257/Ric of 30 May 2012). The project tackled the issues of monitoring health and remote assistance for vulnerable persons, with special attention to people with neurological disabilities. Exprivia provided its specialist skills in the sector and created solutions to support patients and their "caregivers".
Intelligent Transportation System
The ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) Italy 2020 project is underway. It was acquired as part of the tender for National Technological Clusters, through the participation in the National Technological Cluster "Means and systems for mobility on land and sea". The object of the innovation is to define technological standards and communications protocols to develop national intermodal logistics.
Lastly, following a laborious administrative process, Exprivia took part in the MISE Horizon 2020 and Grandi progetti (`large projects') tenders. In collaboration with its partners, Exprivia presented two project proposals respectively:
- BIG IMAGING: "BIG DATA" and Genomic Imaging for the development of innovative nano vector biological indicators and drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory processes in dementia;
- FINDUSTRY 4.0: the ultimate objective is to define, create and provide a platform able to offer technologies, ICT systems and expertise, as well as methodological support which enables the dissemination and adoption of technologies that allow digital innovation in the Italian manufacturing sector.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
- ACS has always been geared towards technological innovation, which is a distinctive trait of its Aerospace offering. And with this in mind, ACS is committed to various Research projects, financed by national and European programmes.
The GAPS project, co-financed by the Ministry of Economic Development, aims to trial new SAR satellite data processing techniques based on the use of GPGPU cards. The project, which will end in the middle of 2017, has delivered extremely interesting results, which are already being applied to systems proposed by ACS. The EVER-EST project, financed by the EC as part of the Horizon 2020 programme, aims to create a virtual collaboration environment. The recipients of this system are Earth Sciences researchers, who represent the main users of the remotely sensed satellite data. The project, coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA), represents an important opportunity for expanding the offer to final users of remote sensing. The European project MELODIES, co-financed in the FP7 domain and concluded recently, made it possible to examine the Linked Open Data themes in depth, with a particular focus on oceanographic data. The experience gained in this project can easily be used in the Space and PA domain offers. SpaceNav is a European project co-financed by the 7th Framework Research Programme. SpaceNav's objective is to develop innovative techniques for optimising commercial shipping routes. The system developed by SpaceNav uses the data remotely sensed by satellites to create navigation plans that reduce consumption, emissions and the costs connected with maintenance and inspections.

MANAGEMENT TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The Exprivia Group invests by focusing, in particular, on developing skills and expertise in a context strongly geared towards innovation. The new business plan includes new major investments in training and development on particularly innovative matters. The analysis of gaps in skills, on which investment policies are based, is linked to an annual process of mapping and balancing of skills identified as the Skill Inventory. The Organisation Development office provides support to the companies in the Group by:
 Managing performance and remuneration plans (Performance Management);  Professional development (Training);  Optimisation of the personnel placement and reallocation process (Selection and Orientation
department). For all the companies in the Group remuneration is connected to results achieved by each individual, and it was designed to be sustainable and compatible with company results while ensuring the approach is based on merit.
In 2016, initiatives were launched linked to individual and organisational well-being and to social organisation:
 Company Welfare ­ Exprivia People Care. The entire company population benefitted from: Supplementary healthcare insurance to cover individual and family welfare; a flexible welfare package that the employee can put together based on individual and family requirements, choosing from services connected with:
40

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
 education, family support, goods and services in kind, associated with the concessions set forth in art. 51 of the Income Tax Consolidation Act (TUIR);
 arrangements to support work-life balance (family care, easy shopping, culture) deductible within the limit of 5 per thousand of staff costs.
Company Smartphones and SIMs with unlimited data and telephone calls; restaurant e-tickets.
 Enterprise Social Collaboration ­ through an experimental process, we have launched social collaboration at the company to improve the levels of connection, interaction and sharing of expertise and skills, in particular, in order to:
 raise the quali-quantitative level of internal communication  put in place an effective vehicle for knowledge and facilitating collaboration  promote the correlation between good staff management practices and company
performance  analyse and collect information in the field using a bottom-up approach  favour the fusion, innovation and dissemination of ideas  pro-actively involve highly valued personnel  improve Exprivia's brand and corporate identity  adopt a vehicle for organisational change  facilitate the introduction of smart working.  Smart Working ­ through an experimental programme, we launched a flexible work method for managing time and space, reconciling personal and work needs. The company population is expected to be involved in the experimental phase, with 10% of the total Italian population involved.
In terms of Training, the Training Master Plan 2016, a planning tool for training, provided for approximately 10,298 hours of training for 945 participants compared to 20,435 hours of training in 2015. In particular, the 2016 plan made provision for additional financed training initiatives of around 10,000 hours which, owing to restrictions deriving from the financing, can be provided in 2017.
The training courses were set up at the start of the year and reviewed every quarter in order to make the training investment policies consistent with the objectives of each business unit and sustainable with respect to budget targets. The training programmes, not including those on regulatory provisions (e.g., safety at the workplace), were organised in accordance with regulatory requirements and designed according to market and investment needs. In particular, training programmes concerned the development of:
 specialised technical skills: measures for developing technical knowledge and skills to support technological innovation and development programmes, through specialised training plans, also for the purpose of obtaining certification. These specialisation courses were held for all ICT roles in the firm belief that improving skills means raising the value of persons and so the competitive advantage of the organisation. Of particular interest were training courses regarding SALESFORCE, ORACLE EBS HCM, SCRUM MASTER, BUSINESS ANALYST BASICS, TIBCO, SAP HANA, SAP FIORI.
41

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
 management skills: measures to develop managerial skills of the Exprivia Group's middle management, i.e. focused on improving organisational conduct. The following professional development courses are specifically noted: 1. Training course for the PMP-Project Management Professional certification: we defined a new training process in blended mode, part e-learning (asynchronous support) part classroom-based (instructor-centred), after having verified that the traditional classroom-based courses were not sufficient for adequately preparing candidates for passing the PMP certification exam. In the new mode, training alternates between instructor-centred lessons in the classroom and distance tutoring, in environments for discussion and publication of contents that allow pupils to be adequately and continuously supported during the exam preparation phase; 2. Re-training process in Application Management on the TIBCO platform: training process and on-the-job training for the re-training of personnel in order to offer new professional opportunities in the Exprivia Group.
The training programmes involved resources from several companies in the Group, encouraging integration of organisational cultures and experiences acquired in different markets. Exprivia has always aimed at the attainment of technical certification for its personnel, in this way ensuring its customers with the objective certification of the technical abilities of its staff involved in the projects. In 2016, 184 certification exams were taken and 147 were passed with success (80%). As regards the Business Process Outsourcing unit (Contact Centre), the following courses were held:
 About 4,003 hours dedicated to continuous training in order to improve the performance of our workers for the activities in question. These hours involved around 4,245 participants.
 About 1,378 hours dedicated to specialised training to enable our workers to deal with new activities. These initiatives involved about 595 participants.
 Around 11,375 hours dedicated to new entry training. These initiatives involved about 125 participants.
Concerning Orientation, Recruiting and Selection, in 2016 about 130 new staff were hired, including new graduates and workers qualified in technical/IT disciplines and process experts. A total of 62 new workers were placed in the contact centre. Furthermore, 236 staff were hired in the Business Process Outsourcing Business Unit (Contact Centre), following the launch of the new company Exprivia Process Outsourcing Srl based in Palermo. The selection processes were targeted at those with specialised skills in order to reinforce the associated Business Units and, therefore, Exprivia's competitiveness in each of the reference markets.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Also in 2016, as in the past, Exprivia invested in the continuous links with schools, universities, polytechnics and research centres, fully aware of its role in generating innovation and opportunities for young undergraduate students and graduates. This collaboration materialises in:  school/work projects; we should report that on 31 May 2016, we launched School-Work Projects.
School-work projects consist of the creation of processes designed, implemented, verified and assessed, under the responsibility of the educational institution, based on the appropriate agreements with the companies willing to take on students for periods of learning on the job, which do not constitute individual employment relationships. The school/work project processes are naturally included in the three-yearly plan of the training offer of the educational institution as an integral part of the educational courses (from 3rd to 5th school year); therefore, they were launched in 2016 and will continue until 2018. The school/work programme involves 129 students from 9 higher education institutes in the Puglia region, for a total average of 200 hours per student in the three-year period;  Internships for final-year university students to carry out innovative projects for specific markets;  Post-graduate internships to provide the opportunity to gain experience in areas directly related to business administration, or research projects in research and development laboratories;  Funding for doctorate programmes or high-level internships to combine research with market needs.

STAFF AND TURNOVER
Tables are provided below which show the staff of the Group companies as at 31 December 2016, compared with the figure at 31 December 2015 and the average number of employees and temporary workers for the years 2016 and 2015. In particular, the first table (table 1) reports the number of resources, around 25.65% of whom are part-time; part-time can involve various arrangements in terms of contract hours. The second table shows the number of full-time equivalent workers (on an annual basis) (Table 2): Table 1.
Table 2.
As regards the FTE table (Table 2), the figure for employees as at 31.12.2016, unlike the figure at 31.12.2015, does not include resources subject to CIGO [ordinary wages guarantee fund]/CIGD [extraordinary wages guarantee fund]/absences due to long-term illnesses. The number of employees and temporary workers in the foreign perimeter as at 31 December 2016, reported in tables 1 and 2, with
44

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
respect to the same figure at 31.12.2015, felt the effects of a revision and reclassification of employees and temporary workers, which took place in 2016, to make them more consistent with Italian regulatory standards. This generates a difference in the number of employees and temporary workers between the 2015 and 2016 figures. Similarly and, as a consequence, the average figure as at 31.12.2015 changes, reported in this report, with respect to the figure published as at 31.12.2015 in the previous report. The tables below show the number of incoming and outgoing resources, by contractual group and by Company.

MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL ORGANISATION MODEL (PURSUANT TO LEGISLATIVE DECREE 231/2001)
Effective 31 March 2008, Exprivia adopted its Organisation, Management and Control model under Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and set up a Supervisory Body. None of its members are directors of Group companies. This model is integrated with the principles and provisions of the Exprivia Ethics Code.

INTER-COMPANY RELATIONS
The organisational structure of the Exprivia Group functionally integrates all staff services of the Group subsidiaries within the consolidation area, thereby optimising the operational structures of each company to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in supporting the business of the Group. The Administration, Finance and Control Department unites the Group Finance function with the Administration, Finance and Control functions. The Human Resource Department reports directly to the Chairman of the Exprivia Group, who is the head of the department ad interim. The Internal Audit, Merger & Acquisition, Corporate Affairs and International Business Departments also report to the Chairman. The Group companies constantly collaborate with each other for commercial, technological and application development. In particular the following should be pointed out:
 widespread use of specific corporate marketing and communication competencies within the group including the production of paper, digital and web-based promotional material;
 centralised management for the supply of specialist technical resources between group companies to manage critical points in turnover and to give all operational units access to highly specialised technical competencies;
 coordinated participation by Exprivia in public contract tenders with the contribution of all companies according to their specific competencies.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE EXPRIVIA GROUP
LEGAL REFERENCES, PREPARATION POLICIES AND PRESENTATION
In application of European Regulation No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 and Legislative Decree no. 38 of 28 February 2005, the consolidated financial statements of the Exprivia Group and the financial statements of the parent company Exprivia SpA as at 31 December 2016, were drawn up in compliance with International Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), approved by the European Union (hereinafter referred to individually as IAS/IFRS or together as IFRS) in force as at 31 December 2016. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the draft financial statements as at 31 December 2016 provided by the management bodies of the consolidated companies. Where necessary, they were duly adjusted to bring them in line with the classification policies and accounting standards adopted by the Group. The consolidated financial statements were prepared under the general policy of giving an accurate and truthful presentation of the Group's financial standing, economic result and cash flows, while adopting the going-concern assumption, and the general policies of accrual basis accounting, presentation coherence, relevance and aggregation, rule against offsetting and comparability of information. The reporting period and the closing date for preparing the consolidated financial statements correspond to those of the financial statements for the Holding Company and for all the consolidated companies. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the currency used by the Holding Company Exprivia SpA, and all figures are rounded off to the euro, unless stated otherwise. The consolidated financial statements provide comparative information referring to the previous financial year. The schedules in the financial statements are the following:
o For the balance sheet the current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities are posted separately. Current assets are those that are to be made, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Group. Current liabilities are those that are to be extinguished during the normal operating cycle of the Group or within twelve months following the end of the financial year;
o For the income statement, the cost and revenue items are posted according to their nature; o For the comprehensive income statement, a separate schedule was prepared; o For the cash flow statement, the indirect method was used.
Adjustments to comparative data
In order to make the presentation of data more intelligible, the presentation was changed for certain items in the comparative data of the income statement presented in accordance with IAS 1, with respect to data published in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015. This had no effect on the result and net equity at that date. In particular, the balance as at 31 December 2015, presented for comparative purposes, of the item "Costs for services" increased compared to the data published in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 by Euro 533 thousand (from Euro 21,726,478 to Euro 22,259,052) with reference to bank fees previously recognised under "Sundry operating expenses", the balance of which fell from Euro 1,511,903 to Euro 979,329.

Drafting and presentation criteria
The accounting policies and valuation criteria are those adopted to prepare the financial statements as at 31 December 2016. The valuation and measurement policies are based on the IFRS standards in effect as at 31 December 2016 and approved by the European Union. The following table contains the list of international accounting standards and interpretations approved by the IASB and endorsed for adoption in Europe and applied for the first time to the current year.
The adoption of these standards did not have any material impact on the valuation of the Exprivia Group's assets, liabilities, costs and revenues. The amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 "Investment Entities", clarifies some aspects relating to investment entities. The amendments made to IFRS 10 confirm the exemption from the drafting of consolidated financial statements for an intermediate parent (that is not an investment entity) which is controlled by an investment entity. As regards IAS 28, the standard was amended in relation to investments held in associates or joint ventures that are "investment entities": these investments can be valued using the equity method or at fair value. The amendment to IAS 27 "Separate Financial Statements" introduced the option to account for investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures using the equity method, while previously IAS 27 required that they should be accounted for at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9 (IAS 39 for entities that did not adopt IFRS 9). The amendments to IAS 1 "Disclosure Initiative (amendments to IAS 1)", clarify certain aspects concerning the presentation of financial statements highlighting the emphasis on the importance of information (disclosures) in the financial statements, specifying that there is no longer a specific order for presenting explanatory notes and giving the possibility to group/ungroup items so that items considered as minimum content under IAS 1 can be grouped together when not considered significant. The 2012-2014 improvements cycle brought amendments to certain accounting standards, especially concerning certain aspects not considered clear. In particular, the amendments concerned:
63

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
· lo IAS 19 "Employee benefits", where the IASB clarified that the discount rate for an obligation under a defined benefit plan should be determined on the basis of "high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds" identified in the same currency used to pay the benefits; · IFRS 7 "Financial instruments - disclosures": the IASB clarified that an entity transferring financial assets and derecognising them from its balance sheet is required to disclose any continuing involvement, where existing. In addition to the disclosures required by IFRS 7 concerning offsetting financial assets and liabilities this is required only for the annual report and provided in the interim financial statements only where deemed necessary; · IAS 34, where the IASB clarified that the disclosures required under this standard can be included in the notes to the interim financial statements, or they can be included in other documents (such as the risk reports), by providing references to them in the interim financial statements, as long as the users of the interim financial statements have access to the same conditions and timeframes as the interim financial statements. The annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle also includes amendments to IFRS 5 "Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", which are currently not applicable to the Exprivia group. With the amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 38 "Property, Plant and Equipment", the IASB clarified that a depreciation process according to revenues cannot be applied for property, plant and equipment since this method is based on factors, for instance volumes and sale prices that do not represent the actual consumption of the economic benefits of the asset. IFRS 11 "Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations" clarifies how to account for the acquisition of interests in joint operations that constitute a business. Amendments to IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment" and to IAS 41 "Agriculture" concern accounting rules for fruit trees. The amendment to IAS 19 "Employee Benefits" concerns accounting for defined employee benefits plans that envisage contributions from third-parties or employees. The IFRS 2010-2012 annual improvements include minor amendments to several standards for sections that needed clarification. In brief: · with amendments to IFRS 2 "share-based payments", the IASB clarified the criteria and characteristics that a performance condition should meet; · with the amendment to IFRS 3 "Business Combinations", the IASB clarified aspects for the classification and valuation of contingent considerations; · with the amendment to IFRS 8 "Operating Segments", the IASB introduced a new disclosure requirement to include a brief description of the operating segments that were aggregated and the financial indicators that were used for the aggregation and clarified the reconciliation of assets belonging to the operating segments subject to the disclosure with all of the entity's assets only in cases where the disclosure is normally provided at the highest level of the entity's management ("CODM"); · with the amendment to IFRS 13, the IASB clarified that the goal of amendments to IAS 39 following publication of IFRS 13 was not to exclude the possibility to assess short-term receivables and payables without taking into account the effect of discounting, if the effect is not considered significant. Since the amendments to IFRS 13 refer only to the basis for conclusion, they were not approved by the European Union; · with the amendments to IAS 16 and to IAS 38, the IASB clarified how to apply the method to determine the values under the above standards; · with the amendment to IAS 24, the IASB extended the definition of "related party" to management companies. The adoption of these interpretations and standards did not and will not have any material impact on the valuation of the Group's assets, liabilities, costs and revenues. The table below shows the IFRS and interpretations approved by IASB and approved for adoption by Europe, effective after 31 December 2016:
64

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The IASB finished the draft of the accounting standard on financial instruments and issued the complete version of IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments". The new rules under the standard: (i) amend the classification and measurement model for financial assets; (ii) introduce the concept of expected credit losses amongst the variables to be considered in the valuation and write-down of financial assets; (iii) amend regulations on hedge accounting. The amendments take effect for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" requires companies to recognise revenue at the moment control of the goods or services is transferred to customers at the amount of payment that would be expected in exchange for such goods or services. The new standard introduces a method following five steps to analyse transactions and to define recognition of revenues according to their timing and amount. The Exprivia Group started to evaluate the areas potentially impacted by the aforementioned new standards, in order to define how to correctly account for each of them. In consideration of the fact that this process is ongoing, it is still not possible to reliably estimate the impacts of the application of the above-mentioned standards, particularly in relation to IFRS 15. The table below shows the international accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing accounting standards and interpretations, which are specific provisions contained in the standards and interpretations approved by the IASB, which were not yet approved for approval in Europe at the date of this annual report:
With the new standard IFRS 16 "Leases", the IASB replaced the accounting rules under IAS 17, which were no longer suitable to represent leasing in the current economic context. The new accounting standard requires that all leasing contracts should be recognised in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities whether they are "finance" or "operating". IFRS 14 "Regulatory Deferral Accounts" concern rate regulated activities, i.e., segments subject to prices through regulations. With amendments to IFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements" and to IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures", the IASB resolved a conflict between these two standards concerning the accounting treatment applied in cases when an entity sells or transfers a controlled entity to another entity over which it exercises joint control (joint ventures) or significant influence ("associated entities"). Amendments to IAS 12 "Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses" clarifies how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. The amendments to IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers "Clarifications to IFRS 15" published by the IASB, aim to clarify some provisions and provide further simplifications, in order to reduce costs and complexity, for those applying the new standard for the first time.
65

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Amendments to IAS 7: disclosure initiative is targeted at making some amendments to the standard, also needed as a consequence of the amendments to IAS 1, to ensure consistency between international accounting standards. Amendments to IFRS 2: classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions specifies the method for accounting for deferred tax assets relating to debt instruments measured at fair value. Amendment to IFRS 4: applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 insurance contracts aims to address some issues deriving from the application IFRS 9 "financial instruments", before its future implementation. The IASB also published various amendments to the standards and an IFRIC interpretation, to further clarify some provisions of IFRS, such as: · "Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 cycle" which modifies IFRS 1, IFRS 12 and IAS 28; · IFRIC interpretation 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration and
· the amendment to IAS 40 "investment property: transfers of investment property", in force on 1 January 2018.
The Exprivia Group will adopt these new standards, amendments and interpretations according to the date of application required for each, and it will assess the potential impact when they are approved by the European Union.
CONSOLIDATION CRITERIA
The consolidation area includes the financial statements of the Holding Company Exprivia S.p.A. with those of the subsidiaries and associated companies, except for the shareholdings held for sale.
Companies considered subsidiaries are those where: voting rights, also potential, held by the Group enable achievement of a majority of votes in the ordinary shareholders' meeting of the company; control is obtained by virtue of any agreements between the shareholders or any particular statutory stipulations that give the Group the power to oversee the company; the Group controls a sufficient number of votes to exercise control in the ordinary shareholders' meeting of the company.
Subsidiaries are consolidated line-by-line in consolidated accounts starting from the date in which control is established and until the Group no longer holds such control. The book value of the interests in subsidiaries is eliminated from the accounts against the related shareholders' equity for the period, not including the profit or loss for the period. The share of shareholders' equity and profit or loss pertaining to minority interests is reported under the item "Minority Interests" in the Balance Sheet and under the item "Minority Shareholders" in the Income Sheet. The result of the comprehensive income statement for a subsidiary is attributed to minorities also when this means minority interests have a negative balance. Interests in associated companies are valued with the equity method. An entity is considered associated when the Group is able to participate in defining its operational and financial policies even if it is not controlled or subject to joint control. According to the equity method, interests in an associated company is carried at purchase cost and adjusted, up or down, by the variations in the associate's net assets for the amount pertaining to the Group. Goodwill pertaining to the associate is included in the book value of the interest, and it is not subject to amortisation. Transactions generating internal earnings between the Group and associates are eliminated by the percentage of Group ownership. Adjustments are made to the financial statements of companies valued with the equity method in order to make them compliant with the valuation policies adopted by the Group. All balances and transactions between consolidated entities, including profit not yet realised, are eliminated. Losses deriving from intercompany transactions and not yet realised are eliminated with the exception of cases where there is impairment of transferred assets. Third party profits and losses not yet realised and deriving from transactions with associated companies or joint ventures are eliminated in the amount pertaining to the Group. Transactions concerning acquisitions and disposal of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries are considered transactions with shareholders and therefore their effects are reported under shareholders' equity.
66

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES
All assets and liabilities of foreign companies in currency other than the Euro and that fall within the consolidation area are converted using the exchange rate at the reference date of the financial statements. Income and expenses are converted at the average exchange rate. The exchange differences arising from the application of this method are classified under shareholders' equity until disposal of the investment. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the average exchange rates were used to convert foreign subsidiary cash flows.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments generated by the acquisition of a foreign entity are recorded in the relevant currency and are converted using the exchange rate effective at the end of the accounting period.
The primary exchange rates used for conversion into euro of the financial statements of foreign companies for 31 December 2016 were as follows:
Transactions in foreign currency are initially converted into the reporting currency at the exchange rate applicable on the date of the transaction. At the end of the period in question the monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are converted into the reporting currency at the exchange rate applicable on the closing date. Exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency, valued at cost, are converted at the exchange rate applicable at the date of the transaction, whereas those measured at fair value are converted at the exchange rate applicable on the date the measurement is made.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Business combinations are recognised according to the purchase accounting method pursuant to IFRS 3. According to this method, the cost of a business combination is measured at fair value, calculated as the sum of the fair value of assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group at the date of acquisition and the equity instruments issued to the seller in exchange for control over the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs for the transaction are recognised in the income statement when incurred.
The cost of a business combination it compared to the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities found on purchase. Any positive difference between the purchase cost and the amount pertaining to the group of the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities found on purchase is recognised as goodwill. If the difference is negative it is charged directly to the Income Statement. If only a temporary initial book value of a business combination can be determined the initial value adjustments are carried within twelve months from the date of purchase. Amounts pertaining to third parties are carried according to the fair value of the net assets purchased. If a business combination is made over several phases with subsequent purchase of shares each phase is valued separately using the cost and information on fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of each transaction to determine the amount of any difference. When a subsequent purchase results in obtaining control of an entity the amount previously held is carried again according to the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date control is achieved. Any amounts payable by the buyer are recognised at fair value on the date of acquisition. Changes in the fair value of amounts payable and classed as assets or liabilities, as a financial instrument under IAS 39, are recognised in the Income Statement or in the schedule containing the other components of the comprehensive income statement. When the amount does not fall under IAS 39 it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. If the amount is classed under shareholders' equity its value is not redetermined and its subsequent regulation is accounted for under shareholders' equity. Goodwill is initially recognised at cost, i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount paid and the amount carried for minority interests with respect to the net assets acquired and liabilities undertaken by the
67

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Group. If the amount is lower than the fair value of the acquired investee company's net assets the difference is carried in the Income Statement.
The option to purchase a part of minority interests or the option to sell minority interests is taken into consideration when determining whether control has been acquired.
Additionally, if control is acquired the amounts related to minority call options are considered financial liabilities as provided for under IAS 32.
Accounting estimates used in preparing the financial statements
Preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting standards required the use of estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on other factors that are deemed reasonable with respect to the circumstances and knowledge available as at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may depart from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are revised constantly. The effects of revised estimates are recognised in the income statement for the period in which the estimates are revised. The estimates mainly concern: amounts allocated to provisions for bad or doubtful debts, made according to the expected sale value of related assets; amounts allocated to provisions for risks, made according to the reasonable estimate of the amount of the potential liability, also with respect to any demands from the counterparty; amounts allocated for employee benefits, recognised according to actuarial valuations; amortisation/depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, recognised according to their remaining useful life and their recoverable value; income taxes, determined according to the best estimate applying the current rate for the financial year; development costs, initial capitalisation for which is based on the technical and financial feasibility of the project (future cash flow projections are made for each project).
The Group conducts impairment tests on goodwill at least once per year. For such tests an estimate is made on the value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill pertains. This estimate requires a projection of future cash flows and the estimate of the discount rate after tax, which reflects the market conditions at the date of the assessment.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND VALUATION POLICIES
The accounting standards adopted for drawing up the consolidated financial statements are the same as those adopted for drawing up the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the financial year which closed as at 31 December 2015.
The financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS. IFRS is intended as the International Accounting Standards (IAS) now in force, as well as all the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") formerly called the Standing Interpretations Committee ("SIC"), and in accordance with the regulatory provisions issued to implement art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/2005 (CONSOB Resolution no. 15519 of 27 July 2006 providing the "Rules for financial statement schedules", CONSOB Resolution no. 15520 of 27 July 2006 providing the "Changes and amendments to the Issuer Regulations adopted under Resolution no. 11971/99", CONSOB notice no. 6064293 of 28 July 2006 providing rules for "Company disclosure pursuant to art. 114(5), Italian Legislative Decree 58/98").
PROPERTY, PLANT AND MACHINERY
Property, plant and machinery are recognised at the cost of acquisition or production. The cost of acquisition or production is the price paid to acquire or build the business and any other cost incurred to prepare the asset for use. The price paid to acquire or produce the asset is the cash price equivalent at the time of accounting; therefore, if payment is deferred beyond normal credit extension terms, the difference with respect to the equivalent cash price is recorded as interest for the extension period. The financial
68

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016

charges incurred for the acquisition or production of the asset are never capitalised. The capitalisation of costs relating to the expansion, modernisation or improvement of leased assets is done only in so far as they satisfy the requirements for being classified as an asset or part of an asset.
After initial recognition, plant, machinery and other assets are entered at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The depreciated value of each significant component of a tangible asset, with a different useful life, is amortised by the straight-line method over the expected period of use. Considering the homogeneity of the assets included in the individual categories of the financial statements, it is assumed that the useful life per category of assets is the following (with the exception of certain significant cases):

Land Buildings Plant and Machinery Office Furnishings and Electronic Equipment Equipment and Vehicles

indefinite useful life 33 years 4 ­ 7 years 5 ­ 8 years 4 - 7 years

Land, including pertaining to buildings, is accounted for separately and not depreciated as it is a component with indefinite useful life.

The amortisation criteria used, the useful life and residual value are reviewed at the end of each accounting period and, if necessary, redefined to take into account any significant changes.

Industrial buildings are carried at a value periodically reassessed at market value less depreciation and impairment (revaluation model). As set forth by IAS 16, the company measures fair value and then remeasures it only when there is a significant difference with respect to the book value.
Costs that can be capitalised for improvements to leased assets are attributed to the classes of fixed assets to which they refer and depreciated for the shorter time between the remaining period on the lease agreement and the remaining useful life of the asset to which the improvement was made.
The book value of property, plant and machinery is maintained in the financial statements to the extent that such value can be recovered through use. If significant factors are noticed, which include the likelihood of recovering the net carrying amount, an impairment test is performed to determine any loss of value. A reversal is applied if the conditions at the basis of the impairment no longer apply.

GOODWILL
Goodwill is recognised based on the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3, as described in the section on business combinations, is not amortised but is subject to impairment tests at least once a year. To this end these values are allocated to one or more cash generating units starting on the acquisition date or by the end of the financial year.
If goodwill was allocated to a cash generating unit and the entity disposes of an asset that belongs to that unit then the goodwill associated to the asset is included in the book value of the asset when determining the gain or loss from the disposal. This amount is determined according to the values of the assets disposed of and the part kept.

69

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets, which include development costs, patent rights and use of intellectual property, concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights and software, are recognised as assets only if all the conditions laid down in IAS 38 are met (cost can be measured reliably, technical feasibility of product, the asset can be identified or separated, the Group controls the asset, or it has the power receive its future economic benefit, expected volume and price indicate that the costs incurred during development will generate future economic benefit) and valued at cost minus accumulated amortisation, determined on a straight-line basis over the period of expected use, on average, except for specific cases of 3-5 years, and any impairment. The amortisation criteria used, the useful life and residual value are reviewed at the end of each accounting period and, if necessary, redefined to take into account any significant changes. Costs for development projects are capitalised under the item "costs for capitalised internal projects" only when the development phase has ended and the product developed begins to generate economic benefit. They are subject to amortisation. During the period in which costs are incurred for capitalised internal development projects they are floated in the Income Statement as increases in fixed assets for internal work and classed under "costs for capitalised internal projects".
LEASING
Machinery owned through financial leasing contracts, for which the group has substantially assumed the risks and benefits which would arise from ownership, are recognised as assets on the basis of the criteria indicated by IAS 17. They are depreciated according to estimated useful life.
Leasing agreements where the lessor substantially keeps all risks and benefits of ownership are considered as operating leasing. The costs for leasing are carried in consistent amounts in the Income Statement for the duration of the agreement. The amount payable to the lessor is included in the other financial liabilities.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants are reported in the presence of a formal resolution and are accounted for as income in the financial year when related costs are incurred. Grants received against specific assets whose value is carried under fixed assets are entered in the income statement in relation to the period of amortisation/depreciation for the assets to which they refer. Advances received for terminated projects, for which a closing report has yet to be issued, have been classified as deductions from receivables. For ongoing projects, advances remain accounted for under liabilities.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
Impairment occurs every time the book value of an asset is greater than its recoverable value. The existence of any indicators suggesting impairment is checked at every balance sheet date. If those indicators are found the recoverable value of the asset is estimated (impairment test) and a write-down is recognised where necessary. Regardless of the existence of the indicators, an impairment test is carried out at least once a year for the assets not yet available for use and for goodwill. The recoverable value of an asset is the greater between its fair value, net of sale costs, and its use value. The recoverable value is calculated with reference to a single asset, unless it is unable to generate incoming cash flow from continued use notably independent of the incoming cash flows generated by other assets or
70

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
groups of assets, in which case the test is carried out for the smallest unit generating independent flows which include the asset in question (Cash Generating Unit).
When the write-down has no reason to be maintained, the book value of the asset (or cash generating unit), except for goodwill, is increased to the new value obtained from its estimated recovery value, in any case not over the net carrying amount that the assets would have had if the write-down due to impairment had not been made. The restored value is charged to the income statement, unless the asset is measured at the re-valued figure; in this case the recovered value is posted under the revaluation reserve.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Investments in other companies constituting financial assets available for sale are measured at fair value, if determinable, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are attributed directly to other comprehensive profit/(loss) until they are sold or are impaired; at that time, the Other comprehensive profit/(loss) previously recognised under net equity are recognised in the income statement of the period. Investments in other companies for which the fair value is unavailable are carried at cost, less any impairment.
Dividends received from these companies are included under the item financial income and charges and other investments.
All the other financial assets are classified into the following categories:
o Financial assets at fair value offset in the Income Statement: financial assets mainly acquired with the intention of making a profit from short-term price fluctuations (a period not longer than three months) or designated as such from the start;
o Financial assets held to maturity: investments in financial assets with preset maturity and fixed payments or determinable payments that the Group has the intention and capability to maintain through to maturity;
o Loans and other financial receivables: financial assets with payments that are fixed or can be decided, not listed on an active market and different from those originally classified as financial assets at fair value and offset in the income statement or as financial assets available for sale;
o Financial assets available for sale: financial assets other than those in the above categories or those designated as such from the start.
The Group classifies financial assets at the date of acquisition and accounts for them at fair value at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, the financial assets at fair value offset in the income statement and assets available for sale (where there is no "active" market) are measured at fair value, financial assets held to maturity and as well as loans and other financial receivables are valued at amortised cost.
Profit and loss arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value offset in the income statement is recognised in the income statement of financial year in which they occur. Unrealised profit and loss arising from changes in the fair value of assets classified as available for sale are carried under net equity.
The fair value of financial assets is determined on the basis of their market prices or by using financial models. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is measured using special assessment techniques adapted to the specific context of the Company. Financial assets for which the current value cannot be determined in a reliable manner are accounted for at a lower cost due to impairment.
The existence of any impairment indicators is checked at each balance sheet date. Write-downs in the income statement and under net equity reflect the valuation policies for financial assets. The impairment
71

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
previously accounted for is eliminated whenever the circumstances leading to the write-down no longer apply, with the exception of assets valued at cost.
Loans, payables and other financial and/or trade liabilities with preset or definable maturity are initially carried at their fair value, not including costs incurred for assuming the amounts payable. The valuation policy applied following initial recognition is the amortisation cost using the effective interest rate method. Long-term loans without an interest rate are accounted for by discounting future cash flows at the market rate if the increase in amounts is due to the passing of time. Amounts for interest are then carried in the income statement under the item "net financial income and charges". Financial payables are cancelled when the obligation underlying the payable is extinguished, voided or settled.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are recognised at the lesser value between the purchase price, determined in accordance with the specific cost, and the net sales price. The cost is the fair value of the price paid and any other cost directly attributable with the exception of financial charges. The net sales value is the estimated sales price net of costs for completion and sales. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent financial years if the reasons for the write-down no longer apply.
CONTRACT WORK IN PROGRESS
Work in progress is recognised according to the state of progress or percentage of completion so that costs, revenue and margin are carried according to the state of progress determined by referring to the ratio between costs incurred at the date of valuation and total expected cost. The valuation reflects the best estimate of programmes carried out at the balance sheet date. The estimates are updated periodically. Any economic effects are accounted for in the financial year in which the updates are made. If completed contract work is expected to result in a loss this is recognised entirely in the financial year in which it is reasonably forecast. Contract work in progress is carried without including any write-down provisions, losses on contract completion, or payments on account and advances for the contract being executed. This analysis is performed on a contract by contract basis. Whenever the difference is positive for work in progress higher than the amount of payments on account then it is classified under assets in the item in question. Whenever this difference is negative the amount is classified under liabilities in the item "advance payment for contract work in progress".
CASH AT BANK AND ON HAND
Cash at bank and on hand consists of short-term investments (generally not exceeding three months), easily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are carried at fair value. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, liquid assets are made up of cash, demand deposits at banks, short-term, highly liquid financial assets (original maturity not exceeding three months), and overdraft facilities. Current account overdrafts are carried under current financial liabilities.

OWN SHARES
Own Shares Own shares are reported in reduction of share capital. No profit (loss) is recognised in the Income statement for the acquisition, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Short-term benefits Short-term benefits for employees are accounted for in the income statement in the period in which the work was performed.
Defined benefit plans The Group grants its employees benefits under the Employee Severance Indemnity Fund (TFR). The employee severance indemnity accrued as at 31 December 2006 is considered a defined benefit to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. These benefits fall under the definition: defined benefit plan determined in existence and amount but uncertain in when payable. The total amount of the obligation is calculated on a yearly basis by an external actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses are fully accounted for in the related financial year. Recognition of the changes in actuarial gain/loss is carried amongst the comprehensive income statement components after the revised version of IAS 19 (Employee benefits) was adopted.
Defined contribution plans The Group takes part in public or private pension plans with defined contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Payment of the contributions fulfils the Group's obligation towards its employees. Thus, such contributions form an expense for the period in which they are due. The employee severance indemnity accrued after 31 December 2006 is considered a defined contribution obligation.
STOCK OPTIONS Share-based payments are measured at fair value on the date they are assigned. This value is charged to the income statement and offset under shareholders' equity over the entire period in which the entitlement accrues. The fair value of the options, calculated on the date of assignment, is measured by using financial mathematical models and taking into consideration the basic terms and conditions under which the entitlement is assigned. The Group plan concluded in 2011 and the related reserve was classified under other provisions.
POTENTIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Potential assets and liabilities of an unlikely (but possible) or remote nature are not recognised in the financial statements; nevertheless, adequate information is given concerning possible potential assets and liabilities. Whenever there is any financial disbursement relating to the obligation, and it occurs after the normal payment terms and the effect of discounting back is significant, the amount set aside corresponds to the current value of future payments expected to cancel the obligation.
73

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES
Provisions for risks and charges are probable liabilities of an uncertain amount and/or due date deriving from past events whose fulfilment will entail the use of economic resources. The amounts are only set aside if there is a current, legal or contractual obligation which makes the use of economic resources necessary, provided a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. The amount recognised is the best estimate of the expense to fulfil the obligation as at the balance sheet date. Provisions set aside are reviewed at every balance sheet date and adjusted to ensure they are the best current estimate.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Derivative contracts were recognised according to the designation the derivative instruments (speculative or hedging) and the nature of the risk covered (Fair Value Hedge or Cash Flow Hedge). For contracts designated as speculative, any changes in fair value are directly recognised in the income statement. In hedging contracts Fair Value Hedge is accounted for by recognising any changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the instrument hedged. If it is identified as Cash Flow Hedge, it is accounted for by floating the fair value portion of change of the hedging instrument, which is recognised as effective cover in the net equity, and charging the ineffective portion to the Income statement. The changes recognised directly under net equity are released in the income statement in the same reporting period or periods in which the asset or liability hedged influences the income statement.
ASSET TRANSFERS
The assets transferred by way of factoring transactions, which comply with the requirements established by IAS 39, are derecognised from the balance sheet.
REVENUE AND EXPENSES
Revenues arising from the assignment of assets are recognised when risk is transferred, which usually occurs on despatch, at the fair value of payment received or due while taking into account any discounts. Revenues arising from the provision of services are defined according to the percentage of completion, determined as the proportion of services performed at the date of reference and the total value of the services remaining to be performed. Expenses are recognised with the same criteria used to recognise revenue recognition and, in any case, on an accruals basis.
FINANCIAL INCOME AND CHARGES
Payable/receivable interest is recognised as financial income/charges after being checked on an accruals basis.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders hold the right to receive them, in accordance with local legislation.
74

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
TAXES
Taxes during the reporting period are defined on the basis of amounts expected to be due according to the tax laws in force. In addition, deferred taxes and those paid in advance are recognised on the temporary differences between the values carried in the financial statements and the corresponding values recognised for tax purposes, and showing accumulated tax losses or unused tax credits, provided it is probable that the recovery (discharge) reduces (increases) future tax payments with respect to those that would have occurred if that recovery (discharge) had not had any tax effect. The tax effects of transactions or other events are recognised in the income statement or directly under net equity using the same methods used to recognise transactions or events that result in taxation.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Holding Company by the average number of ordinary shares in circulation during the period. For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the economic result for the period minus the amount attributable to minority interests was used in the numerator. Further, there are no privileged dividends, conversion of privileged shares and other similar effects which could adjust the economic result attributable to holders of ordinary capital instruments. The diluted earnings per share is equal to the earnings per share adjusted to take into account the theoretical conversion of all potential shares.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The Group's financial statements are presented in Euros, the Group's functional currency. Transactions in foreign currency are converted into the reporting currency at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses on exchanges arising from liquidation related to these transactions and the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities into foreign currency are recognised in the income statement.
Financial risk management
The Exprivia Group is exposed to the following financial risks:
INTEREST RATE RISK
Over the years Exprivia group has obtained various loans including several medium-long term at a fixed rate and others at a facilitated rate, the latter relating to funded research and development projects. Concerning variable rate loans, where considered necessary the Group stipulates interest rate swap agreements or cap agreements to hedge the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Changes in interest rates during the financial year did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
CREDIT RISK
Exprivia group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk except for work carried out in the Public Administration sector, where delays are recorded mainly due to the payment policies adopted by
75

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
public bodies. They often do not respect the conditions set forth in contracts but, nevertheless, they do not lead to the risk of bad debts. The group also manages this risk by selecting counterparts considered to be solvent by the market and with high credit standing. All amounts receivable are periodically assessed for each individual customer, and they are written down when they are considered impaired. Risk for the Group is mainly related to trade receivables.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Prudent management of liquidity risk is pursued by planning cash flows, financing needs and the liquidity of the Exprivia group to ensure effective management of financial resources by managing any surplus liquidity, and by opening credit lines where necessary, including short-term ones. As a result of this management, while taking into accoiunt liquidity from loans and credit lines already in place and cash flows the Group is able to generate, risks related to liquidity (at least in the short term) are considered insignificant.
EXCHANGE RATE RISK
Since the majority of operations conducted by the Exprivia group is in the Euro area there is limited exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions that are not in the usual currency (Euro). Opening up to markets characterised by major fluctuations (e.g., Brazil) might constitute a risk to be monitored, depending, however, on the volumes in place, which for the moment are not significant. Fluctuating exchange rates during the financial year did not have a significant effect on the Group. The table below provides a reconciliation between financial assets and liabilities included in the schedule for the Group balance sheet and classes of financial assets and liabilities provided by IFRS 7 (amounts in millions of euro):
76

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
It should be noted that the financial instruments reported above, with reference to loans, receivables, payables and investments were measured at book value, given considered to be an approximation of their fair value. Derivative financial instruments are measured at level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY MEASUREMENT
Concerning financial instruments carried in the balance sheet at fair value, IFRS 7 requires that these values be classified according to a hierarchy reflecting the significance of input used in determining fair value. There are three levels as follows:
 Level 1 - quoted prices on an active market for similar assets or liabilities;  Level 2 - inputs other than the quoted prices in level 1, which are directly observable (prices) or
indirectly observable on the market;  Level 3 - inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Scope of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2016 include the equity, economic and financial situations of the Holding Company Exprivia S.p.A. and the subsidiaries, and changed with respect to 31 December 2015 as the companies ProSap Holding Inc and ProSap Consulting LLC, held directly by Profesionales de Sistemas Aplicaciones y Productos Sl, have closed. In addition, it should be noted that the company Exprivia SLU (formerly Profesionales de Sistemas Aplicaciones y Productos SL) incorporated the company Exprivia SL, with no impact on the consolidated financial statements. It should be pointed out that, in relation to the ACS Srl investment, in 2016 Exprivia acquired a stake of 83.8% (it already owned a stake of 16.2%), becoming the company's sole shareholder. Control of ACS Srl was acquired on 5 July 2016, following the sole shareholder's appointment of the administration and control bodies and, for this reason, was consolidated from July 2016. It should also be noted that the newly formed company Exprivia Process Outsoursing Srl was included in the scope of consolidation from November 2016. The table below shows the companies subject to consolidation; note that the investments shown below are all controlled directly by the Holding Company Exprivia apart from the companies ProSap SA de CV, ProSap Centroamerica SA, ProSap Perù Sac, Sucursal Ecuador de Exprivia SLU, Advances Computer Systems D Gmbh, Exprivia It Solutions (Shanghai) Co Ltd, which are controlled indirectly:
78

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The main data on the aforementioned subsidiaries consolidated using the line-by-line method are provided below (as at 31 December 2016).
The primary exchange rates used for conversion into euro of the financial statements of foreign companies for 31.12.16 were as follows:
Transactions in foreign currency are initially converted into the reporting currency at the exchange rate applicable on the date of the transaction. At the end of the period in question, the monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are converted into the reporting currency at the exchange rate applicable on the closing date. Exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency, valued at cost, are converted at the exchange rate applicable at the date of the transaction, whereas those measured at fair value are converted at the exchange rate applicable on the date the measurement is made.
SEGMENT REPORTING
It should be noted that, for some other business lines, the name was translated into English, to make it easier for an international audience to understand which activities are carried out by each BU. In accordance with the qualitative and quantitative factors provided by IFRS 8, the Group identified the following operating segments:
 Banking & Finance  Energy & Utilities  Industry  Oil & Gas
79

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016

Explanatory notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
All the figures reported in the tables below are in euro, unless expressly indicated.
NON-CURRENT ASSETS
1 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND MACHINERY
The item "property, plant and equipment" amounted to Euro 16,041,232 as at 31 December 2016 compared to Euro 13,796,812 at 31 December 2015.
The increase in the item "other", equal to Euro 536,780, is mainly due to the purchases of electronic office equipment (Euro 279,479), furniture and furnishings (Euro 111,921), mobile telephony devices (Euro 75,410) and leased assets (Euro 46,160). The decreases relate primarily to the transfer of assets to important customers in the Energy & Utilities and Healthcare sectors, in relation to the conclusion of contracts as a result of which contractual provision was made for the acquisition of the aforementioned assets by said customers. The item "change in the scope of consolidation" relates to the contribution of the fixed assets of the company ACS Srl, which joined the scope of consolidation on 1 July 2016. Note that ACS Srl owns the building which houses the registered office, as already report in the section of the Report "Investments". Please note that there is a first mortgage on the real estate complex located in Molfetta (BA) at Via Olivetti 11 for a maximum amount of Euro 50 million to guarantee the precise fulfilment of obligations arising from the Euro 25 million loan taken out on 1 April 2016 from a pool of banks (for additional details, please see note 16). In relation to leased items, the net book value amounts to Euro 1,667,706 and is attributable to electronic office machines for Euro 62,837, furniture and fittings for Euro 386,684 and land and buildings for Euro 1,218,184 (relating to the property owned by the company ACS Srl). It should also be noted that minimum future payments within one year amount to Euro 184,114, while those due in one to five years amount to Euro 698,021.
2 - GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE
The item "goodwill and other assets with an indefinite useful life" amounted to Euro 67,428,110 as at 31 December 2016 compared to Euro 67,118,492 at 31 December 2015.
81

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The variation is mainly attributable to the goodwill generated by the consolidation of ACS Srl. It should be noted that, as required by IFRS 3, the aforementioned business combination was not accounted for definitively as the analysis of the assets and liabilities of the company whose control was acquired in July 2016 is at the completion phase. Therefore, goodwill was recorded provisionally. Goodwill was generated in the business combinations made in previous financial years as a result of the Group's growth from acquiring companies operating in the same market.
INFORMATION RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED ON GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE: IMPAIRMENT TEST
Scope Accounting standard IAS 36 requires that impairment tests should be performed on tangible and intangible assets in the presence of indicators which suggest that this problem could exist. In the case of goodwill, as well as all other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such impairment tests should be performed on a yearly basis or more frequently in the case of special negative events that might result in impairment. Identification of Cash Generating Units (CGUs) and allocation of goodwil It does not represent goodwill, on the basis of international accounting standards, as a separate activity because it is incapable of generating cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. It can not be subject to impairment tests separately from the assets To which it is bound.For these purposes goodwill must be allocated to a CGU or CGU group, subject to the maximum aggregation constraint coinciding with the notion of asset segment referred to in Ifrs 8. As regards the Exprivia Group, goodwill has been allocated to the reference CGUs as follows:
 goodwill arising as a result of business combinations through which assets acquired from an operational point of view in specific CGUs were acquired have been allocated to their respective CGUs;
 goodwill arising from business combinations through which assets that are not specifically related to individual CGUs have been acquired have been attributed to the various CGUs in proportion to sales volumes produced during the year in which the first CGU was executed, allocation of goodwill;
 Goodwill allocated as described above has been reallocated following internal reorganization consistent with the same allocation criteria as stated in previous paragraphs.
The following table summarizes the allocation of goodwill to the identified CGUs:
82

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The CGU Energy refers to the operating segment Energy & Utilities, whereas the CGUs in Spain, Mexico, Guatemala and Exprivia Do Brasil refer to the International Division. Impairment Test Process and Assessment System The recoverability of the amount of goodwill carried in the financial statements is checked by comparing the book value allocated to each CGU and the recoverable amount in the definition of value of use. At the date of analysis, the latter is identified as the current value of future cash flow expected to be generated by the CGUs. The "DCF - Discounted Cash Flow" model was used in determining the value of use. The DCF discounts estimated future cash flow by applying an appropriate discount rate. The Waccs (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) used to discount cash flows were determined in the basis of the following specific parameters by country:
(1) Italy: BTP (multi-year treasury bond) Gross 10Y at 31.12.2016 Spain: Government Bond Gross 10Y at 31.12.2016 Brazil: Government Bond Gross US 10Y at 31.12.2016 Hong Kong: Government Bond Gross US 10Y at 31.12.2016
Source: Bloomberg 1 Y average
Identification of Cash Flows For the purpose of the projections required by IAS 36, strict reference was made to the current condition of use of each CGU regardless of the cash flow from any investment plans and extraordinary transactions that may constitute a "break" from normal company operations. The operating cash flow projections for the explicit 5-year period used for value measurement purposes are based on the budget and the plans subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
83

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The main economic-financial assumptions underlying the 2017-2021 financial forecasts are listed below: - for 2017 the projections reflect budget data from the year - for 2018-2021 the projections reflect an annual compound average growth rate of 4% and average profit margin of 10.9%
For some CGUs, the assumptions underlying the forecasts deviate from the basic ones reported above, in order to reflect certain unique characteristics of the specific sector, in particular:
- For the Healthcare and Health CGU, the projections for the years 2018-2021 reflect a compound annual growth rate of 10% justified by the reasonable assumption that significant tenders will be awarded.
- For the Spain CGU, the projections for the years 2018-2021 reflect a compound annual growth rate of 8%, justified by the expected effects of the organisational changes of company management and of the reference commercial structure.
The terminal value was calculated as the present value of the perpetuity obtained by capitalising the cash flow generated in the last analytical forecast period at a 1.2% G growth factor. Sensitivity Analysis A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the outcome of impairment tests assuming the following changes:
 a 0.5% increase in the weighted average cost of capital;  a 0.2% decrease in the growth rate "G"; The sensitivity analysis showed that the values in use are, in any case, higher than the book values, except for the Healthcare and Health and Spain CGUs, for which the change in parameters would highlight impairment of around Euro 4 million and Euro 0.4 million respectively. Conclusions The tests performed did not show any impairment that should be reported in the financial statements. In consideration of the increase in synergies between the different CGUs and the greater tendency of the company to plan and monitor business results from a group perspective, it is weighing up the opportunity to move to a simplified CGU model that is more representative of the company's current situation.
3 - OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The item Other intangible assets amounted to Euro 11,615,640 as at 31 December 2016 (net of amortisation) compared to Euro 4,190,565 at 31 December 2015. The table below provides a summary of the item.
84

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The increase in the item "costs for capitalised internal projects" is attributable primarily to the creation of software applications in the Banking & Finance, Healthcare and Aerospace & Defence areas (the latter sector pertaining to the company ACS Srl as a result of its inclusion in the scope of consolidation as of 01.07.2016). The item "work in progress", amounting to Euro 3,314,652, is attributable to the company ACS Srl and refers to the internal development contracts in the process of being completed. It should be noted that the item "work in progress" was reclassified, for an amount of Euro 354,815, to the item `costs for capitalised internal projects' and, for Euro 2,220,406, to the item 'other intangible assets" as a result of the entry into production of the relevant projects. The item "change in scope of consolidation" refers to the value of intangible fixed assets contributed by the company ACS Srl as a result of its consolidation for a net book value of Euro 7,288,750 as at 31 December 2016. The decreases relate primarily to the transfer of assets to important customers in the Energy & Utilities and Healthcare sectors, in relation to the conclusion of contracts as a result of which contractual provision was made for the acquisition of the aforementioned assets by said customers.
4 - EQUITY INVESTMENTS
The item "equity investments" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 167,561 compared to Euro 896,195 at 31 December 2015. The composition of equity investments is described below. Equity investments in Other Companies The item "equity investments in other companies" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 167,561 compared to Euro 896,195 at 31 December 2015. The table below provides details on the items:
85

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The main change refers to the equity investment Advanced Computer Systems Srl (ACS Srl) as a result of the purchase of an additional stake of 83.8% which brought Exprivia's percentage ownership to 100%, and the line-by-line consolidation of the company in these consolidated financial statements. De facto control of ACS Srl was acquired on 5 July 2016, following the sole shareholder's appointment of the administration and control bodies.
5 - OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS
Receivables from Parent Companies The balance of the item "receivables from parent companies", amounting to Euro 2,596,910 as at 31 December 2016, compared to Euro 1,305,338 at 31 December 2015, refers to the receivable due to the holding company Exprivia from its parent company Abaco Innovazione SpA as a result of the loan
86

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
agreement stipulated by the parties in 2016. The loan, amounting to Euro 2,985,338, was disbursed in cash (Euro 1,680,000) and through the reclassification of payables outstanding as at 31 December 2015 (Euro 1,305,338). The term of the loan has been established as 7 equal deferred annual instalments. The first instalment of Euro 388,428 is due on 4 April 2017; the amount was reclassified to "receivables from parent companies" under "other current financial assets" (note 11). Other Receivables As at 31 December 2016, "Other receivables" amounted to Euro 209,659, compared to Euro 201,199 at 31 December 2015. The change is shown in the table below.
Derivative financial instruments The balance of the item "derivative financial instruments" amounted to Euro 34,568 as at 31 December 2016, and relates to the following derivative instruments:
It should be noted that the Holding company subscribed the financial instruments described above in order to neutralise the interest rate risk determined by an underlying variable interest rate loan (Euribor). These are cash flow hedges, measured at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result of the hedge effectiveness tests performed for these hedging instruments, the fair value changes were recognised in full in the income statement (Euro 39,232). The sensitivity analysis conducted on the change in the fair value of derivatives after a shift of 1% in the spot interest rates curve highlights that:
 upon a change of +1%, the fair value of derivatives would amount to around Euro 231 thousand;  upon a change of -1%, the fair value would be nil.
6 - NON-CURRENT TAX RECEIVABLES
The balance of the item "tax receivables" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 1,772,942 compared to Euro 1,716,806 at 31 December 2015 and includes amounts requested for the refund application relating to the deductibility of the IRAP tax calculated on staff costs, which generated a recovery of IRES tax. Similarly to previous years, the refunds for the years 2009 to 2011 are recognised in the item, while those relating to 2007 and 2008 were included in the item "current tax receivables".
87

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
7 - PREPAID TAXES
The item "prepaid taxes" amounted to Euro 2,943,418 as at 31 December 2016 compared to Euro 1,839,961 at 31 December 2015, and refers to taxes on temporary deductible changes or future tax benefits. Prepaid taxes are stated in the financial statements if there is reasonable certainty they will be recovered, and are measured on the basis of the ability to generate taxable income in future years.
CURRENT ASSETS
8 - TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHERS
Trade Receivables As at 31 December 2016, the item "trade receivables" amounted to Euro 59,422,457 (net of the bad debts provision) compared to Euro 58,097,533 at 31 December 2015. The following table provides details on the item as well as a comparison with 31 December 2015.
88

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Trade receivables, including the write-down provision, can be broken down as follows:
The value of invoices to be issued reflects the particular type of business in which Group companies operate so, although many contracts can be invoiced on a monthly basis, others must follow an authorisation process which does not necessarily end in the month of reference. The amount shown in the financial statements is the amount that had been accrued up until the close of the period and which will be invoiced in the following months. The table below shows a breakdown of receivables by date of maturity, net of invoices/credit notes to be issued and including receivables carried under the bad debts provision:
Other Receivables As at 31 December 2016, the item "other receivables" amounted to Euro 9,527,989 compared to Euro 7,947,205 at 31 December 2015. The table below shows movements that occurred.
The amounts receivable in relation to "government grants" refer to grants accrued and/or accounted for to date in relation to costs incurred. These entries will be brought to zero when the balance of the grants is collected following the final assessments made by the respective Ministries and Local Bodies. The receivables are carried net of the risk provision for any minor grants that might not be received. The item "expenses pertaining to future financial years" for Euro 2,914,895 mainly refers to maintenance costs for future reporting periods.
89

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Tax Receivables As at 31 December 2016 the item "tax receivables" amounted to Euro 2,796,038, compared to Euro 2,655,240 at 31 December 2015. The table below provides a breakdown.
The amounts required for application for the refund relating to the deductibility of the IRAP tax calculated on staff costs, which generated a recovery of IRES tax, are included in the item "tax receivables". The item shows the refunds for the years 2007 and 2008.
9 - INVENTORIES
"Inventories" amounted to Euro 1,019,248 as at 31 December 2016 compared to Euro 269,325 at 31 December 2015 and refer to software and hardware purchased and destined to be resold in future periods. The change compared to the previous year is mainly attributable to the contribution of the company ACS Srl.
10 ­ CONTRACT WORK IN PROGRESS
"Contract work in progress" amounted to Euro 15,652,180 as at 31 December 2016 compared to Euro 11,228,568 at 31 December 2015 and refers to the percentage of completion of contracts in progress pertaining to the reporting period. The variation relating to the "Aerospace & Defence, Public Sector" area is mainly attributable to the contribution of the company ACS Srl. The table below provides the breakdown by business sector.

20 - PROVISION FOR RISKS AND CHARGES
As at 31 December 2016, the "provision for risks and charges" amounted to Euro 1,068,718 compared to Euro 622,311 at 31 December 2015. The breakdown is shown in the table below:
The "provision for dispute risks" allocated in the previous year of Euro 100,000 was used due to the negative outcome of the judgment of the Council of State no. 5503/16 of 28/12/2016, which ruled definitively on the dispute for exclusion of the RTI (temporary association of companies) with confiscation of the security deposit previously paid by Exprivia SpA for itself and for the principal Exprivia Healthcare IT Srl. The "provision for tax dispute risks" amounting to Euro 700,000, refers to the company Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl. The phases of the dispute are outlined below, which stem from a tax audit performed in 2007 by the Inland Revenue Agency, Provincial Department of Piacenza on Exprivia Enterprise Consulting (hereinafter "EEC"), formerly WellNetwork SpA In the report on findings drafted following said audit and concerning the events that occurred prior to the acquisition by Exprivia, EEC was notified of alleged violations of VAT legislation, undeclared capital gains and irrelevant entertainment costs. In the wake of the results of the report on findings, the Inland Revenue Agency issued EEC with assessment notices relating to the 2004 and 2005 tax periods; in these notices, the Inland Revenue Agency confirmed the qualification of the purchase transactions forming the object of the report on findings as objectively non-existent, consequently notifying EEC of the deductibility of the relevant costs for direct tax purposes and deductibility of the related VAT. EEC challenged the 2004 and 2005 assessment notices before the Tax Commission of Piacenza which, at the hearing on 8/11/2011, combined the two appeals and, by means of judgment 55/01/12, filed on 31/08/2012, cancelled said notices, ruling out the possibility, regarding the matter in question, of said transactions being classified as objectively non-existent, unlike what was claimed by the Inland Revenue Agency, and also excluding said transactions from being considered non-existent from a subjective viewpoint. The Inland Revenue Agency served notice, on 18 February 2003, of an appeal against the aforementioned judgment before the Regional Tax Commission of Bologna, whose proceedings will be discussed on 12 May 2017.
100

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Based on the opinion of the legal representatives assisting the company, there is a possible risk of being the losing party; in consideration of the favourable outcome obtained at the first instance proceedings and the existence of well-founded defensive arguments, it was not deemed necessary to allocate any provision for risks.
On 27/10/2014, EEC received notification from the Inland Revenue Agency of Piacenza of a new assessment notice in relation to the aforementioned report on findings for the year 2006. By means of said assessment, the Inland Revenue Agency, despite recalling the contents of the report on findings, no longer contested the non-existence of the transaction from an objective viewpoint but rather a subjective standpoint, therefore disallowing EEC's deductibility of VAT connected with said transactions for an amount of Euro 2,052,896, in addition to sanctions totalling Euro 5,132,240. In relation to the assessment notice pertaining to 2006, on 16/04/2015, EEC filed an appeal (RG 119/2015); the Provincial Tax Commission of Piacenza, at the hearing on 21/09/2015 ordered the suspension of the executive effects of the assessment notice and set 14/12/2015 as the date for the hearing for discussing the merits of the case. On 15/02/2016, the Provincial Tax Commission of Piacenza filed judgment no. 28/02/2016, confirming the company as the losing party. On 6/06/2016, EEC filed an appeal to the Bologna Regional Tax Commission against judgment no. 28/02/2016. The Regional Tax Commission, under decree no. 759/2016 of 12/07/2016, upheld the application for suspension `inaudita altera parte' (without prior hearing of the other party) and called the council chambers for 27 September 2016 to discuss said request, in which the Bologna Regional Tax Commission definitively upheld the request for suspension of judgment no. 28/02/2016 on the assessment notice. The hearing for discussion was set for 19 January 2017.
Following the hearing, the Regional Tax Commission filed judgment no. 887/4/2017 on 7 March 2017, in which it rejected the appeal filed by EEC, with the subsequent confirmation of the VAT assessed while, as regards sanctionary profiles, the appeal judges partially upheld the conditional exemptions, recalculating and reducing the sanctions applied to the company.
The judgment therefore establishes a non-deductible amount of VAT of Euro 2,052,896 plus sanctions of Euro 4,105,738 and interest.
The company asked leading legal firms, who handled its defence, for an in-depth review of the judgment and of the sale contract in place with the previous company shareholder. The main results of the review of various legal and tax matters performed by Studio Legale e Tributario Maisto e Associati di Milano and Studio Legale Associato Clifford & Chance are reported below:
(i) there are valid grounds for challenging the appeal judgment at the Court of Cassation, and elements pertaining to its invalidity;
(ii) there are legal grounds for the concession, by the Bologna Regional Tax Commission, of the provision to suspend the enforcement of the appeal judgment;
(iii) there are no profiles of joint and several liability on the part of Exprivia SpA;
(iv) the company has a legitimate entitlement deriving from the contract for the purchase of WelNetwork (now Expriva Enterprise Consulting) to initiate the request for full compensation from the seller.
In relation to point (i) careful analysis of the judgment by the company's legal representatives led them to believe that there are valid reasons for supporting the company's position at the Court of Cassation, as well as objective elements which could determine the invalidity of the aforementioned appeal judgment. In light of the above, the following elements justifying the appeal at the Court of Cassation are represented:
a) Invalidity of the judgment due to signature irregularities pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure
b) Violation and false application of the principle of mandatory establishment of preventive crossexamination, pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
c) Violation and false application of art. 2697 of the Italian Civil Code regarding the burden of proof, pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
101

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
d) Violation and false application of art. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
e) Violation and false application of art. 2729 of the Italian Civil Code regarding the use of presumptions for decision-maker purposes pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
f) Violation and false application of art. 2729 of the Italian Civil Code regarding the use of presumptions for decision-maker purposes pursuant to art. 360, paragraph 1, no. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
As regards point (ii), it is believed that, pursuant to art. 62-bis of Italian Legislative Decree 546/1992, there are grounds for formulating and hopefully obtaining the request for the suspension of enforcement of the appeal judgment before the Bologna Regional Tax Commission. As regards point (iii), it should be noted that, during the year to which the dispute refers, the company was not included in the corporate scope of the Exprivia Group. Also the other provisions of joint and several liability sanctioned by the legislation do not apply in the case in point. In relation to point (iv), after having carefully analysed both the contract and the case law on the matter, the company is fully entitled to be able to recoup its losses from the seller due to the aforementioned event, as it is included in the guarantees given by the seller, and given that the company has taken all the steps in the contract as regards promptly communicating the progress of the event to the seller and having carried out all the necessary activities to correctly handle it. It should also be noted that the parent company Exprivia Spa asked legal firm Associato Clifford Chance for an opinion on the guarantees set forth in the purchase contract stipulated in due course for the purchase of EEC. This opinion confirms that Exprivia Spa is fully entitled to recoup its losses from the seller as regards the aforementioned event, given it is fully incorporated in the guarantees given by the seller. Supported by the above-mentioned reasons contained in the opinions from the various legal firms, considering that there is a possible risk of being the losing party, the Directors decided to allocate a provision of Euro 700,000 to cover expenses connected with having to implement the actions necessary to settle the aforementioned disputes and to protect the company's interests. The "provision for staff risks", amounting to Euro 252,743, fell by Euro 99,111 compared to 31 December 2015 due to the closing of some ongoing disputes with former employees of Group companies, which determined use of the provision for Euro 23,446 and release of the surplus for Euro 75,665. The "provision for other risks", amounting to Euro 115,975 as at 31 December 2016, fell to Euro 54,483 compared to 31 December 2015.

21 - EMPLOYEE PROVISIONS
Employee Severance Indemnity Fund The amounts for the employee severance indemnity accrued after 31 December 2006 were paid to the INPS pension fund and union pension funds. The remaining employee severance indemnity fund amounted to Euro 9,228,805 as at 31 December 2015 compared with Euro 10,230,522 as at 31 December 2014. The fund is net of amounts deposited. An actuarial assessment was performed on the liability in accordance with IAS 19 using the retrospective method, which requires recognition of actuarial gains/losses in the comprehensive income statement. The cost regarding service and the interest payable concerning the "time value" component in the actuarial calculations are still recognised in the income statement.
Some of the general criteria used for the projections are described below. In order to meet the need to make assessments based on all the information available a technical procedure was used known in the actuarial literature as MAGIS (actuarial method of years in operation on an individual basis and by means of random drawings). This method is a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation that makes it possible to develop projections of amounts payable for each employee while taking into account the demographic and salary data of each position without making aggregations and without introducing average values. To make the procedure possible, drawings are made for each employee year by year to determine elimination by death, invalidity and incapacity due to resignation or termination. Reliability is ensured by replicating the procedure a certain number of times until the results are stable. The calculations were made by the number of years necessary for all the workers currently employed are no longer in service. The projections were made on a closed group, meaning no new recruits were included. In accordance with IAS 19, actuarial valuations were carried out using the Projected Unit Credit Method. This method makes it possible to calculate employee severance indemnities accrued at a certain date based on actuarial assumptions, distributing the charge for all remaining years workers are employed. It is no longer an expense to be paid if the company winds up its business at the balance sheet date, but gradually provisioning the charge according to the remaining service period of employees. The method makes it possible to calculate certain demographic and financial variables at the date of assessment, especially charges relating to service already rendered by employees represented by the DBO ­ Defined Benefit Obligation (also called Past Service Liability). It is obtained by calculating the present value of amounts due to the worker (severance indemnities) arising from seniority gained at the date of assessment.
103

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
For the purpose of revaluation, the employee's termination indemnity is increased, excluding the portion accrued at the end of the period, by applying a fixed rate of 1.50% and 75% of the inflation rate recorded by the ASTAT In December of the previous year; On this revaluation are due 11%. The legislation also provides for the possibility of requiring a partial anticipation of the TFR accrued when the employment relationship is still in progress. In the calculations, the 17% annual tax on the revaluation of the TFR was taken into account

Report on the consolidated financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Exprivia Group, which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2016, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in shareholders' equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors' responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) drawn up pursuant to article 11 of Legislative Decree No. 39/10. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditor's professional judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exprivia Group as of 31 December 2016 and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Report on compliance with other laws and regulations Opinion on the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the report on operations and of certain information set out in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure We have performed the procedures required under auditing standard (SA Italia) No. 720B in order to express an opinion, as required by law, on the consistency of the report on operations and of the information set out in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure referred to in article 123-bis, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree No. 58/98, which are the responsibility of the directors of Exprivia SpA, with the consolidated financial statements of the Exprivia Group as of 31 December 2016. In our opinion, the report on operations and the information in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure mentioned above are consistent with the consolidated financial statements of the Exprivia Group as of 31 December 2016.

The reports of the Independent Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A (hereinafter also the "Independent Auditor") on the separate and consolidated financial statements, issued on 31 March 2017 in accordance with articles 14 and 16 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010, do not contain any irregularities and/or information requests and certify that the separate and consolidated financial statements were drafted clearly and in compliance with the regulations that govern their drafting and provide a true and fair view of the financial standing, result and cash flows of the company and of the Group for the year ended as at 31 December 2016. The reports mentioned above also certify that the directors' report and disclosures required under art. 123-bis, paragraph 1, letters c), d), f), l), and m) and paragraph 2, letter b) of T.U.F. provided in the corporate governance and ownership report are consistent with the year-end separate financial statements and consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Statutory Auditors reviewed the statement issued by the Independent Auditor, in accordance with art. 17 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010, on 24 March 2017, in which the auditor (i) certified that no circumstances were found that would jeopardise their independence or lead to

incompatibility as provided under articles 10 and 17 of Italian Legislative Decree 39/2010 and related regulatory provisions, (ii) stated that non-audit services were provided to the Company, also by its network.
5. No reports provided under art. 2408 of the Italian Civil Code were submitted during the year.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
FORM AND CONTENT OF SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introduction The separate financial statements for Exprivia SpA as at 31 December 2016 were prepared in accordance with art. 4 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38 of 28 February 2005 and the international accounting standards (IFRS) in force as at 31 December 2015, as well as all the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") formerly called the Standing Interpretations Committee ("SIC"), and in accordance with the regulatory provisions issued to implement art. 9 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 38/2005 (CONSOB Resolution no. 15519 of 27 July 2006 providing the "Rules for financial statement schedules", CONSOB Resolution no. 15520 of 27 July 2006 providing the "Changes and amendments to the Issuer Regulations adopted under Resolution no. 11971/99", CONSOB notice no. 6064293 of 28 July 2006 providing rules for "Company disclosure pursuant to art. 114(5), Italian Legislative Decree 58/98"). The schedules in the financial statements are the following:
o For the balance sheet the current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities are posted separately. Current assets are those that are to be made, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Company. Current liabilities are those that are to be extinguished during the normal operating cycle of the Company or within twelve months following the end of the financial year;
o For the income statement, the cost and revenue items are posted according to their nature; o For the comprehensive income statement, a separate schedule was prepared; o For the cash flow statement, the indirect method was used.
The schemes are prepared in accordance with IAS 1 and 7. The separate financial statements were prepared under the general policy of giving an accurate and truthful presentation of the Company's financial standing, economic result and cash flows, while adopting the going-concern assumption, and the general policies of accrual basis accounting, presentation coherence, relevance and aggregation, rule against offsetting and comparability of information.
Adjustments to comparative data
In order to make the disclosure of data more intelligible, the presentation was changed for certain items in the comparative data of the income statement presented in accordance with IAS 1, with respect to data published in the financial statements as at 31 December 2015. This had no effect on the result and net equity at that date. In particular, the balance as at 31 December 2015 of the item "Costs for services", presented for comparative purposes, increased compared to the data published in the financial statements as at 31 December 2015 by Euro 260 thousand (from Euro 18,350,514 to Euro 18,610,693) with reference to bank fees previously recognised under "Sundry operating expenses", the balance of which fell from Euro 589,775 to Euro 329,596.
Drafting and presentation criteria
The accounting policies and valuation criteria are those adopted to prepare the financial statements as at 31 December 2015.
The valuation and measurement policies are based on the IFRS standards in effect as at 31 December 2016 and approved by the European Union.
The following table contains the list of international accounting standards and interpretations approved
143

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
by the IASB and endorsed for adoption in Europe and applied for the first time to the current year.
The adoption of these standards did not have any material impact on the valuation of the Exprivia assets, liabilities, costs and revenues.
The amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 "Investment Entities", clarifies some aspects relating to investment entities. The amendments made to IFRS 10 confirm the exemption from the drafting of consolidated financial statements for an intermediate parent (that is not an investment entity) which is controlled by an investment entity. As regards IAS 28, the standard was amended in relation to investments held in associates or joint ventures that are "investment entities": these investments can be valued using the equity method or at fair value. The amendment to IAS 27 "Separate Financial Statements" introduced the option to account for investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures using the equity method, while previously IAS 27 required that they should be accounted for at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9 (IAS 39 for entities that did not adopt IFRS 9). The amendments to IAS 1 "Disclosure Initiative (amendments to IAS 1)", clarify certain aspects concerning the presentation of financial statements highlighting the emphasis on the importance of information (disclosures) in the financial statements, specifying that there is no longer a specific order for presenting explanatory notes and giving the possibility to group/ungroup items so that items considered as minimum content under IAS 1 can be grouped together when not considered significant. The 2012-2014 improvements cycle brought amendments to certain accounting standards, especially concerning certain aspects not considered clear. In particular, the amendments concerned: · lo IAS 19 "Employee benefits", where the IASB clarified that the discount rate for an obligation under a defined benefit plan should be determined on the basis of "high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds" identified in the same currency used to pay the benefits; · IFRS 7 "Financial instruments - disclosures": the IASB clarified that an entity transferring financial assets and derecognising them from its balance sheet is required to disclose any continuing involvement, where existing. In addition to the disclosures required by IFRS 7 concerning offsetting financial assets and liabilities this is required only for the annual report and provided in the interim financial statements only where deemed necessary; · IAS 34, where the IASB clarified that the disclosures required under this standard can be included in the notes to the interim financial statements, or they can be included in other documents (such as the risk reports), by providing references to them in the interim financial statements, as long as the users of the interim financial statements have access to the same conditions and timeframes as the interim financial statements.
144

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle also includes amendments to IFRS 5 "Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", which are currently not applicable to the Exprivia group. With the amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 38 "Property, Plant and Equipment", the IASB clarified that a depreciation process according to revenues cannot be applied for property, plant and equipment since this method is based on factors, for instance volumes and sale prices that do not represent the actual consumption of the economic benefits of the asset. IFRS 11 "Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations" clarifies how to account for the acquisition of interests in joint operations that constitute a business. Amendments to IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment" and to IAS 41 "Agriculture" concern accounting rules for fruit trees. The amendment to IAS 19 "Employee Benefits" concerns accounting for defined employee benefits plans that envisage contributions from third-parties or employees. The IFRS 2010-2012 annual improvements include minor amendments to several standards for sections that needed clarification. In brief: · with amendments to IFRS 2 "share-based payments", the IASB clarified the criteria and characteristics that a performance condition should meet; · with the amendment to IFRS 3 "Business Combinations", the IASB clarified aspects for the classification and valuation of contingent considerations; · with the amendment to IFRS 8 "Operating Segments", the IASB introduced a new disclosure requirement to include a brief description of the operating segments that were aggregated and the financial indicators that were used for the aggregation and clarified the reconciliation of assets belonging to the operating segments subject to the disclosure with all of the entity's assets only in cases where the disclosure is normally provided at the highest level of the entity's management ("CODM"); · with the amendment to IFRS 13, the IASB clarified that the goal of amendments to IAS 39 following publication of IFRS 13 was not to exclude the possibility to assess short-term receivables and payables without taking into account the effect of discounting, if the effect is not considered significant. Since the amendments to IFRS 13 refer only to the basis for conclusion, they were not approved by the European Union; · with the amendments to IAS 16 and to IAS 38, the IASB clarified how to apply the method to determine the values under the above standards; · with the amendment to IAS 24, the IASB extended the definition of "related party" to management companies. The adoption of these interpretations and standards did not and will not have any material impact on the valuation of the Group's assets, liabilities, costs and revenues. The table below shows the IFRS and interpretations approved by IASB and approved for adoption by Europe, effective after 31 December 2016:
The IASB finished the draft of the accounting standard on financial instruments and issued the complete version of IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments". The new rules under the standard: (i) amend the classification and measurement model for financial assets; (ii) introduce the concept of expected credit losses amongst the variables to be considered in the valuation and write-down of financial assets; (iii) amend regulations on hedge accounting. The amendments take effect for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018.
145

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" requires companies to recognise revenue at the moment control of the goods or services is transferred to customers at the amount of payment that would be expected in exchange for such goods or services. The new standard introduces a method following five steps to analyse transactions and to define recognition of revenues according to their timing and amount. The Exprivia Group started to evaluate the areas potentially impacted by the aforementioned new standards, in order to define how to correctly account for each of them. In consideration of the fact that this process is ongoing, it is still not possible to reliably estimate the impacts of the application of the above-mentioned standards, particularly in relation to IFRS 15. The table below shows the international accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing accounting standards and interpretations, which are specific provisions contained in the standards and interpretations approved by the IASB, which were not yet approved for approval in Europe at the date of this annual report:
With the new standard IFRS 16 "Leases", the IASB replaced the accounting rules under IAS 17, which were no longer suitable to represent leasing in the current economic context. The new accounting standard requires that all leasing contracts should be recognised in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities whether they are "finance" or "operating". IFRS 14 "Regulatory Deferral Accounts" concern rate regulated activities, i.e., segments subject to prices through regulations. With amendments to IFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements" and to IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures", the IASB resolved a conflict between these two standards concerning the accounting treatment applied in cases when an entity sells or transfers a controlled entity to another entity over which it exercises joint control (joint ventures) or significant influence ("associated entities"). Amendments to IAS 12 "Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses" clarifies how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. The amendments to IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers "Clarifications to IFRS 15" published by the IASB, aim to clarify some provisions and provide further simplifications, in order to reduce costs and complexity, for those applying the new standard for the first time. Amendments to IAS 7: disclosure initiative is targeted at making some amendments to the standard, also needed as a consequence of the amendments to IAS 1, to ensure consistency between international accounting standards. Amendments to IFRS 2: classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions specifies the method for accounting for deferred tax assets relating to debt instruments measured at fair value. Amendment to IFRS 4: applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 insurance contracts aims to address some issues deriving from the application IFRS 9 "financial instruments", before its future implementation. The IASB also published various amendments to the standards and an IFRIC interpretation, to further clarify some provisions of IFRS, such as:
146

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
· "Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 cycle" which modifies IFRS 1, IFRS 12 and IAS 28; · IFRIC interpretation 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration and
· the amendment to IAS 40 "investment property: transfers of investment property", in force on 1 January 2018.
The Exprivia Group will adopt these new standards, amendments and interpretations according to the date of application required for each, and it will assess the potential impact when they are approved by the European Union.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting standards required the use of estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on other factors that are deemed reasonable with respect to the circumstances and knowledge available as at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may depart from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are revised constantly. The effects of revised estimates are recognised in the income statement for the period in which the estimates are revised. The estimates mainly concern: amounts allocated to provisions for bad or doubtful debts, made according to the expected sale value of related assets; amounts allocated to provisions for risks, made according to the reasonable estimate of the amount of the potential liability, also with respect to any demands from the counterparty; amounts allocated for employee benefits, recognised according to actuarial valuations; amortisation/depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, recognised according to their remaining useful life and their recoverable value; income taxes, determined according to the best estimate of the rate expected for the entire financial year; development costs, initial capitalisation for which is based on the technical and financial feasibility of the project (future cash flow projections are made for each project). The Company conducts impairment tests on goodwill at least once per year. For such tests an estimate is made on the value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill pertains. This estimate requires a projection of future cash flows and the estimate of the discount rate after tax, which reflects the market conditions at the date of the assessment.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POLICIES
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these separate financial statements are consistent with those applied in preparing the separate financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015.
"IFRS" means International Accounting Standards (IAS) still in force, as well as al linterpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ( "IFRIC") formerly the Standing Interpretations Committee ( "SIC"), and in accordance with measures implementing art. 9 of Legislative Decree. N. 38/2005 (Consob Resolution no. 15519 of 27 July 2006 on "Measures for the presentation of financial statements", Consob Resolution no. 15520 of July 27, 2006 on "Amendments and additions to the Issuer Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 11971/99" Consob communication no. 6064293 of 28 July 2006 laying down "Disclosures required underart. 114, paragraph 5, Legislative Decree no. 58/98 ").
PROPERTY, PLANT AND MACHINERY
Property, plant and machinery are recognised at the cost of acquisition or production. The cost of acquisition or production is the price paid to acquire or build the business and any other cost incurred to prepare the asset for use. The price paid to acquire or produce the asset is the cash price equivalent at the time of accounting; therefore, if payment is deferred beyond normal credit extension terms, the difference with respect to the equivalent cash price is recorded as interest for the extension period. The financial charges incurred for the acquisition or production of the asset are never capitalised. The capitalisation of costs relating to the expansion, modernisation or improvement of leased assets is done only in so far as they satisfy the requirements for being classified as an asset or part of an asset.
147

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016

After initial recognition, plant, machinery and other assets are entered at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment. The depreciated value of each significant component of a tangible asset, with a different useful life, is amortised by the straight-line method over the expected period of use. Considering the homogeneity of the assets included in the individual categories of the financial statements, it is assumed that the useful life per category of assets is the following (with the exception of certain significant cases):

Land Buildings Plant and Machinery Office Furnishings and Electronic Equipment Equipment and Vehicles

indefinite useful life 33 years
4 ­ 7 years 5 ­ 8 years 4 - 7 years

Land, including pertaining to buildings, is accounted for separately and not depreciated as it is a component with indefinite useful life.

The amortisation criteria used, the useful life and residual value are reviewed at the end of each accounting period and, if necessary, redefined to take into account any significant changes.

Industrial buildings are carried at a value periodically reassessed at market value less depreciation and impairment (revaluation model). As set forth by IAS 16, the company measures fair value and then remeasures it only when there is a significant difference with respect to the book value.

Costs that can be capitalised for improvements to leased assets are attributed to the classes of fixed assets to which they refer and depreciated for the shorter time between the remaining period on the lease agreement and the remaining useful life of the asset to which the improvement was made.

The book value of property, plant and machinery is maintained in the financial statements to the extent that such value can be recovered through use. If significant factors are noticed, which include the likelihood of recovering the net carrying amount, an impairment test is performed to determine any loss of value. A reversal is applied if the conditions at the basis of the impairment no longer apply.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is recognized in the financial statements in relation to business combinations and is initially writing to the cost incurred, equal to the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is classified as intangible assets. Since the acquisition date, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each cash-generating units or groups of units generating financial flows. After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but valued at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. If goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an activity that is part of that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal; this share is determined based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the retained portion.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets, which include development costs, patent rights and use of intellectual property, concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights and software, are recognised as assets only if all the conditions laid down in IAS 38 are met (cost can be measured reliably, technical feasibility of product, the

148

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
asset can be identified or separated, the Company controls the asset, or it has the power receive its future economic benefit, expected volume and price indicate that the costs incurred during development will generate future economic benefit) and valued at cost minus accumulated amortisation, determined on a straight-line basis over the period of expected use, on average, except for specific cases of 3-5 years, and any impairment. The amortisation criteria used, the useful life and residual value are reviewed at the end of each accounting period and, if necessary, redefined to take into account any significant changes. Costs for development projects are capitalised under the item "costs for capitalised internal projects" only when the development phase has ended and the product developed begins to generate economic benefit. They are subject to amortisation. During the period in which costs are incurred for capitalised internal development projects they are floated in the Income Statement as increases in fixed assets for internal work and classed under "costs for capitalised internal projects".
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Equity investments are valued at purchase cost not including any impairment. If the reasons for applying write-downs no longer exist then the investments are revalued in the amount of the write-down itself. The option to purchase a part of minority interests or the option to sell minority interests is taken into consideration when determining whether control has been acquired. dditionally, if control is acquired the amounts related to minority call options are considered financial liabilities as provided for under IAS 32. Upon loss of significant influence on a related company or joint venture control of a joint venture, the company evaluates and recognizes the residual equity at fair value, the difference between the carrying value of the investment at the date of loss of influence Significant or joint control and the fair value of the residual participations and the amounts received are recognized in the income statement.
LEASING
Machinery owned through financial leasing contracts, for which the Company has substantially assumed the risks and benefits which would arise from ownership, are recognised as assets on the basis of the criteria indicated by IAS 17. They are depreciated according to estimated useful life. Leasing agreements where the lessor substantially keeps all risks and benefits of ownership are considered as operating leasing. The costs for leasing are carried in consistent amounts in the Income Statement for the duration of the agreement. The amount payable to the lessor is included in the other financial liabilities.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants are reported in the presence of a formal resolution and are accounted for as income in the financial year when related costs are incurred. Grants received against specific assets whose value is carried under fixed assets are entered in the income statement in relation to the period of amortisation/depreciation for the assets to which they refer. Advances received for terminated projects, for which a closing report has yet to be issued, have been classified as deductions from receivables. For ongoing projects, advances remain accounted for under liabilities.
149

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
Impairment occurs every time the book value of an asset is greater than its recoverable value. The existence of any indicators suggesting impairment is checked at every balance sheet date. If those indicators are found the recoverable value of the asset is estimated (impairment test) and a write-down is recognised where necessary. Regardless of the existence of the indicators, an impairment test is carried out at least once a year for the assets not yet available for use and for goodwill.
The recoverable value of an asset is the greater between its fair value, net of sale costs, and its use value. The recoverable value is calculated with reference to a single asset, unless it is unable to generate incoming cash flow from continued use notably independent of the incoming cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets, in which case the test is carried out for the smallest unit generating independent flows which include the asset in question (Cash Generating Unit).
When the write-down has no reason to be maintained, the book value of the asset (or cash generating unit), except for goodwill, is increased to the new value obtained from its estimated recovery value, in any case not over the net carrying amount that the assets would have had if the write-down due to impairment had not been made. The restored value is charged to the income statement, unless the asset is measured at the re-valued figure; in this case the recovered value is posted under the revaluation reserve.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Investments in other companies constituting financial assets available for sale are measured at fair value, if determinable, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are attributed directly to other comprehensive profit/(loss) until they are sold or are impaired; at that time, the Other comprehensive profit/(loss) previously recognised under net equity are recognised in the income statement of the period. Investments in other companies for which the fair value is unavailable are carried at cost, less any impairment.
Dividends received from these companies are included under the item financial income and charges and other investments.
All the other financial assets are classified into the following categories:
o Financial assets at fair value offset in the Income Statement: financial assets mainly acquired with the intention of making a profit from short-term price fluctuations (a period not longer than three months) or designated as such from the start;
o Financial assets held to maturity: investments in financial assets with preset maturity and fixed payments or determinable payments that the company has the intention and capability to maintain through to maturity;
o Loans and other financial receivables: financial assets with payments that are fixed or can be decided, not listed on an active market and different from those originally classified as financial assets at fair value and offset in the income statement or as financial assets available for sale;
o Financial assets available for sale: financial assets other than those in the above categories or those designated as such from the start.
The Company classifies financial assets at the date of acquisition and accounts for them at fair value at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, the financial assets at fair value offset in the income statement and assets available for sale (where there is no "active" market) are measured at fair value, financial assets held to maturity and as well as loans and other financial receivables are valued at amortised cost.

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Profit and loss arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value offset in the income statement is recognised in the income statement of financial year in which they occur. Unrealised profit and loss arising from changes in the fair value of assets classified as available for sale are carried under net equity. The fair value of financial assets is determined on the basis of their market prices or by using financial models. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is measured using special assessment techniques adapted to the specific context of the Company. Financial assets for which the current value cannot be determined in a reliable manner are accounted for at a lower cost due to impairment. The existence of any impairment indicators is checked at each balance sheet date. Write-downs in the income statement and under net equity reflect the valuation policies for financial assets. The impairment previously accounted for is eliminated whenever the circumstances leading to the write-down no longer apply, with the exception of assets valued at cost. Loans, payables and other financial and/or trade liabilities with preset or definable maturity are initially carried at their fair value, not including costs incurred for assuming the amounts payable. The valuation policy applied following initial recognition is the amortisation cost using the effective interest rate method. Long-term loans without an interest rate are accounted for by discounting future cash flows at the market rate if the increase in amounts is due to the passing of time. Amounts for interest are then carried in the income statement under the item "net financial income and charges". Financial payables are cancelled when the obligation underlying the payable is extinguished, voided or settled.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are recognised at the lesser value between the purchase price, determined in accordance with the specific cost, and the net sales price. The cost is the fair value of the price paid and any other cost directly attributable with the exception of financial charges. The net sales value is the estimated sales price net of costs for completion and sales. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent financial years if the reasons for the write-down no longer apply.
CONTRACT WORK IN PROGRESS
Work in progress is recognised according to the state of progress or percentage of completion so that costs, revenue and margin are carried according to the state of progress determined by referring to the ratio between costs incurred at the date of valuation and total expected cost. The valuation reflects the best estimate of programmes carried out at the balance sheet date. The estimates are updated periodically. Any economic effects are accounted for in the financial year in which the updates are made. If completed contract work is expected to result in a loss this is recognised entirely in the financial year in which it is reasonably forecast. Contract work in progress is carried without including any write-down provisions, losses on contract completion, or payments on account and advances for the contract being executed. This analysis is performed on a contract by contract basis. Whenever the difference is positive for work in progress higher than the amount of payments on account then it is classified under assets in the item in question. Whenever this difference is negative the amount is classified under liabilities in the item "advance payment for contract work in progress".

CASH AT BANK AND ON HAND
Cash at bank and on hand consists of short-term investments (generally not exceeding three months), easily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are carried at fair value. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, liquid assets are made up of cash, demand deposits at banks, short-term, highly liquid financial assets (original maturity not exceeding three months), and overdraft facilities. Current account overdrafts are carried under current financial liabilities.
OWN SHARES
Own Shares Own shares are reported in reduction of share capital. No profit (loss) is recognised in the Income statement for the acquisition, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Short-term benefits Short-term benefits for employees are accounted for in the income statement in the period in which the work was performed.
Defined benefit plans The Company grants its employees benefits under the Employee Severance Indemnity Fund (TFR). The employee severance indemnity accrued as at 31 December 2006 is considered a defined benefit to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. These benefits fall under the definition: defined benefit plan determined in existence and amount but uncertain in when payable. The total amount of the obligation is calculated on a yearly basis by an external actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses are fully accounted for in the related financial year. Recognition of the changes in actuarial gain/loss is carried amongst the comprehensive income statement components after the revised version of IAS 19 (Employee benefits) was adopted.
Defined contribution plans The Company takes part in public or private pension plans with defined contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Payment of the contributions fulfils the Company's obligation towards its employees. Thus, such contributions form an expense for the period in which they are due. The employee severance indemnity accrued after 31 December 2006 is considered a defined contribution obligation.
STOCK OPTIONS Share-based payments are measured at fair value on the date they are assigned. This value is charged to the income statement and offset under shareholders' equity over the entire period in which the entitlement accrues. The fair value of the options, calculated on the date of assignment, is measured by using financial mathematical models and taking into consideration the basic terms and conditions under which the entitlement is assigned. The Company plan concluded in 2011 and the related reserve was classified under other provisions.
152

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
POTENTIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Potential assets and liabilities of an unlikely (but possible) or remote nature are not recognised in the financial statements; nevertheless, adequate information is given concerning possible potential assets and liabilities. Whenever there is any financial disbursement relating to the obligation, and it occurs after the normal payment terms and the effect of discounting back is significant, the amount set aside corresponds to the current value of future payments expected to cancel the obligation.
PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES
Provisions for risks and charges are probable liabilities of an uncertain amount and/or due date deriving from past events whose fulfilment will entail the use of economic resources. The amounts are only set aside if there is a current, legal or contractual obligation which makes the use of economic resources necessary, provided a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. The amount recognised is the best estimate of the expense to fulfil the obligation as at the balance sheet date. Provisions set aside are reviewed at every balance sheet date and adjusted to ensure they are the best current estimate.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Derivative contracts were recognised according to the designation the derivative instruments (speculative or hedging) and the nature of the risk covered (Fair Value Hedge or Cash Flow Hedge). For contracts designated as speculative, any changes in fair value are directly recognised in the income statement. In hedging contracts Fair Value Hedge is accounted for by recognising any changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the instrument hedged. If it is identified as Cash Flow Hedge, it is accounted for by floating the fair value portion of change of the hedging instrument, which is recognised as effective cover in the net equity, and charging the ineffective portion to the Income statement. The changes recognised directly under net equity are released in the income statement in the same reporting period or periods in which the asset or liability hedged influences the income statement.
ASSET TRANSFERS
The assets transferred by way of factoring transactions, which comply with the requirements established by IAS 39, are derecognised from the balance sheet.
REVENUE AND EXPENSES
Revenues arising from the assignment of assets are recognised when risk is transferred, which usually occurs on despatch, at the fair value of payment received or due while taking into account any discounts. Revenues arising from the provision of services are defined according to the percentage of completion, determined as the proportion of services performed at the date of reference and the total value of the services remaining to be performed. Expenses are recognised with the same criteria used to recognise revenue recognition and, in any case, on an accruals basis.
153

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
FINANCIAL INCOME AND CHARGES
Payable/receivable interest is recognised as financial income/charges after being checked on an accruals basis.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders hold the right to receive them, in accordance with local legislation.
TAXES
Taxes during the reporting period are defined on the basis of amounts expected to be due according to the tax laws in force. In addition, deferred taxes and those paid in advance are recognised on the temporary differences between the values carried in the financial statements and the corresponding values recognised for tax purposes, and showing accumulated tax losses or unused tax credits, provided it is probable that the recovery (discharge) reduces (increases) future tax payments with respect to those that would have occurred if that recovery (discharge) had not had any tax effect. The tax effects of transactions or other events are recognised in the income statement or directly under net equity using the same methods used to recognise transactions or events that result in taxation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Transactions in foreign currency are converted into euro at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses on exchanges arising from liquidation related to these transactions and the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities into foreign currency are recognised in the income statement.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In accordance with the qualitative and quantitative factors provided by IFRS 8, the Company identified the following operating segments:
 Industry  Energy & Utilities  Oil & Gas  Defence, Aerospace and Public Administration
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Exprivia SpA is exposed to the following financial risks:
INTEREST RATE RISK
Over the years the Company has obtained various loans including several medium-long term at a fixed rate and others at a facilitated rate, the latter relating to funded research and development projects. Concerning variable rate loans, where considered necessary the Company stipulates interest rate swap agreements or cap agreements to hedge the risk of fluctuating interest rates.
154

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Changes in interest rates during the financial year did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
CREDIT RISK
The Company does not have significant concentrations of credit risk except for work carried out in the Public Administration sector, where delays are recorded mainly due to the payment policies adopted by public bodies. They often do not respect the conditions set forth in contracts but, nevertheless, they do not lead to the risk of bad debts. The Company also manages this risk by selecting counterparts considered to be solvent by the market and with high credit standing. All amounts receivable are periodically assessed for each individual customer, and they are written down when they are considered impaired. Risk for the Company is mainly related to trade receivables.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Prudent management of liquidity risk is pursued by planning cash flows, financing needs and the liquidity of the Company to ensure effective management of financial resources by managing any surplus liquidity, and by opening credit lines where necessary, including short-term ones. As a result of this management, while taking into account liquidity from loans and credit lines already in place and cash flows the Company is able to generate, risks related to liquidity (at least in the short term) are considered insignificant.
EXCHANGE RATE RISK
Since the majority of operations conducted by the Company is in the euro area there is limited exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions that are not in the usual currency (euro). Fluctuating exchange rates during the financial year did not have a significant effect on the Company. The table below provides a reconciliation between financial assets and liabilities included in the schedule for the Company balance sheet and classes of financial assets and liabilities provided by IFRS 7 (amounts in millions of euro):
155

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
It should be noted that the financial instruments reported above, with reference to loans, receivables, payables and investments were measured at book value, given considered to be an approximation of their fair value. Derivative financial instruments are measured at level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value Hierarchy Measurement Concerning financial instruments carried in the balance sheet at fair value, IFRS 7 requires that these values be classified according to a hierarchy reflecting the significance of input used in determining fair value. There are three levels as follows:
- Level 1 - quoted prices on an active market for similar assets or liabilities; - Level 2 - inputs other than the quoted prices in level 1, which are directly observable (prices) or
indirectly observable on the market; - Level 3 - inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Explanatory notes on the Exprivia SpA Balance Sheet
Details are provided below on the entries making up the assets and liabilities that comprise the consolidated financial position, which is drawn up in accordance with international accounting standards (IAS/IFRS). All the figures reported in the tables below are in euro, unless expressly indicated.
NON-CURRENT ASSETS
1 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND MACHINERY
As at 31 December 2016, the item "property, plant and equipment" amounted to Euro 11,867,086 compared to Euro 12,805,123 at 31 December 2015. The table below shows movement in the reporting period:
The increase in the item "others", equal to Euro 148,335, pertains to plant costs (Euro 1,628), electronic office equipment (Euro 117,327), furniture and furnishings (Euro 25,684) and mobile telephony (Euro 3,696). The decreases relate primarily to the transfer of assets to an important customer in the Energy & Utilities sector, in relation to the conclusion of a contract as a result of which contractual provision was made for the acquisition of the aforementioned assets by said customer. Please note that there is a first mortgage on the real estate complex located in Molfetta (BA) at Via Olivetti 11 for a maximum amount of Euro 50 million to guarantee the precise fulfilment of obligations arising from the Euro 25 million loan taken out on 1 April 2016 from a pool of banks (for additional details, please see note 15). It should be mentioned that the net book value of leased assets amounted to Euro 387,778 and pertains to electronic office equipment for Euro 1,094 and furniture and furnishings for Euro 386,684. It should also be noted that minimum future payments within one year amount to Euro 26,796, while those due in one to five years amount to Euro 75,165.
157

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
2 - GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE
The item "goodwill" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 12,622,395 compared to Euro 12,651,838 at 31 December 2015.
Goodwill was generated in the business combinations made in previous financial years as a result of the Company's growth from acquiring companies operating in the same market.
INFORMATION RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED ON GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE: IMPAIRMENT TEST
Scope Accounting standard IAS 36 requires that impairment tests should be performed on tangible and intangible assets in the presence of indicators which suggest that this problem could exist. In the case of goodwill, as well as all other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such impairment tests should be performed on a yearly basis or more frequently in the case of special negative events that might result in impairment. Identification of CGU (Cash Generating Unit) and Allocation of Goodwill Not representing goodwill, according to international accounting standards, an asset that is unable to generate cash flow independently from other assets or groups of assets cannot be tested for impairment separately from other related assets. For this purpose goodwill is allocated to a CGU or a group of CGUs in compliance with the maximum aggregation consistent with the notion of operating segment referred to in IFRS 8. Concerning the Exprivia Group goodwill was allocated to CGUs as follows:
 Goodwill arising from business combinations through which assets were acquired and assigned to specific CGUs from an operational standpoint was allocated to the respective CGUs.
 Goodwill arising from business combinations, through which assets were acquired and to date do not refer to specific CGUs as they were assigned to different CGUs, was attributed to different CGUs in proportion to the sales volumes they generated in the financial year when the allocation was first made.
158

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
 Goodwill allocated as above was reallocated as a result of internal reorganisation in line with the same allocation criteria described above.
The table below summarises allocation of goodwill to CGUs identified:
Impairment Test Process and Assessment System The recoverability of the amount of goodwill carried in the financial statements is checked by comparing the book value allocated to each CGU and the recoverable amount in the definition of value of use. At the date of analysis, the latter is identified as the current value of future cash flow expected to be generated by the CGUs. The "DCF - Discounted Cash Flow" model was used in determining the value of use. The DCF discounts estimated future cash flow by applying an appropriate discount rate. The WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) used to discount cash flows was equal to 6.86% and was determined using the following parameters:
Cost of KE risk capital equal to 7.6% calculated according to: o risk-free rate of 1.46% equal to the average rate at 31.12.2016 of ten-year BTP with implicit country risk (source Bloomberg) o sector-based beta coefficient equal to 0.73 cleared from financial risk (beta unlevered equal to 0.62) (source: Bloomberg) o 4.2% premium for market risk (source: Bloomberg) o Small Size Premium 2% o Debt / Equity ratio of 0.19 as the target value of the sector (Source Bloomberg)
Identification of Cash Flow For the purpose of the projections required by IAS 36, strict reference was made to the current condition of use of each CGU regardless of the cash flow from any investment plans and extraordinary transactions that may constitute a "break" from normal company operations. Cash flow projections for the 5-year period used for valuation purposes are based on budgets and plans submitted for approval by the Board of Directors. The main assumptions underlying the economic forecasts 2017-2021 are as follows:
- For 2017 projections reflect the budget data for the year - for the years 2018-2021 the projections reflect an annual growth rate of 3%.
159

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The terminal value was calculated as the present value of the perpetual annuity obtained by capitalizing on the cash flow generated in the last analytical forecast period to a G growth factor of 1.2% Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis of the impaction test results was performed by taking the following variations:
- an increase in the weighted average cost of capital by 0.5 percentage points; - a decrease in growth rate of "G" of 0.2 percentage points. From the sensitivity analysis it emerges that the values in use are in any case higher than the accounting values. Conclusions No impairment loss has been reported in the impairment test that should be reflected in the balance sheet.
3 - OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
As at 31 December 2016, the balance of the item "other intangible assets" amounted to Euro 32,725 compared with Euro 260,947 at 31 December 2015. The table below shows movement in the reporting period:
The increase in the item "others" for Euro 38,847 is due to the purchase of software licenses. The decreases relate primarily to the transfer of assets to an important customer in the Energy & Utilities sector, in relation to the conclusion of a contract as a result of which contractual provision was made for the acquisition of the aforementioned assets by said customer.
4 - EQUITY INVESTMENTS
The balance of the item "equity investments" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 62,406,601 compared with Euro 65,850,601 at 31 December 2015. The item is broken down below. Equity investments in subsidiaries As at 31 December 2016 the balance of the item "equity investments in subsidiaries" amounted to Euro 62,286,708 compared to Euro 64,985,891 at 31 December 2015. The table below provides details on the item:
160

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The investments were subjected to impairment tests where impairment indicators were detected. The impairment test was performed by applying the methodology indicated in note 2 with reference to goodwill. In particular, the recoverability of the book value of the equity investment in Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl was verified, amounting to Euro 12 million, based on the cash flow projections deriving from the economic-financial forecasts for the years 2017-2021 approved by the company's Board of Directors which envisage the following main assumptions:
- for 2017 the projections reflect budget data from the year - for the years 2018-2021 the projections reflect an compound annual growth rate of 3.4% The impairment test performed highlighted impairment of Euro 6 million compared to the book value of the equity investment in Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl; therefore, a write-down was recognised based on the results of the impairment test conducted, impacted by a gradual fall in the company's volume of business. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out on the outcome of impairment tests of the equity investments assuming the following changes:  a 0.5% increase in the weighted average cost of capital;  a 0.2% decrease in the growth rate "G"; The sensitivity analysis shows that by performing the impairment test and changing the above parameters, the values in use would be lower than the book values with reference to the equity investment in Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl for Euro 6.9 million (instead of the Euro 6 million accounted for as a reduction of the value of the equity investment), as well as with reference to the equity investment in the Exprivia SLU Group for Euro 0.9 million and the equity investment in Exprivia Do Brasil for Euro 0.1 million. It should be noted that the change in the year, of Euro -2,699,182, is attributable not only to the abovementioned write-down of the equity investment in Exprivia Enterprise Consulting Srl, but: o for Euro 2,900,818, to the equity investment in Advanced Computer Systems Srl (ACS Srl). In 2016,
Exprivia SpA acquired the remaining share of 83.8% in the company, bringing Exprivia SpA's percentage owned to 100%, with a consideration of Euro 360 thousand to be paid; in fact, in 2015, Exprivia SpA already owned a stake of 16.2% in ACS Srl, included under equity investments in other
161

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
companies for Euro 741 thousand. Control of ACS Srl was acquired on 5 July 2016. Following the acquisition of control, Exprivia SpA waived receivables totalling Euro 1.5 million for loans granted to the investee in 2016 with the conversion to capital. Furthermore, Exprivia SpA paid Euro 300 for the share capital increase; o for Euro 100,000, to the incorporation of the company Exprivia Process Outsoursing Srl; o for Euro 300,000 to the waiving of the receivable, for the conversion to the future share capital increase account, with respect to Exprivia ASIA Ltd. The main figures of the aforementioned subsidiaries as at 31 December 2016 are reported below:
It should be noted that, as at 31 December 2016, there is a first-rank pledge on equity investments in Exprivia Healthcare IT Srl, Exprivia Enterprise Consultiing Srl, Exprivia Digital Financial Solution Srl, Exprivia Projects Srl and Exprivia Telco & Media Srl, representing 100% of their share capital, granted in respect of the loan of Euro 25 million taken out on 1 April 2016 with a pool of banks. Equity investments in other companies The item "equity investments in other companies" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 119,893 compared with Euro 864,710 at 31 December 2015. Details are provided in the table below:
162

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
The main change refers to the equity investment Advanced Computer Systems Srl (ACS Srl) as a result of the purchase of an additional stake of 83.8% which brought Exprivia SpA's percentage ownership to 100%. The equity investment was therefore included under equity investments in subsidiaries.
5 - OTHER NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS
Receivables from subsidiaries The balance of the item "receivables from subsidiaries" as at 31 December 2016 amounted to Euro 1,005,000 and refers, for Euro 205,000, to the interest-bearing loan granted to the subsidiary Exprivia Asia LTD and, for Euro 800,000, to the interest-bearing loan granted to the subsidiary ACS Srl. Receivables from parent companies The balance of the item "receivables from parent companies", amounting to Euro 2,596,910 as at 31 December 2016, compared to Euro 1,305,338 at 31 December 2015, refers to the receivable due to the holding company Exprivia SpA from its parent company Abaco Innovazione SpA as a result of the loan agreement stipulated by the parties in 2016. The loan, amounting to Euro 2,985,338, was disbursed in cash (Euro 1,680,000) and through the reclassification of payables outstanding as at 31 December 2015 (Euro 1,305,338). The term of the loan has been established as 7 equal deferred annual instalments. The first instalment of Euro 388,428 is due on 4 April 2017; the amount was classified to "receivables from parent companies" under "other current financial assets" (note 11). Derivative financial instruments The balance of the item "derivative financial instruments" amounted to Euro 34,568 as at 31 December 2016, and relates to the following derivative instruments:
163

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
It should be noted that the Company subscribed the financial instruments described above in order to neutralise the interest rate risk determined by an underlying variable interest rate loan (Euribor). These are cash flow hedges, measured at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result of the hedge effectiveness tests performed for these hedging instruments, the fair value changes were recognised in full in the income statement (Euro 39,232). The sensitivity analysis conducted on the change in the fair value of derivatives after a shift of 1% in the spot interest rates curve highlights that:
 upon a change of +1%, the fair value of derivatives would amount to around Euro 231 thousand;  upon a change of -1%, the fair value would be nil.
6 - NON-CURRENT TAX RECEIVABLES
Non-current tax receivables The item "tax receivables" amounted to Euro 1,348,732 as at 31 December 2016, and recorded no changes with respect to 31 December 2015, with Euro 463,272 pertaining to the subsidiaries under tax consolidation relating to the deductibility of the IRAP tax calculated on staff costs, which generated a recovery of IRES tax. Article 4 of Italian Decree Law no. 16/2012 extended the above deduction to tax periods prior to 31 December 2012 for the years 2007 to 2011. The receivables in the periods from 2009 to 2011 were recorded under non-current assets, while the receivables for 2007 and 2008 were included in the item "tax receivables" under current assets.
7 - PREPAID TAXES
As at 31 December 2016, the item "prepaid taxes" amounted to Euro 615,922 compared to Euro 569,880 at 31 December 2015. The table below provides details of the item, compared with the figures at 31 December 2015.
The item "other" refers, for Euro 149 thousand, to fees still not paid as at 31 December 2016 (tax effect of Euro 43 thousand) and, for Euro 48 thousand, to fair value changes in AFS instruments (tax effect of Euro 2 thousand).

Trade receivables The item "trade receivables" rose from Euro 18,356,242 at 31 December 2015 to Euro 16,099,818 as at 31 December 2016 and are recorded under assets net of the bad debts provision of Euro 1,599,336 as an adjustment for the risk of doubtful debts. The table below provides details on the year-end balance:
The value of invoices to be issued reflects the particular type of business in which the Company operates so, although many contracts can be invoiced on a monthly basis, others must follow an authorisation process which does not necessarily end in the month of reference. The figures shown in the financial statements are the amounts accrued up to December 2016 included and will be invoiced in the following months. The table below shows a breakdown of receivables by date of maturity, net of invoices/credit notes to be issued and with an indication of the associated bad debts provision:

Below is a table of the principal actuarial and financial assumptions used in the calculation:
175

Annual financial report as at 31 December 2016
Some of the general criteria used for the projections are described below. In order to meet the need to make assessments based on all the information available a technical procedure was used known in the actuarial literature as MAGIS (actuarial method of years in operation on an individual basis and by means of random drawings). This method is a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation that makes it possible to develop projections of amounts payable for each employee while taking into account the demographic and salary data of each position without making aggregations and without introducing average values. To make the procedure possible, drawings are made for each employee year by year to determine elimination by death, invalidity and incapacity due to resignation or termination. Reliability is ensured by replicating the procedure a certain number of times until the results are stable. The calculations were made by the number of years necessary for all the workers currently employed are no longer in service. The projections were made on a closed group, meaning no new recruits were included. In accordance with IAS 19, actuarial valuations were carried out using the Projected Unit Credit Method. This method makes it possible to calculate employee severance indemnities accrued at a certain date based on actuarial assumptions, distributing the charge for all remaining years workers are employed. It is no longer an expense to be paid if the company winds up its business at the balance sheet date, but gradually provisioning the charge according to the remaining service period of employees. The method makes it possible to calculate certain demographic and financial variables at the date of assessment, especially charges relating to service already rendered by employees represented by the DBO ­ Defined Benefit Obligation (also called Past Service Liability). It is obtained by calculating the present value of amounts due to the worker (severance indemnities) arising from seniority gained at the date of assessment. For the purpose of revaluation, the employee's termination indemnity is increased, excluding the portion accrued at the end of the period, by applying a fixed rate of 1.50% and 75% of the inflation rate recorded by the ASTAT In December of the previous year; On this revaluation are due 11%. The legislation also provides for the possibility of requiring a partial anticipation of the TFR accrued when the employment relationship is still in progress. In the calculations, the 17% annual tax on the revaluation of the TFR was taken into account.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 14 AND 16 OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE No. 39 OF 27 JANUARY 2010
To the Shareholders of Exprivia SpA
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Exprivia SpA, which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2016, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in shareholders' equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors' responsibility for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) drawn up pursuant to article 11 of Legislative Decree No. 39/10. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditor's professional judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Exprivia SpA as of 31 December 2016 and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Report on compliance with other laws and regulations Opinion on the consistency with the financial statements of the report on operations and of certain information set out in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure We have performed the procedures required under auditing standard (SA Italia) No. 720B in order to express an opinion, as required by law, on the consistency of the report on operations and of the information set out in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure referred to in article 123-bis, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree No. 58/98, which are the responsibility of the directors of Exprivia SpA, with the financial statements of Exprivia SpA as of 31 December 2016. In our opinion, the report on operations and the information in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure mentioned above are consistent with the financial statements of Exprivia SpA as of 31 December 2016.
