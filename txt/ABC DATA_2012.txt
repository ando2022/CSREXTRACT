3.2 Information on target markets

The ABC Data Group sells its products to the following customer groups:



regular IT companies, SME segment,



Internet stores,



retail store chains,



system integrators providing comprehensive IT services for large institutions,



wholesales and sub-distributors,



telecommunications operators,



foreign recipients.

For over ten years there has been intensive development of communication between the Companies of the ABC Data Capital Group and its buyers via Internet platforms and as a result the companies of the Capital Group have been holding a leading position in providing services to customers over the Internet in their home markets. The InterLink system, which has been created in Poland and adapted in the Czech Republic, Slovakia (under the name A-shop) and Lithuania with an extension to Estonia and Latvia and in Hungary, has remained a B2B solution that refers not only to the IT business. The system enables comprehensive transaction management including placing orders, checking the level of inventories, monitoring of performance of placed orders as well as seeking information on the status of payments and available buyer's credits or the status of handled claims. Within an integrated logistic system, the InterLink system enables servicing of customers who run activities in different countries, in their local languages and with the use of their local currencies. The InterLink system continues to be developed, which results in ever improved functionality and comfort of work. The market success of the InterLink service and its popularity among customers in different countries is best confirmed by the fact that over 90% of orders reach the Capital Group over the Internet. In November 2012 ABC Data started operations in Hungary where the InterLink system was activated in a similar sales model as in Slovakia or Lithuania.

The head office and logistics centre of ABC Data S.A. are located in Warsaw. The Company now has two warehouses in Poland (one with an area of 20 thousand square metres in Warsaw and one with an area of 11.5 thousand square metres in Sosnowiec). The organisation of the sales

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
system in Poland enables the Company to provide services within the entire territory of Poland from domestic warehouses. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary are serviced directly from the warehouse in Sosnowiec, while the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian markets from the warehouse in Warsaw.
Distributor's logistic efficiency is a very important criterion for suppliers and recipients as goods ordered from the warehouse need to be delivered to the recipient via a courier service within 24 hours. ABC Data S.A. fulfils that requirement and moreover offers a same-day delivery service for the metropolitan areas of Warsaw, Cracow and Katowice. A well-designed logistic network enables the Company to develop its operations in other countries of the region without the necessity of building new warehouses. ABC Data cooperates with Internet shops, owing to which deliveries can be made directly to the end customer.
The sales structure of the Group by customer groups for 2011 and 2012 is as follows:

Telecommunications 3%
Sub-distribution 11%

Export 2%

the regulations applicable to environment protection ­ has been ensuring safe disposal of waste that could not have been prevented or which could not have been recovered. The Company has performed an in-depth analysis and assessment of its operations for compliance with the Act of 25 February 2011 on chemical substances and their mixtures and the so-called REACH regulation. In order to mitigate commercial risks related to the registration process of chemicals and the duty to disclose information on product features and the rules of safe application, the Company enquired its suppliers about the extent their products are subject to the provisions of REACH. By the end of 2012 the Company received declarations from a majority of its suppliers that the products the Company buys are free from chemicals that may be released from the products intentionally during normal or predictable operation. In case of particularly hazardous substances with a candidate list published by the European Chemicals Agency on 28 October 2008, the Company has been regularly receiving appropriate documents from its suppliers.

/* The number includes all members of the Management Board irrespective of their legal relationship with the Company.
Employment at the Group as of the last day of the financial year 2012 was lower than in the previous year, which resulted from excluding persons employed at SCOP Computers S.A. in Romania. After exclusion of the data related to the employees of the SCOP Computers company, employment at the companies of the group increased as of the end of 2012 by 23 persons, mainly in the area of the Sales and Marketing Department. Increase of employment in this area is connected with geographical expansion (Hungary and development of the Export Department), further development of the team dealing with own products (Colorovo) and strengthening of product groups dealing with the market of mobile technologies. The personnel fluctuation level in the Group has been low. Employees are given opportunities to participate in training to improve their professional qualifications.

Consolidated EBITDA for 2012 was lower by 3 million from the result achieved in 2011 (after adjustment by the provision for receivables of SCOP Computers it was lower by almost PLN 2 million). The reason for the worse result at the EBITDA level was lower gross profit amount earned in 2012, caused by lower profitability of sales connected with growth of competition at the IT market and decrease of prices. EBITDA is calculated as operating profit plus depreciation / amortisation.

Increase of net finance expense in 2012 in comparison to 2011 results only from one-off events. The basic costs connected with financing current operations (costs and commissions on taken out loans and factoring agreements) decreased by over PLN 500 thousand year over year. This was connected with lower debt resulting from faster cash conversion in the Group. In 2011 sales of shares of Optimus had considerable influence on the comparability of the results.

In 2011, in connection with the threat to continuation of operations of a subsidiary SCOP Computers, a complete write-down on intangible assets (goodwill and trademark) related to that company was made in the amount of PLN 15,859 thousand.

In 2012 the Group generated considerable cash flows from operating activity. It was connected with accumulation of profits and improvement of the cash conversion cycle. The gained financial means were used mainly to decrease financial debt, repay interest and payout dividends.

Equity as at 31 December 2012 grew by PLN 7,144 thousand in relation to 31 December 2011. This growth, resulting mainly from profits, was limited by the payout of dividends and share buy-back.

The level of cash as of 31 December 2012 satisfies the operational demands of the Group. Because of constant demand for external financing necessary to maintain inventories and grant credit to the Group's recipients, it is not in the interest of the Group to keep excess financial means on bank accounts and maintain financial debt at the same time.

Decreased demand for working capital in relation to the previous year and retention of profit resulted in reduced bank borrowings by PLN 33,520 thousand in relation to 31 December 2011, in spite of payout of dividends in the amount of PLN 19,740 thousand.

The asset structure reflects the nature of the sector where current assets account for a majority proportion of the assets, in particular inventories and current trade receivables. As at the end of 2012, current assets accounted for 92% of total assets and the proportion was comparable to the end of the previous year. Current assets included mainly inventories and current receivables which accounted for 34% and 56% of the total assets respectively. The

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012

decrease of the share of receivables in total assets as of 31.12.2012 in comparison to the share as at the end of the previous year results from the change of the structure of sales and increase of turnover with export recipients characterised by shorter periods of payment.
Non-current assets contain primarily goodwill and deferred income tax asset. Decrease of noncurrent assets in 2012 results from depreciation of non-current assets, decrease of the deferred tax asset in connection with gradual payment of licence fees for the use of trademarks in the group and amortisation of intangible assets.

Current assets were largely financed with a short-term buyer's credit granted by suppliers (53% of total equity and liabilities), short-term and medium-term bank borrowings (15% of total equity and liabilities) and equity. The increased share of equity, with a similar share of trade liabilities and other current liabilities resulted in a reduced share of interest liabilities in financing the assets of the Group.

5.5.2 Management of working capital
One of the more important strategic goals of ABC Data Group is appropriate management of working capital. On the average, throughout 2012 the cash conversion cycle was lower than in the previous year. The main factor resulting in shortened cash conversion cycle was optimisation of inventories turnover and influence of the increase of share of export, which is characterised by shorter cash circulation, in the total sales.
Data provided below were cleaned from the influence of discontinued operations and are taken from management accounting.

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012

The cash conversion cycle was applied as the arithmetic mean of monthly ratios within the period. The monthly ratios were calculated as the sum of receivables collection period and inventories turnover period reduced by the payables payment period. Particular components of the monthly ratios were calculated as a relation of the level of appropriate balance sheet items at the end of the month multiplied by 30 days, and successively referred to monthly revenues increased by VAT mark-up on sales ­ in case of receivables, to monthly cost of sales ­ in case of inventories, and to monthly cost of sales increased by VAT mark-up on the purchase of goods ­ in case of payables, respectively.

Debt ratios improved in comparison to the previous year and are now at a secure level. Improvement of the ratios results from the improvement of the cash conversion cycle in the Group.
Financial leverage was determined as relation of bank borrowings to the overall book value of equity and these borrowings.

SCOP Computers in Romania, which was discussed in item 5.9 Non-typical factors and events affecting the results and economic condition of the Group below.
5.8 Compliance with projections
The Company's Management Board has not published forecasts with respect to separate and consolidated financial results for 2012.
5.9 Non-typical factors and events affecting the results and economic condition of the Group
Between 10 January and 12 March 2012 a tax inspection was conducted at SCOP Computers S.A., a company being a member of the Group, by Garda Financiara, an ANAF (Agentia Nationala de Administrare Fiscala ­ a Romanian tax office) authority. The subject of the inspection carried out by Garda Financiara was to verify the correctness of the tax returns of SCOP with respect to the intermediation of SCOP in resale and export of GPS satellite positioning services during the period between 2009 and the beginning of 2011. As a result of a cross inspection carried out at the same time in several Romanian companies, Garda Financiara questioned the provision of these services by one of the participants of these transactions, who was a direct supplier of SCOP. As a consequence, pursuant to the protocol prepared by Garda Financiara, the amount of VAT tax liabilities due though unpaid by SCOP was determined at RON 55 million while income tax liabilities were determined at RON 9 million, giving a total of RON 64 million. This constituted an equivalent of about PLN 66 million according to an average RON/PLN exchange rate announced by the National Bank of Poland on 31 December 2011. As a result of the inspection ANAF issued a "Decision on establishment of securities" on SCOP assets for potential tax liabilities, which blocked running operating activities. In consequence, the management board of SCOP has filed a motion for initiation of reorganisation proceedings. On 18 April 2012 the Court approved the motion and appointed a court supervisor, which the Company announced in the current report no. 40/2002 of 20 March 2012, which caused the loss of control over SCOP by the Group and discontinuation of consolidation. On 20 April 2012 the Company announced in the current report no. 42/2012 the initiation of reorganisation proceedings by the Court in Bucharest on 18 April 2012 and the appointment of a court supervisor in accordance with applicable procedures. At the same time, no major irregularities were identified during an earlier comprehensive tax inspection carried out and formally completed by ANAF in the period from 12 September 2011 to 12 November 2011 covering all tax aspects of SCOP's activity in the years 2006-2010. So far the Company has made payments to sellers of shares of SCOP Computers in the amount of about EUR 4.4 million (PLN 18 million). This implies that a major part of the acquisition price of SCOP Computers has not been paid and ABC Data held payments to the sellers until clarification of the matter. ABC Data did not grant sureties or guarantees to contractors and banks cooperating with SCOP Computers. If the negative scenario of tax arrears in SCOP Computers is confirmed, the Company is going to claim its rights due to losses incurred from the persons/entities from which it acquired SCOP Computers shares, performing the provisions of the investment agreement regarding the legal status of the company acquired, where obligations of the sellers are included to cover all undisclosed tax claims. In view of a hazard that SCOP Computers with its registered office in Romania may not be able to continue its operations, the Company made a write-down to its investment in the full amount. (note 20 to the financial statements).

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
As of the date of preparing these financial statements, on the basis of the received legal analysis of the actual state of the question concerning the tax inspection at SCOP, the Management Board of the Company assessed that creation of a provision for possible tax risk as of 31 December 2011 would not be justified.
5.10 Management of financial resources
During the period under report, the Group was fully able to meet its obligations to other entities. The Group financed its current operations using its own resources, short- and medium-term bank loans and discounted receivables from selected buyers under the existing factoring agreements and short-term borrowings between the companies of the Group. In order to ensure financing of its current operations, the Group pursued a diversified policy with banks as providers of funding, having split financing in the form of bank loans and factoring among several financial institutions. Because of a centralised system of supplies, the main burden of financing of operations of the Group's companies is on the Holding Company and the subsidiaries are financed through deferred trade liabilities on central supplies of goods and services. The details and parameters of the loan and factoring agreements are provided in item 4.5 Loan and factoring agreements. During the financial year, all material financial ratios of the Group, including debt ratios, were maintained at a good level. With adequately high financing limits in banks, the Group was prepared to finance increased demand for working capital and there were no problems with meeting financial obligations of the Group's companies to its contractors. In the next financial year steps will be taken to provide the Group with funding sources in amounts sufficient to implement the approved sales plans for 2013, in particular, as each year, periodic negotiations will be held with banks in order to renew short-term financing. Additional information on hazards related to financial resources is presented in item 6.4 Debt risk.
5.11 Information on financial instruments
Details of selected risks (inter alia price changes, credit risk, major interruptions to cash flows and financial liquidity risk) to which the Group is exposed and information on the objectives and methods of financial risk management, including hedging methods of material planned transactions that are subject to hedging accounting, are presented in item 6.4 Risk and hazard factors.
5.12 Off-balance sheet items
Off-balance sheet items are detailed in item 4.6 Surety and guarantee agreements.
5.13 Application of proceeds from issues
On 16 December 2011 the rights from warrants held by BRE Bank were exercised through taking up 2,878,869 D-series shares. The D-series shares were registered by the National Depository for Securities on 17 January 2012.

6 Description of development factors and prospects
6.1 Implementation of the strategy of the ABC Data S.A. Group
The ABC Data Capital Group is consistently developing an effective platform for sales, logistic services (including the improvement of warehouse processes) through implementation of integration processes of systems and procedures within the Company and at the Group level.
In Q4 2012 the Group commenced operations in Hungary.
Apart from activity conducted through local companies, ABC Data continues to develop the export activity dynamically, treating it both as completion and diversification of the current activity through the increase of sales results and taking advantage of differences in product prices in those markets as well as gaining customers and research into foreign markets before any planned expansion into those markets.
The Company has been continuing its sales development strategy of high-margin products under its own brand Colorovo in all markets where the ABC Data Capital Group operates.
6.2 Development prospects of the Company and its Capital Group
One of the most important objectives of the Capital Group is to further develop sales in the Czech, Romanian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Estonian, Latvian and Hungarian markets. The means for the achievement of that objective are to expand the offer and further develop the customer base, in particular in the SMEs and retail segments, system integrators and telecommunications operators. Another direction of development of the Company covers intensification of work related to the service of providing access to fully functional Internet stores operated by Commercial Partners of the ABC Data Capital Group companies. Additionally, there will be continued development of tools type B2B (BiznesLink) and B2C (PC Link and ResellerWEB) with access provided to all customers.

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
Continuously, one of the most promising development directions is the market related to collaboration with telecommunications operators with addition of products connected with the Telcom sector to the offer. In recent years the Company was taking actions aimed at establishing regular collaboration with telecommunications operators by concluding single large volume transactions ­ however, the potential of the collaboration remains very high. Similarly to distribution of telecommunications devices (GSM phones and smartphones), the producer only begin to notice the potential and benefits they may derive from collaboration with IT distributors. This applies in particular to the distributors who are successful in providing services to demanding customers such as large retail sale networks.
6.3 Development factors important for the operations of the Capital Group
6.3.1 Macro-economic environment influencing the operations of the ABC Data Group and the situation in the IT segment
The ABC Data Group is the leading distributor of computer hardware and software in the Central Eastern Europe region operating in the territory of Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary. In the reporting period, the Group focused on the following areas decisive for the maintenance of financial stability and effectiveness of operation on a competitive market, where it operates:
 development of operations of the ABC Data Group in the region, including a dynamic growth of sales on the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian markets and commencement of sales to customers in the Hungarian market.
 pursuit of synergy resulting from group cooperation in order to take advantage of differences in product offers and levels of prices on different markets,
 extension of the offer of high-margin products under its own brand, Colorovo, in all countries of the ABC Data Group operation,
 expansion of the offer and starting collaboration with new suppliers (i.a. mobile devices, household appliances and audio/video devices),
 dynamic development of ABC Data Group's export,
6.4 Risk factors
Risk related to the macroeconomic condition of Poland and other countries in which the Group operates
Development of the IT sector is closely correlated to the overall economic condition in Poland and in the other countries where the Group operates. Poland's economy is sensitive to the economic condition worldwide, in particular in the European Union. Any potential abrupt adverse change of the condition may have material adverse impact on the results of the Group. The financial results generated by the Group are primarily affected by the GDP growth rate, level of expenditures on IT hardware, level of salaries, investment level in enterprises, inflation level and exchange rates to PLN. There is a risk that slowed economic growth, reduced investments in enterprises, reduced public procurement contracts or increased inflation may adversely affect the business and financial condition of the Group, its financial results and development prospects.
Risk of reduced margins

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
All markets where the ABC Data Group operates are characterised by a high level of competition. The intensifying competition related to new entrants to the market, increasing market saturation with IT products and aggressive pricing policies may result in reduced trade margins. The risk may be materially mitigated by control of the margin subject to all the key elements affecting its level, active response to reduced margins (including elimination of products with lowest profitability from the offer) and considerable diversification of producers on the Group's offer.
FX risk
A large part of the products offered by the Group is provided by foreign suppliers. Transaction settlement in foreign currencies with suppliers and buyers generates a risk of fluctuating revenues and expenses as a result of FX rate changes which may adversely affect the results of the Group. The procurement structure within the Group is based on central procurement by ABC Data SA in Warsaw and further resale by the subsidiary companies (which do not operate separate warehouses) located in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary to customers in their local markets. Only a negligible part of purchases is made directly by the subsidiary companies. Since central deliveries to the subsidiary companies are made in the currencies in which the subsidiary companies sell to their customers, FX risk in those companies is negligible and the entire FX risk is managed centrally by ABC Data SA. The Holding Company mitigates such adverse effects of FX rate fluctuations by pursuing an active policy of FX risk management. To this end, ABC Data S.A. applies solutions consisting in daily indexing of the foreign currency denominated prices of the offered products. Such policy of price calculation provides on the one hand flexible adaptation of prices in the domestic currency to the current exchange rate levels while on the other hand the use of inventories of goods in foreign currencies as a natural hedge of the FX risk related to foreign currency denominated liabilities. The objective of the FX position management by the Holding Company is to maintain a balanced position of assets and liabilities in each currency, also providing for inventory volumes. The key financial instruments used to hedge the FX positions by the Company are FX Spot, Forward and Swap transactions. In 2012 the Group did not use FX options as an instrument to hedge against FX risk. Due to its pricing system and the appropriate policy of FX risk management in order to mitigate financial effects of rapid changes of FX rates and their impact on the results of the Group, as from 1 April 2010 the Holding Company started to apply hedging accounting of future cash flows from trading activities. As a result, the FX gains/losses are recognised in the period to which they actually apply and thus the risk of accidental deformation of the financial result of the Company in a given period is mitigated.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds liabilities in the form of short-term bank loans and factoring lines, most often based on 1M base interest rates for relevant currencies plus banks' margins. In view of the organisation of supplies within the Group by centralising purchases for Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Hungary in ABC Data S.A. in Warsaw, the burden of financing of operating activities lies with the holding company. Purchases by subsidiaries: Czech, Slovak, Lithuanian and Hungarian are financed with trade payables to the Holding Company. A major growth of market interest rates may adversely affect the financial results generated by the Group. The Group takes steps to mitigate the interest rate risk and prevent potential adverse effects by continuous monitoring of the situation in the money market and by efficient management of the balance sheet items that affect the working capital; however, it does not apply financial instruments hedging against interest rate risk.

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
Risk related to takeover of other entities
An important element in the development strategy of the ABC Data Group is to accelerate the growth rate of its scale of operation by taking over other entities. There is a risk that in case of some entities with which the Group is involved in negotiations the Group will be forced to abandon its investment plans since takeover transactions initially assessed as attractive will generate excessive risk or the transaction price expected by the owners of the analysed entities will not be economically justified. Also when a transaction is finalised it may turn out that future financial results of the taken-over entities and the anticipated synergy effects will prove lower than expected.
Risk related to changing prices for products
The specific feature of the IT market is regular price reduction of goods by producers as they become technically obsolete and new products are marketed. The ABC Data Group purchases goods directly from producers of IT equipment for further distribution. During the storage time until sold, prices of products may be reduced due to price reductions made by producers. The risk is mitigated by price protection clauses in the contracts with key suppliers and market practice. The clauses guarantee refund of a portion of the purchase price of unsold goods if their sales prices to Group buyers are decreased. It is a standard in the distribution sector that the producer is fully liable for changes in prices for goods on stock with distributors. Additionally, in order to mitigate the risk related to changing prices of the offered products, the Group takes effort to maintain a high rotation to inventories.
Debt risk
The Group uses external funding sources in the form of short-term and medium-term bank loans, intra-group borrowings and factoring lines. The main burden of financing the Group is with the Holding Company which supports sales to subsidiary companies in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungarythrough its central warehouse. In order to diversify its funding sources risk, in 2011 the Group split its bank funding sources among four banks financing the business of the Holding Company and three independent factoring lines for selected customers of ABC Data SA in Warsaw for ongoing discounting of receivables from those customers. Due to the trading nature of the Group's business, the amount of funding is closely correlated to the level of actual sales and quality of management of the Group's working capital (rotation periods of receivables, liabilities, stocks and inventories). Ongoing monitoring covers the efficiency of receivables, liabilities and stocks and inventories rotation in order to reduce the amount of external funding while maintaining optimum availability of products and attractive financing of customers of the Group with buyer's credit. Apart from planning of demand for external funding in its annual budget, the Group regularly monitors its debt and cash flows so that in case of need it is able to take measures to obtain additional funding required for timely payments to contractors of the Group. In the opinion of the Management Board, the existing limits cover potential demand for working capital by the Group. With regard to the fact that the Group has been generating projected financial results ­ the risk that the banks with which the Group collaborates will not prolong the funding agreements is limited in the opinion of the Management Board.
Risk related to suppliers
The business activity of the Company is based on collaboration with leading suppliers of IT hardware. In the opinion of the Management Board none of the suppliers is essential enough to cause considerable negative effect in the achievement of sales targets of the Company in case of disturbance of collaboration with such supplier. A wide portfolio of products allows effective

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
management of relations with suppliers and in situations of temporary lack of goods or fluctuations of prices makes it possible to offer alternative solutions to customer in most cases.
Risk related to dependence on IT and ITC systems
Due to the specific nature of its business, the effectiveness of the Group is largely related to the speed of data flow and processing. For those reasons, it is absolutely necessary that IT tools supporting communication and management are enhanced and operate reliably. The Group has regularly been expanding and modernising its IT infrastructure supporting business management processes. Despite the modern nature and reliable operation so far, the risk of failure of ITC systems may not be excluded or a hazard that in the future the IT infrastructure may operate less efficiently as a result of increased scale of operation or other factors, including those that are independent of the Group. Any reduced performance of the IT infrastructure used by the Group may adversely affect the effectiveness of business management, implementation of its development strategy and financial results. The Group continues to monitor the efficiency of operation of its IT solutions, and modernises and expends them so that they keep up with the development of the Company. Additionally, the Group employs a team of IT specialists to ensure rapid repair of any failures. The Group has implemented a system to control and data recovery in emergency situations.
Risk related to loss of key employees
The business of the Group and its development prospects are largely dependent on the knowhow, experience and qualifications of Members of the Management Board and other key managers. The existing demand for IT specialists and activities by competitors may result in losing key personnel and pose problems to recruitment of new employees with adequate knowhow, experience and qualifications. Thus, there is a risk that loss of key employees would have adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the Group, its financial results and development prospects. It is worth noting that staff fluctuation in the Group is low. Additionally, in order to mitigate the risk the Group keeps monitoring the labour market and tries to follow the existing trends, also with respect to the offered salaries and application of incentive programs which includes a share option scheme for top managers.
Risk related to the granted buyer's credits
The Group grants buyer's credits to its contractors and therefore it is exposed to the risk of lost receivables in case of insolvency by its partners. The risk is mitigated with insurance policies covering trade receivables, concluded either as a group or individually by all companies in the Group. Insurance coverage of receivables from customers of subsidiary companies covering Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary is provided under the Policy with TU Euler Hermes SA in Warsaw, the Czech company holds its individual policy with Euler Hermes in Prague. On the basis of decisions of the insurers, internal credit decisions are taken concerning limits of buyer's credits to customers of the Group's companies. In most instances, the buyer's credit limits do not exceed the insurance cover provided by the insurer. The Group's companies operating in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary use the internal integrated CRM system (Customer Relationship Management), which provides for risk analysis related to customers, including taking into account the history of contracts, value of orders and timely payments, and which is also used to analyse, approve and manage credit limits for individual customers. Customers' receivables are regularly monitored and in case of overdue payments, sale to such customers is suspended and collection activities are taken forthwith.

Report of the Management Board on operations of the ABC Data Group for the financial year 2012
With the effective procedure of granting, verification and monitoring of the buyer's credit, the share of irregular loans has been kept at a low level which is translated into good relations of the Group companies with the insurer and relative low insurance premiums.
Risk associated with the seasonality of sales
Sales of the Group are characterised by seasonality in the sense that sales in the fourth quarter each year are above average. The seasonality of the IT market is primarily affected by investment purchases made by institutional customers and increased purchases by retail customers around Christmas and New Year. There is a risk that increased sales in the fourth quarter may result in problems related to logistics support to sales and increased demand for working capital in that period.
Risk related to damage or loss of goods in warehouses as a result of force majeure
Storing large quantities of high-value goods at a single location involves the risk of exposing it to fire, flood, etc. It should be noted, however, that all assets of the Group (including inventories) and potential lost profit are insured. However, any incident of the above mentioned force majeure may materially restrict or even block normal functioning of the companies of the Capital Group. This will be related to temporary disruption of commercial relations with customers and may result in lost confidence in ABC Data as a supplier.
Risk related to the dominant shareholder
As at 31 December 2011, entities in the MCI Group jointly held 64.02% shares in the share capital which was equivalent to 64.02% votes at the General Meeting of Shareholders. As of the date of this report, entities in the MCI Group jointly held 62.55% of shares in the share capital, which was equivalent to 62.55% votes at the General Meeting of Shareholders.
The MCI Group, which holds a majority of votes at the General Meeting of the Holding Company may have considerably greater impact on the content of resolutions than the impact of minority shareholders.
6.5 Planned investments
The Group will continue to pursue its investment plans as specified in the strategy, in particular integration of companies in the Central and Eastern European region and warehouse modernisation. The Company has potential to finance such investments.
