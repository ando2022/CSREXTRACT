Dear Shareholders,
In 2012 the growth of Polish economy slowed down resulting in a significant drop of advertising expenditure. It was especially material in segments which are core of Agora's advertising revenues. At the same time, Polish consumers accelerated the pace of migration from traditional to digital media, which resulted in a significant drop in copy sales revenue, second largest source of Agora's revenues.
Taking into account this situation, we decided that the most urgent objective is to adapt the cost base to market conditions. We implemented restructuring program, inter alia, reducing employment in the Company by 11%. The decision to lay-off people is always painful but as other world media companies we know that it is essential.
Still, it is essential but not sufficient, as savings are only tactics not a strategy. Therefore, simultaneously with restructuring process we launched a series of new projects. We have several objectives.
Firstly, our traditional media have to face technological transformation. We adapt them to paid distribution on digital appliances. In this way we started to generate revenues from digital sales widening at the same time the audience to which we reach with our content by means of digital platforms and dedicated applications.
Secondly, we started activities on new prospective fields. Our online bookstore, Pubio.pl, launched in May 2012, quickly became an important player on e-books distribution market. The subsidiary company of Helios S.A., Next Film, started activities on cinema distribution market. We started with a blockbuster: Drogowka directed by Wojciech Smarzowski attracted almost one million people to the cinemas. Agora was also a coproducer of this film.
Thirdly, we increased the scale of our operations in selected business segments. In 2012, Helios opened seven new multi-screen cinemas and became number two cinema operator in Poland taking into account number of multi-screen cinemas in Poland. Radio TOK FM received seven new frequencies and is available for listeners in seventeen Polish cities. Diversification of printing activities brought about dynamic growth of revenues from the external clients of Agora's printing houses.
The leading motive behind our new projects is rebuilding Agora's financial results. This is strategy based on two pillars. On the one hand, preserving strict cost control policy which is essential in current market conditions. On the other hand, growth and mainly organic growth. Year 2012 showed that such possibilities exist in Agora. Now we will intensively develop new projects to increase their scale and we will constantly search for new ones.
We would like to thank all shareholders for your interest and support.
The Management Board of Agora S.A.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 12 April 2013.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union.
As at the day of publication of these consolidated financial statements, taking into account the adaptation process of IFRS by the European Union, there are no differences between IFRS and IFRS adopted by the European Union with respect to the financial reporting of the Group.
(b)Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine, which functional currency is hryvnia - UAH). All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the companies from continuing their business operations.
The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2011, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2012, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effecitve:
1) Changes to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures - Transfer of Financial Assets.
The revised standards have not had any significant impact on the previously presented consolidated financial statements.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by Agora S.A. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounter for as equity transactions.
(ii) Associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. The investments in associates are accounted using the equity method. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.

(iii) Joint-ventures

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 12

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

Joint-venture is an entity which is joinlty controlled by the dominant party or major investees and other shareholders or cooperators on the basis of the statute, company's act or the agreement signed for the period longer than one year. The investments in joint ventures are accounted using the equity method. An interest in a jointly controlled entity is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the venturer's share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity. The profit or loss of the venturer includes the venturer's share of the profit or loss of the jointly controlled entity.
(iv)Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint-ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the jointventure.
(v) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equl to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point x).

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 5 - 8 years 3 - 10 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 13

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w).
Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful lives of other intangible (except for the acquired magazine titles) assets are usually between 2 and 10 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.
(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised (see accounting policy w). Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. When the loans become impaired the Group recognises impairment losses for all interest accrued on those loans.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine ­ which functional currency is hryvnia). Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i)Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii)Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii)Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv)Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 and the recognition of the put option given to the noncontrolling shareholders.
(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

Deferred income tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants from the disabled fund
The Group's subsidiary (AMS S.A,) receives grants from the state to fund acquisition of fixed assets, which are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto (related to employment of disabled persons). The grants are recognised in the income statement as other operating revenues on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.

(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).
(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets that are owned.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.

(z)Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
In Agora Group the share incentive plans fueled by Agora S.A.'s shares are run. These plans are accounted within the scope of IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment" which came into force from 1 January 2005.
Eligible employees are entitled to purchase investment certificates in closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates is determined by applying valuation model, which takes into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates is included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates is established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased. The costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Within the Agora Group the 3-Year-Long Plan is also introduced, described in note 26B. One of the components of the plan is accounted for in accordance with IFRS2. It is a cash-settled plan with rules based on - inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In this plan, Eligible employees of the Agora Group (including the Management Board) are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Agora S.A. during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are presented in salaries and renumeration.
(ab)Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac)Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.
(ad)Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operates in a Special Economic Zone. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption is recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012 or later)
The amendments:

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 18

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

- require that an entity presents separately the items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss. If items of OCI are presented before related tax effects then the aggregated tax amount should be allocated between these sections.
- change the title of the Statement of Comprehensive Income to Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, however, other titles are also allowed to be used.
The application of the amendments by the Group will result in presenting the foreign currency translation reserve in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future.
2) IAS 19 (2011) Employee Benefits (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
The amendment requires actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The amendment removes the corridor method previously applicable to recognising actuarial gains and losses, and eliminates the ability for entities to recognise all changes in the defined benefit obligation and in plan assets in profit or loss, which currently is allowed under the requirements of IAS 19. The amendment also requires the expected return on plan assets recognised in profit or loss to be calculated based on the rate used to discount the defined benefit obligation.
The application of the amendments by the Group will result in recognizing the actuarial gains and losses related to the revaluation of the retirement severance provision in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
3) Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
The Amendments contain new disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities that are:
- offset in the statement of financial position; or
- subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
4) Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First ­ time Adopters (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
The Amendments add an exemption to IFRS 1 that an entity can apply at the date of transition to IFRSs after being subject to severe hyperinflation. This exemption allows an entity to measure assets and liabilities held before the functional currency normalization date at fair value and use that fair value as the deemed cost of those assets and liabilities in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
5) IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
IFRS 13 replaces the fair value measurement guidance contained in individual IFRSs with a single source of fair value measurement guidance. It defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and sets out disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. IFRS 13 explains `how' to measure fair value when it is required or permitted by other IFRSs. IFRS 13 does not introduce new requirements to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, nor does it eliminate the practicability exceptions to fair value measurements that currently exist in certain standards.
The standard contains an extensive disclosure framework that provides additional disclosures to existing requirements to provide information that enables financial statement users to assess the methods and inputs used to develop fair value measurements and, for recurring fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs, the effect of the measurements on profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The Group does not expect the standard to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements since the methods and assumptions currently used to measure the fair value of assets are consistent with the standard.
6) Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes - Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 19

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

The 2010 amendment introduces an exception to the current measurement principles based on the manner of recovery in paragraph 52 of IAS 12 for investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 by introducing a rebuttable presumption that the carrying value of underlying assets would be recovered entirely by sale.
The amendments are not relevant to the Group's financial statements, since the Group does not have any investment properties measured using the fair value model in IAS 40.
7) IFRIC Interpretation 20: Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
The Group does not expect the Interpretation to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements since it does not have any stripping activities.
8) Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time adopters - Government Loans (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
The amendments add a new exception to retrospective application of IFRS for first-time adopters regarding the measurement of government loans with a below-market rate of interest.
The amendments are not relevant to the Group's consolidated financial statements.
9) Improvements to IFRS (2009-2011) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
The Improvements to IFRS contain amendments to 5 standards (IFRS 1, IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 32 and IAS 34), with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group does not expect the amendmetns to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
10) Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The Amendments do not introduce new rules for offsetting financial assets and liabilities; rather they clarify the offsetting criteria to address inconsistencies in their application. The Amendments clarify that an entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off if that right is: - not contingent on a future event; and - enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity
and all counterparties.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
11) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 10 provides a new single model to be applied in the control analysis for all investees, including entities that currently are Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in the scope of SIC-12. Under the new single control model, an investor controls an investee when (1) it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvements with the investee, (2) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that investee and (3) there is a link between power and returns.
The new standard also includes the disclosure requirements and the requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. These requirements are carried forward from IAS 27 (2008).
The Group does not expect the new standard to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the assessment of control over its current investees under the new standard is not expected to change previous conclusions regarding the Group's control over its investees.
12) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures. Under the new Standard, joint arrangements are divided into two types, each having its own accounting model defined as follows: -a joint operation is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as the joint operators, have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement;

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 20

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

- a joint venture is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as joint venturers, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Under IFRS 11, jointly controlled entities treated as joint ventures, must be accounted for using the equity method. Proportionate consolidation is no longer possible.
The Group does not expect the new standard to have material material impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the assessment of the joint arrangements under the new standard is not expected to result in a change in the accounting treatment of existing joint arrangements.
13) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 12 requires additional disclosures relating to significant judgements and assumptions made in determining the nature of interests in an entity or arrangement, interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the level of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
14) IAS 27 (2011) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IAS 27 (2011) carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 27 (2008) for separate financial statements with some minor clarifications. As well, the existing requirements of IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 for separate financial statements have been incorporated into IAS 27 (2011). The Standard no longer addresses the principle of control and requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements, which have been carried over into IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group does not expect the amendmetns to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
15) IAS 28 (2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Venutres (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
There are limited amendments made to IAS 28:
- Associates and joint ventures held for sale. IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations applies to an investment, or a portion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. For any retained portion of the investment that has not been classified as held for sale, the equity method is applied until disposal of the portion held for sale. After disposal, any retained interest is accounted for using the equity method if the retained interest continues to be an associate or a joint venture.
- Changes in interests held in associates and joint ventures. Previously, IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 specified that the cessation of significant influence or joint control triggered remeasurement of any retained stake in all cases, even if significant influence was succeeded by joint control. IAS 28 (2011) now requires that in such scenarios the retained interest in the investment is not remeasured.
The Group does not expect the amended standard to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements
Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Transition Guidance (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later)
The amendments clarify the requirments for the initial application of these standards.
The Group does not expect the amendmetns to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
2) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)

The Amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirements in IFRS 10 and require qualifying investment entities to measure their investments in controlled entities ­ as well as investments in associates and joint ventures ­ at fair value through profit or loss, rather than consolidating them.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the Parent entity does not qualify as an investment entity.
3) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009), Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) and Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015 or later)
The new standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, about classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of two categories:
- financial assets measured at amortized cost; or
- financial assets measured at fair value.
The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
The amended IFRS 7 requires to disclose more details about the effect of the initial application of IFRS 9, when an entity does not restate comparative information in accordance with the amended requirements of IFRS 9.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard and its amendments on the consolidated financial statements.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996. IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Group to be restated by applying the general price index. Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Group with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount. Consequently, the restatement of equity due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Group, only the structure of the equity is affected. Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies). Consequently, due to lack of impact on equity of the Group following the hyperinflationary adjustment and lack of regulations in polish law, the Group did not post any adjustment to equity as a consequence of IAS 29 application.

12. RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER RESERVES
Dividends
Retained earnings may be paid to shareholders subject to certain minimum capital maintenance restrictions, stipulated in the commercial companies' code and according to dividend policy announced by the Company.
Frame dividend policy announced by the Company on 14 February of 2005 provides for return of excess cash to shareholders through annual dividend and ­ if the situation warrants ­ share repurchases (with cancellation) in connection with the Company's perspectives and market conditions.
For the financial year of 2011, Agora S.A. made a net profit of PLN 20,246 thousand, which was distributed in accordance with the resolution taken by the General Meeting of Shareholders (on June 22, 2012) in the form of dividend (PLN 50,937 thousand) ­ the additional amount was taken from the reserve capital. The dividend amounted to PLN 1 per share. Shareholders of record on 16 July 2012 were eligible to participate in the dividend payment. The dividend payment was made on August 3, 2012.

The Management Board of Agora S.A. ("the Company") with its registered seat in Warsaw, in relation to a regulatory filing no. 26/2012 dated August 13, 2012, on September 6, 2012 informed about:

(i) concluding on September 6, 2012 a trilateral agreement ("Agreement") with trade unions operating at Agora S.A. (which fulfills the provisions of article 3 Section 1 of the Act of 13 March 2003 on Special Rules for Termination of Employment for Reasons Not Attributable to Employees) and with works council in the Company (which constitutes an agreement in accordance with the Act of 7 April 2006 on informing and consulting employees),

(ii) adopting by the Management Board of the Company, on September 6, 2012, the resolution to execute group layoffs in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

The group lay-offs, which were to affect up to 250 employees, i.e. 10% of all Company's employees, were finalized in 2013.

On September 7, 2012 the Company, in accordance with law requirements, submitted an appropriate set of information, together with the signed Agreement, to a relevant Labor Office.
As at September 30, 2012 , the amount of provision set up for cost of group lay-offs equalled to PLN 9,192 thousand.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, in connection with announcing the group lay-offs in Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., the proper provision for lay-off cost was set up in the amount of PLN 320 thousand.
As at December 31, 2012, the total provision outstanding for usage in both companies reached in total PLN 5,349 thousand.
(ii) Provision for restructuring of advertising panels
Provision for restructuring of advertising panels was set up for dismantling costs of selected panels in AMS.
(iii) Provision for penalties, interests and similar
Provision for penalties, interests and similar includes mainly penalties for putting advertising panels on the waysides by the companies of the AMS group.

(iii) Provision for onerous contracts
The provision is connected with the rent agreement of office space by a one of subsidiaries.
(iv) Provision for the cost of compensation and severances for the former Management Board Members
In December 2011, the Company set up a provision for costs of compensation and severances for a former Management Board Member Tomasz Jozefacki.
(v) Provision for legal claims
The Group is a defendant in court cases. As at 31 December 2012 the Group evaluated the risk of loss and payment of indemnities in those cases.

Additionally, Agora S.A. is a party of legal disputes in the amount of PLN 2,387 thousand, in cases when the Management Board estimates the probability of loss for less than 50%. Such disputes are contingent liabilities.
(vi) Provision connected with the sentence passed by the Constitutional Tribunal
The provision was set up for possible costs of leveling salaries of employees from the period July 2005 - July 2008 and stems from the sentence passed by the Constitutional Tribunal concerning the interpretation of calculation rules for sick benefits. In 2011, the provision was reversed due to finishing the 3-year period, in which the employees could put forward a motion on settlement of sickness benefits.

Accounting policies for operating segments are the same as followed by the Agora Group, besides some issues described below.
Data within each reportable segment are consolidated pro-forma.

Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Operating results of reportable segments do not include: a) revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior
reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments, b) amortisation recognised on consolidation (described below).
Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income tax are managed on a Group level and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on the market basis in the manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Reconciling positions show data not included in particular segments, inter alia: other revenues and costs of Agora's support divisions and the Management Board, Agora TC Sp. z o.o., intercompany eliminations and other matching adjustments which reconcile the data presented in the management reports to the consolidated financials of the Agora Group.
Operating depreciation and amortisation includes amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets of each segment.
Amortisation recognised on consolidation can be defined as consolidation adjustments, inter alia: the amortisation of intangible assets and adjustments to property, plant and equipment recognised directly on consolidation.

26. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

During periods covered by these financial statements, the following incentive plans were carried out in the Group: A. Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments, B. Incentive Plan based on realization on operating result goal and share price increase (from 2010).

A. Incentive plan based on equity-settled share-based payments (carried out from 2005)

Eligible employees of the Agora Group participate in an incentive plan based on investment certificates in a closed end mutual fund designated to service the plan and managed by Towarzystwo Funduszy Inwestycyjnych Skarbiec SA.

The number of certificates granted depends on meeting performance criteria, not on market conditions.

In 2012 a new Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments (investment certificates) has been launched.

Purchase price of each certificate

PLN 1

Type of the plan

equity settled

During the vesting period Agora Holding Sp. z o.o. has an irrevocable, unconditional right to buy back certificates for the purchase price.

The fair value of certificates is determined by applying valuation model, which takes into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, which are disposed on behalf of the investment fund, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund, type of transferred shares and rights and limitations associated with the certificates. Consequently, the discount factor was established at the level of 23.6% (detailed description of the valuation model is disclosed below).
The fair value of certificates is established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased by the eligible employees. The costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Historical ratio of forfeited certificates (FR ratio, described below) adjusts the number of certificates granted included in the calculation of incentive plan cost (due to non-compliance with conditions attached to the scheme - obligation to work in the Group, in particular).

The fair value of investment certificates and the total cost of the Group as at the grant date were determined using the following formula:

FMV = (B-S@grant date) x (1-CD), Cost = FMV x IC x (1-FR)

2. B-S@grant date - the value of certificates as at the grant date, calculated using Black - Scholes model (BS), with following assumptions:

B ­ Incentive plan based on realization on operating result goal and share price increase (from 2010)
Eligible employees of the Company (the Management Board and top managers) participate in incentive program based on two components ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan") described below: (i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The
target is based on the accumulated operating EBITDA (excluding some adjustements, for example related to business combinations) to be reached in the years 2010-2012. The amount of potencial reward depends on the

stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the period of 2010-2012. If the stage of achieving the target will be up to 70%, the EBITDA target is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan,
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan will depend on the share price increase in the future, accounted as the difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2010 till March 31, 2010, that is equal to PLN 23.09 ("the Basic Share Price") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2013 till March 31, 2013 ("the Reference Share Price"), but not more than PLN 35.00, adjusted by: (i) the accumulated dividend per one share, to which the shareholders will be eligible in the period of April 1, 2010 till March 31, 2013 and (ii) the adjustments resulting from the share-buy back program in the period of April 1, 2010 till March 31, 2013 ("the Share Price for Reward Calculation"). If the Share Price for Reward Calculation will be lower than PLN 25.41, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan.
The reward for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of other conditions, which are non-market conditions (for example: continuation of the employment within the Agora Group, holding the same post).
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are described in the Supervisory Board resolution and for top managers in the Management Board resolution.
The fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target and is charged to the Income Statement over the whole period of the Incentive Plan, in proportion of the actual accumulated EBITDA operating level of the Group (excluding any adjustments) reached from January 1, 2010 till the balance sheet of the current financial statements in the estimated value of the operating EBITDA target.
The fair value of the provision for the cost of potencial reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan, that is from December 1, 2010 (the grant date) till June 30, 2013 (the vesting date). The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the cost to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:

33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk,
liquidity risk,
market risk,
operational risk.
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.

The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 percent of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
Investments
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in liquid securities.
Guarantees
The information on guarantees and promissory notes are descibed in note 36.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2012, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 13 and payment deadlines concerning trade payables are described in note 19.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 811 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2011: PLN 1,198 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,226 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2011: PLN 1,891 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,958 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2011: PLN 7,581 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to three months.
Agora S.A. has not been or was in 2012 engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).

Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.

Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group's operations.
The Group's objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of possible financial losses and possible damage to the Group's reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas:
requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions,
requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions,
compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements,
documentation of controls and procedures,
up-to-date analysis of the causes of operational results and setting remedial actions if a operational loss appeared or the probability of happening significant operational risk,
training and professional development,
ethical and business standards,
risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Compliance with Group's standards is supported by a programme of periodic reviews undertaken by Internal Audit. The results of Internal Audit reviews are discussed with the management of the business unit to which they relate, with summaries submitted to the Audit Committee and senior management of the Group.
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.
Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at December 2012, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to be equal to PLN 93 thousand (as at December 31, 2011: PLN 709 thousand).
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables and payables). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at December 2012, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to be equal to PLN 524 thousand (as at December 31, 2011: PLN 747 thousand).

3) Fair value hierarchy for financial instruments
The Group applies the following hierarchy for disclosing information about fair value of financial instruments ­ by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are observable, directly or indirectly, market data; Level 3: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are not based on observable market data.

The table below shows financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date:

35. CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS
Contractual capital and investment commitments (mainly fixed and intangible assets) existing at the balance sheet date amounted to PLN 4,393 thousand (31 December 2011: PLN 20,529 thousand).
As at balance sheet date, future capital and investment expenditures budgeted by the Group for the following 12 months amounted to PLN 104,620 thousand (31 December 2011: PLN 140,630 thousand).
36. CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COLLATERALS
As of 31 December 2012, the Company had contingencies, guarantees and other collaterals arising in the ordinary course of business from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise, other than those noted below:

The total amount of the contingencies, guarantees and other collaterals is smaller than 10% of the Group's equity.
Additionally, Helios S.A. issued blank promissory notes as collaterals for bank loan agreements and finance lease agreements (described in note 13) and guarantees on rent agreements.
Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to PLN 742 thousand in 2012 and PLN 605 thousand in 2011.
Panels situated near the side of a road
AMS S.A. finished in Warsaw the process of moving its large format advertising panels to localizations outside the side of the road. Mounting the panels of the type Backlight 18 square meters, Backlight 32 square meters, Billboard 18 square meters and Cityscroll 9 square allowed to increase the sales potential of Premium and Superpremium segments and enabled to become entirely independent from the city policy regarding the side of the road.
AMS received many administrative fines for using the waysides for its panels. The appeal procedures are conducted in front of the Local Self-government Appeal Committee (Samorzadowe Kolegium Odwolawcze) or in front of the Voivodeship Administrative Court (Wojewodzki Sad Administracyjny). The provisions for possible administrative fines reached PLN 2,835 thousand as at December 31, 2012 (as at December 31, 2011: PLN 3,598 thousand).

40. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the cash flow forecasts have been prepared.
There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and
2) pre-tax discount rate.

Basic information about the method applied is summarized below:

In relation to cash generating unit relating to activities in outdoor segment, the change in the two key assumptions (each of them separately and all other assumptions leaving unchanged), could result in the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU being equal to its carrying amount.

In 2012, the impairment losses on several magazine rights were recognized in the amount of PLN 12,410 thousand (2011: PLN 11,230 thousand). Unfavourable change in key assumptions could have resulted in additional impairment losses.
In 2012 as a result of conducted tests for impairment the impairment loss on goodwill connected with Sport4Peoople Sp. z o.o. in the amount of PLN 480 thousand was recognized.

REVENUE PLN 1,138.6 MILLION NET LOSS PLN 8.1 MILLION
OPERATING EBITDA PLN 83.2 MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 92.0 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2012, while comparisons refer to 2011. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP
According to the Agora Group (`the Group') estimates, in 2012, advertising spending for all media in Poland amounted to ca PLN 7.5 billion and decreased by almost 5% yoy. At that time, advertisers increased their advertising expenditure in Internet (up by over 8.5% yoy), and in cinemas (up by over 11% yoy). Advertisers decreased their spending in television by ca 5.5% yoy. Advertising expenditure in outdoor decreased by almost 6.5% yoy. Advertising budgets in press decreased by almost 15% yoy. Advertisers spent ca 20% less yoy in dailies and over 11% less yoy in magazines. The value of advertising market in Poland, in the discussed period of time and especially in the second quarter of 2012, was significantly influenced by European Football Championship taking place in Poland and in Ukraine, which due to administrative restrictions imposed by organizers, resulted in a limited scale of advertising campaigns on outdoor panels and in radio stations.
The Group's revenues in 2012, decreased by 7.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,138.6 million. The Group's advertising revenues, decreased by 9.8% yoy to PLN 636.3 million. The revenues from copy sales stood at PLN 152.7 million (down by 20.8% yoy), mainly as a result of lower copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza and books published by Special Projects division. The revenues from other sales increased by 13.5% yoy to PLN 215.6 million, mainly as a result of higher sales of printing services for external clients. The Group's ticket sales amounted to PLN 134.0 million and decreased by 8.4% yoy largely due to a 23.5% yoy drop in ticket sales revenues in the second quarter of 2012, as a result of lower number of tickets sold at that time, inter alia, due to European Football Championship taking place in Poland and in Ukraine.
In 2012, Gazeta's advertising sales reached PLN 202.9 million (down by 20.8% yoy). Gazeta's copy sales revenues decreased by 18.7% yoy to PLN 106.8 million. In 2012, Gazeta sold 257 thousand copies on average and its share in the advertising expenditure in dailies reached over 36.5% [4][3].
In 2012, the advertising sales in the Free Press division amounted to PLN 27.3 million and decreased by 10.2% yoy, mainly as a result of 21.6% yoy decrease in the third quarter of 2012. In 2012, the share of Agora's free newspaper (Metro) in dailies ad spend increased by 0.5 pp and reached almost 5% [3]. During the discussed period of time, the division achieved a positive operating result (EBIT) of PLN 2.8 million, which was lower than in 2011 [1]. This is a consequence of revenue decrease noted in the second half of 2012.
In 2012, revenues of the Internet segment amounted to PLN 114.0 million and were flat yoy. Due to the implemented cost saving measures, segment improved its operating result EBIT to PLN 7.4 million [1], despite the cost related to group lay-offs which burdened the segment's results in the third quarter of 2012 with the amount of PLN 1.2 million. If the influence of group lay-off cost was excluded, the operating result of the segment would amount to PLN 8.6 million [1]. In December 2012, the reach of online services from Gazeta.pl group reached 59.1%. The number of its users reached 11.4 million people [6].

In 2012, the revenues of the cinema segment increased by 0.6% yoy and amounted to PLN 205.1 million. In the discussed period of time, the segment's results were negatively affected by European Football Championship due to which lower number of tickets to the cinemas were sold in the second quarter of 2012. The number of tickets sold in Helios cinemas in 2012 decreased by ca 7% yoy to over 7.7 million tickets, which resulted in lower revenues from ticket sales and from food and beverages sales in bars operated in cinemas. Segment noted an operating result EBIT of PLN 6.1 million which was lower yoy. The results of the segment were also influenced by investment in new multiplexes. The segment results reflect full operating cost related to each new cinema, whereas the potential of revenue generation is not fully realized yet. In 2012, seven new multiplexes were added to Helios cinema network which currently features 30 modern multi-screen cinemas. In 2012, revenues of the AMS group decreased by 7.4% yoy to PLN 162.1 million, mainly as a result of 20.2% yoy decrease noted in the second quarter of 2012 due to the European Football Championship organized in Poland and in Ukraine resulting from administrative restrictions imposed upon advertisers in the cities in which the matches took place. Operating result (EBIT) of the segment reached PLN 4.2 million. In 2012, AMS group's share in outdoor advertising market decreased slightly (down by ca 0.5pp) to almost 30% [8]. In 2012, the value of outdoor advertising market in Poland decreased by almost 6.5% yoy [8].
In 2012, the Radio segment revenues grew by 2.3% yoy to PLN 88.1 million. The segment's operating cost increased by 3.1% yoy, mainly due to higher outlays for air time purchase in the third party radio stations. The segment noted a positive result (EBIT) of PLN 2.8 million.
In 2012, revenues of the magazine business reached PLN 65.0 million and dropped by 13.7% yoy. Additionally, the segment's results were negatively affected by the impairment loss of PLN 12.4 million recognized in 2012. As a result, in 2012, the segment noted an operating loss at the EBIT level of PLN 7.7 million [1]. If one excluded the negative influence of impairment loss and group lay-offs in Agora S.A. the operating result of the segment in 2012 would be positive and would amount to PLN 5.2 million [1].
In 2012, total net operating cost of the Group decreased by 2.6% yoy and reached PLN 1,151.7 million, despite the cost of group lay-offs in Agora S.A. and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., which burdened the Group's results with the amount of PLN 9.5 million and impairment of fixed assets in the amount of PLN 17.6 million. This cost savings result mainly from 29.5% yoy drop in marketing and promotion expenditure and lower yoy non-cash expense relating to share-based payments.
In 2012, operating EBITDA of the Group decreased yoy to PLN 83.2 million. The Group's operating result was negatively affected by lower sales revenues (down by 7.8% yoy) as well as the cost of group lay-offs and oneoff costs, which burdened the Group's result with PLN 27.1 million. The above mentioned cost impacted also the deferred tax. In the third quarter of 2012, the Group's results were burdened with the cost of group layoffs in Agora S.A. in the amount of PLN 9.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Group recognized an impairment of fixed assets in the amount of PLN 17.6 million. Additionally, in the last quarter of 2012, group lay-offs were executed in Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. and burdened the Group's results with PLN 0.3 million. As a result, the Group closed 2012 with the operating loss (EBIT) of PLN 13.1 million and net loss of PLN 8.1 million. The net loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent amounted to PLN 9.0 million. Excluding the cost of the group lay-offs in Agora S.A. and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., which burdened the Group's result in 2012 with the amount of PLN 9.5 million as well as impairment loss, operating EBITDA of the Group in 2012 would amount to PLN 110.3 million and the operating result (EBIT) would be positive and would amount to PLN 14.0 million. The Group's net profit, excluding the above costs, would amount to PLN 13.0 million in 2012.
At the end of December 2012, the Group's cash and short-term monetary assets amounted to PLN 223.7 million, out of which PLN 190.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and PLN 32.8 million in short-term securities.

II. EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP
1. EXTERNAL FACTORS
1.1 Advertising market [3]
According to the Agora's estimates, based on public data sources, in 2012, the value of total advertising expenditure in Poland in 2012 decreased by almost 5% yoy, as a result of limited advertising expenditure in each of the quarters of 2012. The only segments that noted a growth of advertising expenditure in 2012 in Poland were Internet and cinema. Advertising expenditure in Internet grew by over 8.5% yoy and in cinema by over 11% yoy.
In 2012, the value of advertising budgets in dailies decreased by ca 20% yoy, in magazines by over 11% yoy and in TV by over 5.5% yoy.
A consecutive quarter of limited advertising expenditure in outdoor advertising resulted in almost 6.5% yoy drop in the value of outdoor advertising in 2012.
An increase of radio advertising expenditure in the fourth quarter of 2012 partly compensated the drops experienced by the radio business in the previous quarters and as a result in 2012 the value of radio advertising market decreased by ca 3% yoy.
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media.
2. INTERNAL FACTORS
2.1. Revenue
In 2012, the Group's total revenues decreased by 7.8% yoy to PLN 1,138.6 million, mainly as a result of 11.3% yoy drop noted in the second quarter of 2012.
In 2012, advertising sales of the Group decreased by 9.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 636.3 million with the largest drops observed in Newspapers and Outdoor segments.
At the same time, advertising revenue grew in Internet segment by 8.6% yoy to PLN 89.8 million, in Radio segment by 1.5% yoy to PLN 85.8 million, mainly due to higher revenues from brokerage services in the third party radio stations and in the Cinema segment due to, inter alia, barter cooperation with other business segments in the Group.
In 2012, the Group's total revenues from the copy sales decreased by 20.8% yoy to PLN 152.7 million. The main reasons for this decrease include lower copy sales of press titles, smaller number of more expensive editions (dual pricing offer), lower number of book collections published by Special Projects division and price decrease of selected press titles. The smaller yoy number of published magazines also contributed to the drop of copy sales revenue. In the discussed period of time, the revenues from the copy sales in Gazeta Wyborcza decreased by 18.7% yoy and in the Magazine segment by 15.8% yoy.
In 2012, the revenues from tickets sold in the cinemas composing the Helios network amounted to PLN 134.0 million and decreased by 8.4% yoy. In the discussed period of time, cinema going in Poland was negatively affected by large sports events, especially European Football Championship EURO 2012 taking place, for the first time, in Poland. In the discussed period of time people bought 7.7 million cinema tickets in the Helios network, i.e. ca 7.0% yoy less than in 2011.
In 2012, other revenues increased by 13.5% yoy to PLN 215.6 million, mainly as a result of growth in the sales of printing services to external clients. Revenues from the sales of book collections published by Special Projects division and from the sales of food and beverages in the cinemas from Helios network were lower yoy.
2.2. Operating cost
In 2012, total net operating cost of the Group reached PLN 1,151.7 million and decreased by 2.6% yoy despite the cost of group lay-offs in Agora S.A. and Agora Poligrafia Sp.z o.o., which burdened the Group's results with the amount of PLN 9.5 million and the one-off cost of PLN 17.6 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2012.

The Group's staff cost (excluding non-cash cost of share-based payments and cost related to group lay-offs decreased by 0.8% yoy. The largest drop of staff cost was observed in the Newspapers segment. The increase in staff cost was observed in the Cinema segment and was related to the expansion of Helios network with seven new multiplexes in 2012.
The Group's headcount, at the end of December 2012, was 3,085 employees and was lower by 397 FTEs than at the end of December 2011. These numbers do not include, the people who received the dismissal notice but still served the notice period till the end of 2012. The group lay-off, which was to affect up to 250 employees, i.e. 10% of all Company's employees, was finalized in 2013.
Total non ­ cash expense relating to share - based payments (described in note26A to the annual financial consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group) charged to the Group's profit and loss account in 2012 it amounted to PLN 2.5 million.
The Group offers its employees other incentive plans (for example: cash motivation plans, incentive plans in sales departments etc.), which cost is charged to the Group's staff cost. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, the Group's operating result is burdened quarterly by the cost of Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the Management Board members and higher managerial personnel (described in note 26B to the annual consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group). In 2012, this cost amounted to PLN 1.0 million.
The cost of external services in 2012 increased by 0.4% yoy to PLN 356.7 million, inter alia due to higher cost of aerial time purchase in the third party radio stations and higher cost of sales of brokerage services. Additionally, higher rental cost for outdoor panels and higher cost of space rent in shopping centres for cinema operation contributed to the growth of this cost postion.
In 2012, cost of raw materials, energy and consumables amounted to PLN 244.3 million and decreased by 2.5% yoy. The drop in this cost position results from its methodical decrease from the second quarter of 2012 as a result of, inter alia, the decrease in the cost of consumables due to lower production cost of book series in Special Projects division as a result of lower number of projects yoy. This compensated for higher energy cost related to the expansion of Helios network and increased heatset production (printing services).
Promotion and marketing expense decreased by 29.5% yoy to PLN 81.2 million. The largest decrease took place in Newspapers' segment.
3. PROSPECTS
3.1. Advertising market
In 2012, value of advertising expenditure in Poland decreased by almost 5% yoy.
Taking into account current forecasts in macroeconomic environment in Poland and Europe and their influence on advertising market, the Company estimates that in 2013 the value of advertising market in Poland shall decrease by ca 5-8% yoy.
The Company is of the opinion that Internet and cinema may be the only media in which advertising expenditure shall grow in 2013. According to the Company's estimates, Internet advertising expenditure (including search engines) may increase by ca 2-5% yoy, whereas cinema advertising may grow by 0-3% yoy. Other media shall experience further cuts in the value of advertising expenditure.
The largest limitations in advertising expenditure may be observed in dailies: ca 22-25% yoy. Other medium that may note deepening of negative trends in advertising expenditure are magazines with drops by ca 13-16% yoy in 2013. Moreover, the Company is of the opinion that advertisers may also limit their expenditure in TV. These drops in TV advertising expenditure may reach 7-10% yoy in 2013. The value of outdoor advertising in Poland in 2013 may decrease by ca 3-6% yoy. Radio advertising expenditure may shrink by ca 4-7% yoy.
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market, lack of reliable data on the average market discount rate and ongoing change in the way of media consumption and short span of time in planning advertising campaigns.
Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media.

3.2. Operating cost
The group lay-off, which was to affect up to 250 employees, i.e. 10% of all Company's employees, was finalized in 2013. In the third quarter of 2012, the cost of group lay-offs burdened the Group's results with PLN 9.2 million. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, in one of the subsidiary companies, Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., the process of group lay-offs was initiated. It burdened the Group's results with the cost of PLN 0.3 million. The Company estimates that possible savings resulting from the above processes may amount to ca PLN 18 million.
The Group shall continue tight cost control policy to be able to act accordingly to the changes in the economic environment, with focus on advertising market and further limitations in advertising expenditure especially in those market segments in which the Group's media are active participants.
3.2.1 Cost of external services
The cost of external services shall be dependent on the cost of film copies for the cinema business, EUR/PLN exchange rate and cost of brokerage services. Additionally, this cost position may increase due to the planned openings of new cinemas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
3.2.2 Staff cost
Taking into account weakening condition of the advertising market and dynamic changes in media environment, the Group adapts its scale of operation to market conditions in particular business segments. The group lay-off, which was to affect up to 250 employees, i.e. 10% of all Company's employees, was finalized in 2013.Due to this process, the cost of PLN 9.2 million was charged to the Company's and the Group's profit and loss account in the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, group lay-offs were executed in Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. and burdened the Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the cost of PLN 0.3 million.
The Company estimates, that group lay-offs executed in Agora S.A. and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. should bring about, annually, savings in staff cost of ca PLN 18 million.
The staff cost can be influenced by the execution of development projects within the Group (including openings of new cinemas) as well as previous restructuring projects implemented in the Group.
3.2.3 Non ­ cash expense relating to share - based payments
In 2013, the Group shall execute the last part of the incentive plan based on the Company's shares. Estimated total cost related to share ­ based incentive plans to be charged to the Group's 2013 profit and loss account shall amount to PLN 1.4 million and will be recognized in the first half of 2013.
3.2.4 Promotion and marketing cost
Due to the market situation and limited number of promotional campaigns within the Agora Group's segments, the promotion and marketing cost decreased in 2012 by 29.5% yoy to PLN 81.2 million. In 2013, the Group plans to keep this cost position at the similar level as in 2012. However, it should be remembered that the level of promotion and marketing expense depends on the dynamics of particular media development, as well as the number of projects (including new multiplexes) and the market activities and projects of the Group's competitors.
3.2.5 Cost of raw materials and energy
In 2012, the cost of materials and energy increased, mainly as a result of increased volume of production for external clients (printing services) and expansion of Helios cinema network. The level of this cost in 2013 will be dependent mainly on the price of newsprint, the volume of production and EUR/PLN exchange rate. It should be remembered that this cost position shall be influenced by seven new multiplexes opened by Helios in 2012 and further expansion of cinema network in 2013.
3.3. The Group's main objectives in 2013
Making the plans for the future, Agora Group has to take into account both, a foreseen economic slowdown as well as fundamental transformation of media sector and its business models.

Taking above into consideration, Agora Group set its main objectives for 2013. We want to accelerate digital transformation of Agora's media. In 2012, we created digital versions of majority of our publications. The readers may access these publications by means of the most popular distribution platforms and dedicated applications, including mobile ones. Gazeta Wyborcza was the first Polish daily available on Microsoft Windows 8 platform and Wysokie Obcasy Extra was the first Polish magazine fully adapted for iPhone. We also launched an innovative application Sport.pl LIVE, which quickly proved to be a success. We want to increase the scope of paid digital content. The growth of revenues from paid content and digital advertising is a key objective for the nearest future. To achieve this goal, Agora Group plans to implement necessary technological solutions to manage better the Group's digital content. We want to develop the Group's main segments and expand the scope of their activities in related business fields. In 2012, we strengthened our position as the cinema operator. In 2013, we plan a consecutive stage of cinema network development, including opening of four new multiplexes. Thanks to the Group's position on this market, we entered into the cinema distribution business. As a result, a film entitled Drogowka directed by Wojciech Smarzowski entered Polish cinemas in 2013 and quickly proved to be an attendance success. Agora was also a co-producer of this film. In 2013, we plan to introduce other film productions into Polish cinemas. Agora has been a successful book publisher for years. In 2012, we launched an online bookstore Publio.pl with an offer audiobooks and e-books. We want to increase the number of publications in Publio.pl and prepare for users dedicated applications for iOS and Android systems. The next objective of the Group for 2013 is to adapt the organizational structure to new market environment to provide full utilization of the Group's internal resources as well as financial efficiency. Maintaining financial discipline is essential in current economic and market environment. At the same time, future depends on successful transformation, which requires investment in indispensable resources, including technology.

12. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk
Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2012, advertisers spent almost 5% yoy less on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in Internet (by over 8.5% yoy), in cinema (by over 11% yoy). Other media suffered further erosion of advertising expenditure: dailies down by ca 20%, magazines by over 11% and outdoor by nearly 6.5%. Additionally, ad spends in TV were lower by over 5.5% yoy.
On the basis of the current macroecomic situation as well as on the advertising market, the Company estimates that in 2013 the value of advertising market in Poland will shrunk by ca 5-8% boy. Additionally, it should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.
Seasonality of advertising spending
The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year. Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarters.
Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market
The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting nearly half of the advertising market expenditure (49%) in 2012. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 17.5% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted 10.5% and 6.5% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2012, 7.5% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted nearly 7.5% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted almost 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2013 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 45

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year2012 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content and introduces payment for access to its digital base. Nowadays, it is hard to evaluate the impact on the Group's revenue.
The Group also publishes a free daily ­ Metro. We cannot predict how the global changes occurring on the press market will influence the free press position and consequently, the position and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive. Number of internet users in Poland increases steadily which attracts new advertisers to this medium. The level of Internet ad expenditure is also characterized by seasonality. The first and the third quarters of the financial year are usually characterized by lower revenues and the fourth quarter is marked by higher revenues. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged.
Outdoor
Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. This segment of advertising expenditure is also characterized by seasonality. The highest revenues in this segment are usually noted in the second and fourth quarter. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
On July 27, 2010 AMS S.A. and Ströer Polska entered into a consortium agreement to jointly apply for a concession contract with the municipal authorities of Warsaw. On July 28, 2010 the companies submitted a motion to execute a consession agreement. On November 26th, 2012, the municipal authorities of Warsaw represented by Public Transport Authority in Warsaw, decided that the offer submitted by consortium AMS S.A. and Ströer Polska is the best one. On December 6th, 2012, CAM Media, the company participating also in the consession process, filed a complaint to Voivodship Administrative Court in Warsaw on the decision taken by the municipal authorities. On March 21, 2013 the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw overruled the complaint submitted by CAM Media. According to information revealed by the representatives of CAM Media in interviews, the company plans to file a consecutive complaint to Supreme Administrative Court. There is no certainty how and when the complaint will be settled.
Cinema
Helios group opens new cinemas mainly in shopping centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish Real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators. Additionally, the repertoire and number of movies screened in 3D technology affect results of Helios. Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, cable networks, Internet, home cinema systems or DVD, which may decrease popularity of cinema going.
Risks of running licensed business
The Group comprises local radio stations broadcasting under the brands Zlote Przeboje and Roxy FM and superregional radio TOK FM. Radio broadcasting in Poland is licensed. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted. There is a risk that demand, from listeners, for a certain radio format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 46

Radio stations Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
Impairment tests Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Company runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.
Currency risk The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the printing services, purchase of production materials, mainly newsprint, and gadgets inserted in magazines, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
Risk of losing key employees The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
The risk of collective dispute On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o. and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.
13. FACTORS AND UNUSUAL EVENTS WHICH HAD INFLUENCE ON THE RESULTS OF BUSINNESS ACTIVITIES FOR 2012 WITH THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR INFLUENCE
A negative impact on the Group Agora in 2012 have had annual impairment tests. As a result of verification of the financial projections of the business segments of the Agora Group, the Group recognized an impairment loss in the total amount of PLN 17.6 million. This amount includes the impairment loss on selected press titles in the Magazine segment and on ceased press title Autobit, goodwill recognized on Sport4People Sp. z o.o. and impairment of selected assets in Special Projects division. Additionally, the group lay-offs carried out in Agora S.A. and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. burdened the Group's results with PLN 9.5 million. Moreover, further limitation of ad expenditure in 2012 had a negative impact on the Group's results as 55.9% of the Group's total revenues came from advertising. A negative factor influencing the Group's revenues has been also the worldwide trend of declining copy sales which affected Gazeta Wyborcza and magazines published by Agora.

Agora Group has a diversified portfolio of media and each of them as part of its operations undertakes cultural, sports and educational projects. These activities constitute a part of segments' or brands' development within the Agora Group. The most important information regarding these projects can be found on the Company's website. Actions undertaken by Agora's media are of serial or ad hoc nature as an answer to a specific social problem or event. To the actions of cyclical character one can include the action Firma przyjazna matce (Mother friendly company) organized so far by editorial office of the magazine Dziecko (Child) and Poradnik Domowy (Housekeeping) or the action Rodzi po ludzku (Humane birth) organized by Gazeta Wyborcza.

II. BEST PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT BOARDS OF LISTED COMPANIES
According to the corporate governance rules of the companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Company operates its corporate website in Polish and English. Apart from legally required information Agora's corporate website offers basic corporate documents as its Statutes and by-laws of its governing and supervising bodies. Additionally, the website presents the professional biographies of the members of the Management and Supervisory Board. According to the requirements, the Company publishes on its website financial statements and regulatory filings as well as information on the participation of women and men in Company's governing bodies. Additionally, to facilitate the analyses of the financial information, the Company provides PowerPoint presentations with the quarterly financial reports and audio recordings from the teleconferences during which members of the Management Board discussed the Group's financial results in a given period of time.
According to the requirements, on the website one can also find the part dedicated to general meetings of shareholders, which traditionally take place in the Company's headquarters in Warsaw. On the website, one can find all the documents relating to a general meeting of shareholders, including announcement on convening the general meeting, the candidates to the managing or supervising bodies together with their professional biographies as soon as the Company receives them from the entitled entities. Here, one can also find all organizational information as a break in general meeting of shareholders or changes in the agenda of the meeting.
On June 22, 2012 the General Meeting of Shareholders of Agora S.A. took place in its headquaters in Warsaw and all the documents relating to that Meeting were published on the Company's website. The General Meeting was convened by the Management Board of Agora S.A. Its course took place in accordance with Commercial Companies Code and the By-laws of General Meeting. The Members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board as well as the representatives of the Company's Auditor were present during the General Meeting of Shareholders and were ready to answer all the questions according to their competencies and law.
In case of questions from shareholders and answers to those questions during the general meeting of shareholders they are available for everyone due to the fact that the Company records the meetings of shareholders. Additionally, the Company prepares the list of questions and answers relating to a given meeting of shareholders if they appear before and during meeting of shareholders. The answers are given by the Management Board and Supervisory Board members present during the meeting.
Here, one can also find the documents relating to the dividend, for example the Management Board recommendation on profit distribution, draft resolutions and final resolutions.
The Company publishes on its website reports relating to its compliance with corporate governance rules and information relating to the rule on changing the auditor examining the Group's financial statements. The Company, every year, in its quarterly report published on its website provides information on the cost of motivation plans in the Company (including the one based on the Company's shares).
In the section relating to the Supervisory Board, the Company provides information on one member of the Supervisory Board related to the shareholder entitled to more than 5% of votes during general meeting of shareholders. Here one can find the Supervisory Board reports together with the evaluation of the Company's internal risk control system and risk management system.

III. BEST PRACTICE FOR SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
The Supervisory Board of Agora S.A. complies with all the requirements of the corporate governance rules.
As part of its duties the Supervisory Board prepares the concise evaluation of the Company together with the evaluation of internal control system and risk management system. This evaluation is published on the corporate website together with all the documents relating to general meeting of shareholders.
Additionally, the Supervisory Board examines and gives its opinion on all issues being the subject of the general meeting of shareholders. The representatives of the Supervisory Board participate in the general meeting in the composition enabling them answering possible questions voiced by shareholders. In 2012, the Supervisory Board was represented by its President Mr. Andrzej Szlezak.
In case of relation between a Supervisory Board member and the shareholder entitled to more than 5% of votes during the general meeting of shareholders this person informs about that fact the Management Board of the Company and other members of the Supervisory Board. Similar situation takes place in case of conflict of interests or possibility that such a conflict of interests may arise.
In 2012 none of the members of the Supervisory Board resigned from his or her function. As far as independence of the Supervisory Board members and information on committees of the Supervisory Board is concerned, it is discussed in detail in further part of the report.
IV. BEST PRACTICE OF SHAREHOLDERS
Agora S.A., as a public company, allows the representatives of media to participate in its general meeting of shareholders. Also, during the last General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2012, the representatives of media were invited to participate. In case the Company plans to introduce the changes in the by-laws of general meeting of shareholders it tries to inform about it in advance to make it possible for shareholders to execute their rights.
During the General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2012 there were no changes introduced in the bylaws of the general meeting. In 2012 the general meeting did not resolve on share issue. The resolution on profit distribution provided for the compliance with the term ­ of no longer than 15 working days between the date setting the right to dividend and the day of dividend payment. The General Meeting did not resolve on conditional dividend or division of nominal value of the Company's shares.
Since several years, the Company provides real-life broadcast of the general meeting of shareholders in Polish and in English. During the General Meeting of Shareholders held in 2012, the Company did not provide the shareholders with the possibility of bilateral communication by electronic communication means where shareholders could have taken the floor during the Meeting from a location other than the General Meeting or could have exercised their voting right either in person or through a proxy, inter alia, due to safety reasons. The Company will analyse the possibility to comply with this requirement in the future provided that the available software shall gurantee safety of the general meeting and its efficient course taking into account the dispersed nature of the Company's shareholder base.

This rule does not apply to the members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board. The remuneration of the Management Board members is set by the by Supervisory Board on the basis of the recommendation prepared by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee ­ an advisory body within Supervisory Board.

The members of the Supervisory Board receive all necessary information regarding the Company's and Group's operations. Moreover, if there is a need to provide any additional information or clarification to the Supervisory Board members the Company does it instantly.
Agora Group has a diversified portfolio of media and each of them as part of its operations undertakes cultural, sports and educational projects. These activities constitute a part of segments' or brands' development within the Agora Group. The most important information regarding these projects can be found on the Company's website. Actions undertaken by Agora's media are of serial or ad hoc nature as an answer to a specific social problem or event. To the actions of cyclical character one can include the action Firma przyjazna matce (Mother friendly company) organized so far by editorial office of the magazine Dziecko (Child) and Poradnik Domowy (Housekeeping) or the action Rodzi po ludzku (Humane birth) organized by Gazeta Wyborcza. The competition organized by AMS S.A. - Przemoc. Twoja sprawa (Violence. Your Business) is an example of an ad hoc action. Moreover, Agora's media promote spending free time in an active way, for example by means of the action Polska biega (Poland runs) or Polska na rowery (Poland on bikes).
As far as the recommendation concerning the due care for the quality of reporting practice by means of communication expressed on the Company's corporate website with regard to untrue information on the Company, the Management Board of Agora S.A. shall make a decision to take their position in each case separately.
