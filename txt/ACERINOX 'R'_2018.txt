Letter from the Chairman
Dear shareholders:
I undertake once more the pleasant task of addressing you through these lines to inform you about the results of the business year 2018 and to summarize you the most relevant events occurred during the year.
World economy kept growing during 2018, even though at a slightly lower grade as the previous year 3.7% despite of the weaker economies of Europe and Asia, all this having as background a quite generalized political instability.
It should be noted how the third and, more relevantly, the fourth quarter of the year have been disappointing in most economies. During the last quarter, industrial production has decelerated except for the United States, world trade has been reduced below 2017 average levels and metal prices have been decreasing since the month of August, partially due to the weakness of Chinese demand.
All these circumstances in addition to the reduction of optimism about business results, trade wars and the expectations of a future shrink in global growth, corrected the shares of the companies in the most advanced economies at a downward trend in almost every stock market during the last quarter.
The stainless steel sector wasn't exempt from the characteristics of the global economy during the year. Therefore, global production increased a 10% during the first nine months of the year but was later strongly corrected in the last part of the year finishing it according to our estimates at a 5.5%. China, as usual, was the main manufacturer holding a 52% of global production, while a new player appeared this year, Indonesia, with a strong increase in its production due to the new plant that the Chinese company Tsingshan has in the country, provoking a supply surplus in the Asian market with a very negative effect on prices that has ended up affecting all markets.
The performance of the most relevant markets for our company has been imbalanced. The American market and, more specifically, that of the United States, is the most relevant for us and had a good performance both in consumption and prices due to the good shape of its economy and the
2

efficient tariff measures enforced by the implementation of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which reduced the imports of flat product around a 16%, as well as the good performance of consumption sectors, mainly those of construction and household appliances.
The fall of apparent consumption in the European market during last year was close to the 2% due to the strong correction of the fourth quarter. During the year and, more specifically, in the second half, a supply surplus has taken place as consequence of the increase in imports, which for flat products reached the 30% market share, provoking a downward pressure over prices. This relevant increase demonstrates the inefficiency of the safeguard measures adopted by the European Union during the year, what the sector already anticipated to the communitarian authorities with no success.
South African market had a great recovery in apparent consumption in line with last years' average thanks to the good performance of demand in sectors such as the automotive or the holding tanks industry, allowing Columbus to improve its sales in the domestic market, even if this positive aspect was neutralized by an increase in imports tensioning prices.
The Asian market has been characterized, as I previously indicated, by the supply surplus which has negatively affected prices. Demand in this market has had a very good performance with an apparent consumption in China of a 7%, pushed by the majority of sectors except for the automotive sector and despite of the perceived slowdown of Chinese economy. In ASEAN we have increased our volume of sales thanks to our plant Bahru Stainless, boosted as well by the good demand in the region even if affected by a very negative feature of prices due to the eruption of the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan in Indonesia.
With such a complex and uncertain environment during the business year, the economic results obtained by our company could be considered as good. With 5,011 million euros in net sales, an 8% higher than 2017 and the highest in the last ten years, we have generated an EBITDA of 480 million euros, only a 1.8% lower than the year 2017, after carrying out an inventory adjustment to the net realizable value of 22 million euros and with an impact of dollar depreciation of 14 million euros, all this despite of the tensions and bad results in the fourth quarter. EBITDA margin 9.6% has decreased a percentage point below the 10.6% of last year, strongly sustained by the United States. The net results obtained have been of 237 million euros, the best ones in the last years.
We have already mentioned in other occasions the relevance that we give to cash generation. In 2018 operating cash flow has been of 326 million euros, which has enabled us to allocate 155 million euros to investments, pay the dividend and purchase Treasury Stock for 128 million euros.
Cash generation after taxes and dividends has been of 43 million euros, having reduced net debt by the end of the year to 552 million euros, 57 million euros less than the 609 million euros of the previous business year.

Letter from the Chairman
The company's consolidated balance shows a healthy financial situation which, in addition to the excellent financial ratios that we can present, grants us the capacity to confront the future both in the trend towards growth but also to handle potential future scenarios of market deceleration.
Notwithstanding the previous and with the aim of giving a faithful image of our investments and offering enough financial flexibility to our subsidiaries, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken two decisions in respect to our participation in Bahru Stainless:
- The first one has been to carry out a value impairment of Acerinox S.A. investment in Bahru for 155 million euros, a decision thoroughly explained in the economic report and which has no impact on the consolidated results of the year.
- T he second one has been to undertake a capital increase in Bahru, with no allocation in cash, capitalizing 335.5 million dollars of the loan granted by Acerinox S.A. to its subsidiary. This decision was made once Acerinox S.A. had acquired the 30% of Bahru's shares held by Nisshin Steel, having as a positive effect to give financial flexibility to our subsidiary reestablishing its balance in equity.
As I have already mentioned, almost all the world stock markets had a relevant downward correction in the second half of the year; its causes are well known and its consequences have been the losing of value of companies, a greater volatility and a scenario in which it has been hard to manage market investments.
Ibex 35 index and our shares couldn't avoid the trend shown by all markets and Acerinox that had evolved in line with Ibex 35 during the first half, had a worse performance than the index in the fourth quarter as consequence of the complications surged at the European market for our products, the fall in petroleum prices, the news of a possible slowdown of the Asian market and the threat of a possible recession in the medium-term. Our shares fell a 27.3% during the year in comparison with Ibex 35 fall of a 15%; nevertheless we had a much better performance than our most direct competitors Aperam and Outokumpu.
We are convinced that markets are not reflecting correctly the intrinsic value of our asset and that our shares have a great potential of revaluation, what is supported by the analysts that evaluate them in their assessments and the recommendations they make.
Based upon the estimates that we manage, the Board of Directors decided last December to propose to the Shareholders' General Meeting an 11% increase of the dividend, from 0.45 to 0.50 euros per share.
It has also considered optimal to design a long-term program to reduce the number of shares and therefore compensate the shares issued in the four years during which the dividend was paid
4

through a flexible dividend and for this end it will propose to the Shareholders' General Meeting a first Share Buy-Back Programme of up to a 2% of the Share Capital for its later amortization, to which up to 66 million euros will be allocated.
The Board of Directors has kept working on improving and optimizing our Corporate Governance with the goal of making it recognized and valued for its excellence by markets and the investors that operate in them. I would like to recall the most relevant developments that have taken place during this year.
The Executive Committee of the Board has consolidated itself as the organ to analyze and deepen the complex topics and everything related to the strategy of the Company, being its analysis of great use to facilitate the decision-making process of the Board of Directors; this new perspective has obliged to hold a higher number of sessions.
Once more, the Audit Committee has had a very intense activity in rigorous compliance with the technical guide 3/2017 of the CNMV (Spanish Stock Market Commission), enacting its own regulation in which it systematizes the relationship of this Committee with external and internal auditors, personnel in charge of compliance as well as with all the other organs of the Company.
The Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee has considerably increased the number of meetings held during the year, having devoted them to the wide range of activities it covers, from which are worth noting the approval of the new remuneration system for the company's senior management, the boosting of the elaboration of a new succession plan for the key posts in the Group, the design of the action plans deduced from the self-evaluation undertaken by the group or the researches carried out regarding composition, structure and remuneration of the Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility, which are included in the NonFinancial Information Record as part of the Annual Report, being in compliance with law 11/2018 on non-financial information and diversity.
I would like now to highlight the relevant events occurred after the closing of the business year and which I consider, for different reasons, important for the future of our Company.
The first one is related to the shareholder that has accompanied us since the very beginning of our Company, the company Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. This society was acquired at the end of the year by the also Japanese company Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation who, from that moment on will hold the shares that Nisshin owned in our Company. I believe it corresponds to these lines the duty to thank Nisshin for the permanent support it has given to our Company all along our history and, at the same time, to welcome the new Company which will finally be our shareholder, as well as express our conviction that its philosophy and contribution to our development will be at the same level as the one we have had until now.

Letter from the Chairman
The second event has to do with the future development of our business in a market as important for us as it is the European. On 1 February 2019 the European Commission announced the definite safeguard measures with important changes in respect to the provisional measures of July 2018 and that, as we have been remarking, weren't very effective in reaching the intended goals. We believe that, with the new design of these measures they will be much more effective and will help to reach the goals, thus improving the future conditions of this market.
As we have mentioned many times before, predicting future is always one of the most risky exercises, even more in the uncertain and volatile times we have to live in, in which changes occur from one day to the other and at a speed never seen before. On one hand, international economic organisms make weaker projections of growth in global economy for the year 2019 and the next year 2020 than the ones reached in 2018 and with unbalanced growths by regions, what will probably be reflected on the different conditions and characteristics of the markets in which we operate. On the other hand, there are other analysts of economic reality sustaining that we could be approaching the end of a business cycle and that a new recession difficult to measure could occur in the upcoming years. And others are confident that, as long as the great difficulties we now confront are solved, a positive effect will enhance again a vigorous growth.
Regardless of the circumstance that finally arises, in Acerinox we want to have a strategy to confront any scenario, from the most optimistic to the most pessimistic one. We believe that we are ready for this challenge as we have attributes which differentiate us from our competitors and are key for success:
- The better geographical diversification of the sector, with presence in different markets that has been so useful in this year 2018 to obtain our results and that could be determining when confronting performances differentiated by markets.
- Having a good product mix with new offers in certain markets.
- A good competitive position as a result of the investing effort during the years.
- A healthy financial structure.
Being all this of great relevance when confronting that uncertain future, I believe our constant attitude of self-commitment is even more important and therefore we want to focus on optimizing and developing our position for the future with a permanent improvement of our competitive position. In order to do so, the "Excellence Plan 360º" has been designed and launched, focusing on those operations which are less efficient, correcting their deficiencies and making the right decisions to improve them, promoting initiatives that allow us to complement our range of products in areas that we don't cover yet, with a careful financial management and the permanent goal of generating value for our shareholders in accordance with the social responsibility that as a company corresponds to us.
6

I would like to finish as always by thanking all the persons being part of the human capital of our company for their work and effort, without them and their effort it would be impossible to reach the goals that we set. I would like to thank as well the permanent effort of an excellent management team, never sparing an effort and who are the evidence of the great talent that we have in Acerinox. I also thank our Board of Directors for its efficient work in defending the social interests and, in this occasion and due to the changes in the Board that will take place in the next General Meeting, a special acknowledgement to the Directors who are leaving the Board for their loyalty and the good faith they have demonstrated in the time they have performed their functions. And lastly, the most sincere thank you to all our shareholders for their trust and support. Sincerely, Rafael Miranda Chairman of the Board of Directors

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
Dear shareholders:
I'm honored to address you once again to inform you about the results of the business year 2018 and explain the context of the stainless steel sector in which we have developed our activity, as well as to inform you of other relevant aspects of our Company.
During the business year 2018 we have obtained similar results to those of 2017 even though in very different circumstances. Net sales, 5,011 million euros, were an 8.3% higher and the highest in the last ten years. EBITDA, of 480 million euros, was only a 1.8% lower, being the second highest in the last decade and the results after taxes and minority interests of 237 million exceeded in a 1.3% those of the previous business year being as well the best one of the already mentioned period.
We have reduced our debt in 9.4% to 552 million euros and debt/EBITDA ratio stood at 1.15 times, a ratio that we consider very adequate for such a volatile sector depending on economic cycles as it is the stainless steel sector. Financial expenses have been substantially reduced and stand at 2 million euros, an amount 89% lower than that of the previous year.
In order to obtain these results we have melted 2.44 million tons in our melt shops and we have processed 1.75 million tons of cold rolled materials , a new record in our history. Our sales in volume increased in a 2.2%.
We consider these results to be positive taking into account how complicated it is to control the business in a framework of such a high volatility, quickly reacting to changes in the market and assuring cash generation and debt level. If the high volatility in variable income markets is remarkable, physical markets of basic materials like ours are becoming every time more similar to them, reacting in the same way, quickly and sharply, to economic expectations.
In 2018 we have seen how the European economy slowed down with a weaker growth in each quarter. If during the first three months of the year the Gross Domestic Product growth was of 2.4% the evolution afterwards was of 2.2%, 1.8% and 1.4% in the last quarter. The Industrial Production Index started the year with a 3.1% in the first quarter and was losing ground, 2.5% in the second, 1.1% in the third and finished the year in negative, -1.1% in the last three months of the business year.
8

China had a similar performance; its Gross Domestic Product went through a growth of a 6.8% in the first quarter, a 6.7% in the second one, a 6.5% in the third one and a 6.4% in the fourth one. Its Industrial Production Index evolved negatively, 6.8%, 6.6%, 6.0% and 5.7%.
On the contrary, United States' Gross Domestic Product started began the year at a 2.6% and grew a 2.9% in the second quarter, 3.0% in the third one and 3.1% in the fourth one. The US economy surprised again for its strength, sustained by the protectionist measures, trade negotiations and fiscal policies. Therefore its Industrial Production Index had a solid performance; its evolution by quarters was of 3.4%, 3.4%, 5.1% and 4.3%. The geographical diversification of our Company allowed us to take advantage of the good progress of the North American market to which we supply from our Mill in Kentucky.
The perception of this data in the markets marked two clearly differentiated periods in the past business year: the first half, in which we enjoyed the synchronized global growth with optimism, and the second half, in which we suffered the threats of a synchronized global deceleration.
The Nickel price, so important in the formation of the stainless steel price, had a similar performance to that of economic expectations. Starting at a price of 12,690 $/ton on 2 January, it reached rock bottom price on 16 January with 12,415 $/ton and its value increased month by month reaching its annual maximum on 7 June with 15,755 $/ton. Since then it didn't stop decreasing until its annual minimum of 10,660 $/ton on 31 December. Two clearly differentiated periods, one lasting 156 days in which the price increased in 3,060 $/ton and a second one of 209 days in which it decreased 5,155 $/ton. From this point of view, the year 2018 had more bad than good, as the stainless steel price transparently reflects the price of nickel and this one sets the trend in the market.
Therefore, we were favored in a very positive first period with an upward trend in prices and inventories growth while we suffered in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, in which a drastic reduction of inventories in all markets motivated by the fear of a new recession ­more than of a deceleration- took place, what might have been an exaggerated reaction. Such is the bad remembrance we have from the last crisis.
Together with the economic situation that conditions real consumption of our products and raw materials that set the trend in prices and short-term activity, the other factors directly affecting our markets are stainless steel inventories all along the supply chain and trade flows, which are very interrelated.
In the last decade we have insisted year after year on the flood of new stainless steel factories and Steel Plants in general that were being constructed in China altering traditional trade flows, and making China monopolize more than 50% of Global Production.
9

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
We now start to experience as well the effects of new manufacturers that have cropped up from the so called Chinese strategy of the "Silk Road" or the "One belt one road initiative", intended to increase China's influence in the world, especially in those countries that own raw materials and that are located in maritime trade routes. Such is the case of Indonesia that has made the grand entrance to the stainless steel market, manufacturing 5% of global production in only two years thanks to the Chinese investments carried out in a country without a big consumption of stainless steel but with great reserves of nickel ore .
In the context of this new order, the pressure of surplus production in consuming markets came by the hand of disloyal competence practices which have prompted the proliferation of protectionist measures in the last years as those taken by Europe against China and Taiwan in 2015, by the United States against China in 2017, and by almost every country against the others in a complex process of globalization in which trade barriers have become a crucial factor in our sales strategy that as you may remember, places us in more than 80 countries of the 5 continents.
There are two decisive events worth the mention during 2018 that have been crucial or our results. On one hand, the imposition of tariffs of a 25% in the United States, and on the other, the decision to establish safeguard measures in Europe. Because of their importance for our business, I believe it is worth to detain ourselves to explain these events.
The American administration decided on 8 March 2018 to implement the mechanisms known as "Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962" based on the negative effect that it considered aluminum and steel imports could have against its national security, considering both materials of a strategic importance for the country. As a result, tariffs for a 25% for almost all the countries were established except for those who agreed to reduce their exports a 30% such as South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil.
Logically, the effect of these measures was the reduction of imports, what we estimate dropped around 16%. In light of this situation and the good shape of American economy, we could increase production in this country while stainless steel prices recovered more than reasonable price levels.
The European manufacturers, ourselves included, quickly asked the European Commission to establish safeguard measures in order to avoid the deviation to our market of those materials that were no longer exported to the United States and that would harm an already saturated market by Asian imports of the previous years. Even if on 18 July provisional safeguard measures were established, the period of time between the publication of American tariffs and that date and the way in which the provisional measures were applied prevented the well-functioning of this mechanism and didn't have the desired effect. Imports to Europe grew even a 7% more, doing so at a disordered pattern which provoked the increase of inventories in the market and the fall of prices.
Fortunately, the definitive measures adopted on 1 February 2019 corrected the great part of previous mistakes and it seems, even if only a few months later, that they will be able to stabilize our market.
10

At last, the Asian markets suffered and still suffer the trade barriers imposed in the United States and the European Union due to the excessive steel production overcapacity which had been installed, mainly in China and Indonesia, in the last decade and which has provoked that stainless steel prices fall to unsustainable levels for those who follow the criteria of profitability, transparency and free market.
In this context we have developed our activity, adapting the production of our new factories to the market reality. North American Stainless could benefit from the good shape of American market, while the rest of units had to adapt to a situation caused by the fierce competence and, especially, the great damage at the European market in the last quarter of the year. With high inventory levels and prices in continuous decrease we decided to reduce production and carry out an inventory adjustment in order to guarantee cash generation and debt reduction at the same time as we avoided transferring the bad situation to the 2019 business year.
Quarter by quarter we started the year obtaining an EBITDA of 118 million euros in the first quarter, a 39% lower than the same period of the previous year that as we recall was exceptionally good because of the increase in raw materials. During the business year we cut down distances and we were able to improve 151 million in the second quarter and 154 million in the third one. Unfortunately together with the publication of the good results of the third quarter that made the whole business year widely exceed a 14% those of the same period in the last year, we were obliged to anticipate the abrupt change of the market for the last part of the year. In the fourth quarter EBITDA decreased to 58 million euros after an inventory adjustment of 22 million euros with which the year totaled 480 million euros, only a 1.8% lower than that of 2017. So to say, we were close to make it.
Nevertheless, the measures adopted allowed cash flow generation to reach 171 million euros after carrying out investments for the amount of 155 million euros. After 124 million euros in dividends, the rest of the cash was allocated to debt reduction.
The control over working capital and cash generation are critical in a cyclical and volatile sector but our confidence have made us recommend an 11% increase of the shareholder remuneration to 0.50 euros per share which will be accompanied by a share buy-back program which, at a first phase of 2%, will be submitted to the Shareholders' General Meeting.
It is worth noting how the new investments in Acerinox Europa factory, the new ZM-7 cold rolled sendzimir Mill, the new AP-5 annealing and pickling line and the total remodeling of one of its old lines AP-3 began to be operative during 2018 and are running as expected. These new investments, like others before, will contribute to improve our quality and costs and keep our equipment updated. The investment rose to 144 million euros in the business year from which a 61 % was allocated to Spanish installations.
Stainless steel is a great product that is in continuous growth, according to our estimates around 5.5% in 2018. It is an extraordinary material that keeps contributing to the economic development and is still finding new areas of application thanks to its resistance to corrosion, its mechanical properties and its appearance, the durability of the products manufactured with this material and its
11

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
capacity to be recycled again and again, makes it suitable for sustainable development and circular economy. We expect that this growth will quickly absorb the installed overcapacity and will soon enable to reestablish loyal competence at the international markets.
Meanwhile, we continue to working to improve our competitiveness. The past business year was the last year of our V Excellence Plan, plan with which we have had ten years of continuous improvements in efficiency and productivity. In this edition we achieved the 55% of the goals, that is to say, we had annual savings of 27 million euros.
During the business year we developed what will be the basis for our competitiveness and that we refer to as "Excellence 360º", a new 5 year plan with which we expect to make annual savings of 125 million euros at the end of it. In it we have integrated the improvements that we had been achieving thanks to the traditional techniques with those that we now have in our hands thanks to digital transformation. The capacity to install sensors in our equipment, connectivity, the speed of information processing, advanced data analysis, vision and artificial intelligence among other technologies will bring us very relevant improvements in the control of processes and the optimization of our production and sales capacity. They will enable us to advance towards a new productivity and efficiency standard, anticipating ourselves to problems, improving qualities and Customer Service. We are very excited with this project that we announced in February 2019 because it is going to allow us to simplify the transformation process, granting it of a clear economic meaning from the beginning.
When we talk about competitiveness, I must once again make reference to the high costs of electricity in Spain that are putting at risk the viability of Spanish industry. For industries like ours that compete at an international market, both raw materials and most consumables we use, are acquired in global markets with international prices. At the same time, our selling prices aren't different to those of our competitors. Only two assets of our costs have an exclusively national component, electric energy and workforce. Spain can't compensate the prices of electricity with cheap workforce. The other factor of processes efficiency is handled by those companies ­like ours- that have to compete with great efforts against the traditional disadvantage that we have suffered but that now has become an excessive charge.
In this Annual Report 2018 we have tried to explain in detail all the most relevant aspects for our activity, the situation in the main markets, our sales and productions, the financial situation and our income statement that illustrate with absolute fidelity the situation of Acerinox. You will also find the non-financial information record that we already audited last year anticipating ourselves to the new legislation. I hope you enjoy the reading.
It is worth noting the great advances we are achieving in accidents reduction, having reached last year the lowest rate of accidents in our history. The goal in this field can be no other than zero. Security is the most important aspect of excellence in operations.
We are working to be more sustainable and a good example of it is the fact that the CO2 that Acerinox emits in its production process is 30% lower than the sector's average. We want to keep
12

progressing in recycling and we are firmly compromised with circular economy. Not in vane we are one of the biggest Spanish recyclers thanks to the scrap we process in our installations and that we transform into stainless steel of quality. We are also committed with equal rights and policies, both of race and gender, as it couldn't be any other way in a Company that operates in very diverse Countries across the five continents. We are increasing year after year the training opportunities of our workforce and we keep incentivizing the Company's collaborations with Universities, Technological hubs and Educational Centers, convinced of the great need we have of attracting and developing talent. I would like to finish by acknowledging the confidence given year after year to our Company by all of you, shareholders, suppliers, customers and friends. We trust in responding with the effort and dedication of all those who take part of Acerinox' human capital. We have important challenges ahead and I am in no doubt that we will overcome them thanks to the great commitment of all of us and the great motivation we have to keep learning and improving so that Acerinox continues to be the international reference in the stainless steel sector.
Sincerely, Bernardo Velázquez Chief Executive Officer

2.1 The stainless steel market
During the first months of 2018 the final demand of steel had a good performance in all markets, in line with the good evolution of world economy.
The global production of stainless steel increased a 10% in the first nine months of 2018 in comparison with the same period of 2017, according to the last available figures from ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum).
The growth in the first three months was concentrated again in Asia, standing out once more China but also Indonesia due to the strong increase in production from the new plant in the country belonging to the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan, resulting in an oversupply in the Asian market with very negative effects in prices that ended up affecting all markets.
It was also characterized by the uncertainty generated by the great trade tensions which, together with the measures adopted by different countries, affected stainless steel trade flows.
All this created an advantaged situation in the United States; contrary to that of Europe and Asia where prices were pressed downwards from the second quarter of the year on.

Acerinox's sector in 2018

2.1.1 Europe The final demand in the European market evolved satisfactorily during the first half of the year. However, the price differential with Asia, the strength of the Euro and the establishment of protectionist measures in the United States made of the European market a very attractive market for imports, which reached a penetration for long product around 30%.
This increase in supply was translated into pressure on prices. As a safeguard, the European Union approved on 18 July (in force for 200 days) provisional measures with the goal of assuring supply to the European consumers but, at the same time, protecting the European market from the materials deviation, thus maintaining the traditional trade flows.
Despite of these measures, the increase of imports in the previous months as well as in the period immediately after their entry into force exerted a great pressure over prices since July.
These circumstances together with the quick decrease in apparent consumption in the last part of the year due to the high inventory levels provoked a strong correction in the market during the fourth quarter, what we estimate made annual apparent consumption decrease nearly in a -2%.

The same phenomenon was also reflected on inventory levels, which reached their maximum in the third quarter and were corrected in the last quarter. The Russian and East European markets remained stable with a growth in imports from Asia (especially by the end of the year) coming from China and Taiwan.

34

2.1.2 America The American market had a good performance, both in consumption and prices, due to the good shape of its economy. Nevertheless, a correction of inventory levels provoked a -1% decrease in apparent consumption.
According to the available data by October, flat product imports decreased a -16% due to Section 232 tariff measures.
Regarding consumption sectors, the United States experienced a general growth in construction and household appliances and a correction in the automotive sector, as it occurred in other regions, despite of its relevant growth in previous years.

On the other hand, Mexico was affected by three fundamental factors such as the presidential elections, the trade barriers from the USA and the uncertainty concerning the new NAFTA agreements.
Regarding to South America, apparent consumption in Brazil remained constant at high levels, still representing a 70% of South American consumption.
2.1.3 Africa, Middle East and Turkey The South African economy grew once more in 2018, even if at a slower pace as expected.
South African apparent consumption recovered itself going back to last years' average levels, helped by demand's rebound in key sectors such as the automotive sector or the holding tanks industry, improving Columbus' sales in the domestic market even if imports also increased.

35

Acerinox's sector in 2018
From the rest of the continent it stands out Egypt, where Acerinox opened an office by the beginning of the year and which experienced a market recovery both in public and private investment. Acerinox provided of material to some of the most important constructions in the country such as the Grand Egyptian Museum or the Suez Canal tunnels. Demand in the most important market in the region, Turkey, suffered a fall in several key sectors such as white line influenced by the Turkish lira crisis and the rise of interest rates, what paralyzed new investment projects. 2.1.4 Asia The Asian market evolution was characterized by the supply surplus in the region and the strong increase of production in Indonesia. These two circumstances kept prices in Asia way below the rest of markets during the whole year. Still, from the point of view of demand, Asian markets had a good performance in general, standing out China where apparent consumption kept growing over production, a 7% and 3% respectively, reducing the Asian Giant's surplus as it is drawn by the available statistics on a downward trend in exports for the first time in many years. Nevertheless, it has to be considered the strong increase in exports of the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan from its new plant in Indonesia. By sectors, in China it is worth noting the good performance of the majority of sectors along the year with the solely exception of the automotive sector, which according to data from CAAM (China Association of Automobile Manufacturers) registered its first decline in terms of vehicles production since the 90´s, of a -4.2%, and a -2.8% decrease in sales, according to the last available data. In the ASEAN region Acerinox sales increased once more thanks to Bahru Stainless mill supported by a healthy demand. Still, the pressure on prices because of the irruption of the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan in Indonesia was felt in the region.

2.2 Global production of Stainless Steel

Pending on the last definitive figures for the fourth quarter, Acerinox estimates a yearly growth around 5.5% in 2018 after the strong correction experienced in the fourth quarter.

3 Raw Materials
The improvement in consumption enabled an increase in prices during the first half of the year. However, the uncertainty generated by trade tensions as well as the doubts upon the global economic growth entailed a setback in prices during the last half of the year.
Nickel Nickel prices started the year 2018 with an upward trend motivated by the improvement of consumption both in the stainless sector and in other applications, mainly electric batteries. However, it demonstrated a great volatility as it proves the rise in one day, 19 April, over 15,700 USD/Mt due to the fear of sanctions to Russian manufacturers by the United States.
Prices reached their maximum at 15,755USD/Mt by the beginning of June, a level not seen since 2014. The second half of the year was marked by a continuous decrease in prices motivated by lower consumption as well as the worsening of economic expectations, finishing the year at 10,660 USD/Mt.
The continuous decrease of nickel stocks couldn't stop the downward trend in prices. The London Metal Exchange reduced its inventory levels in 160,212 Mt finishing the year with 206,400 Mt and the Shanghai Metal Exchange reduced it in 28,957 Mt finishing the year with 15,259 Mt.
It is worth noting how, even if the inventories decrease is partly related to physical consumption, it has also been relevant the use of nickel in financing agreements as well as the distributors' positioning in light of the expected future consumption increase in the electric car batteries sector.
2018 has been the third consecutive year with a negative supply-demand balance, with an estimated surplus of 125,000 Mt.
Indonesia keeps gaining relevance in nickel's sector with an estimated production of 250,000 Mt in 2018. China has also increased its production to 470,000 Mt despite of the uncertainty generated by the environmental protection measures announced in the country.

Ferrochrome As it has been usual, China's role as main producing and consuming country is the key factor in ferrochrome market evolution.
The equilibrium in chrome mineral prices, mainly in South Africa where they are needed for local ferrochrome production, and the import prices of these ferroalloys in China are determining international prices.
Prices started the year with a 21 US¢/Lb decrease in light of the fall in prices by the end of the previous year and the beginning of 2018, finishing the first quarter at 118 US¢/Lb.
The growth in global demand as well as the announcement of the possible closing of several manufacturing plants in China for environmental reasons enabled a price recovery in the second quarter reaching the 142 US¢/ Lb.
Nevertheless, a lower demand in the second half and the supply surplus in China prompted the fall in prices in the third quarter to 138 US¢/Lb and a new fall in the fourth quarter, finishing at 124 US¢/Lb.

Molybdenum The supply-demand balance of molybdenum has suffered a slight deficit during 2018.
The growth in world demand levels, mainly in the energy sector, together with the stock replenishment process provoked by the initial uncertainty concerning lack of supply, enabled an increase in prices during the first months of the year reaching its annual maximum at 13 US¢/Lb by the beginning of March, levels not seen since 2014.
Once the doubts about supply were dissipated, prices decreased to their annual minimum of 10.6 US¢/Lb by the end of June. A new stock replenishment period mainly leaded by the Asian market provoked an increase in prices during July, standing at 12.6 US¢/Lb by the beginning of August.

Despite of the economic uncertainty, the good performance of molybdenum steel demand together with the good shape of the chemical sector kept price levels quite stable around 12 US¢/Lb until the end of the year.

Ferric scrap A healthy demand enabled an increase in prices, reaching its annual maximum of 346 USD/Mt by March. As it is the case with other raw materials previously mentioned, these prices were not reached since 2014.
The uncertainty generated by the announcement of trade actions by the United States and their possible consequences provoked a correction of prices in the following months, which was stressed in August by the Turkish lira crisis. Turkey is the world's major ferric scrap importer and the possible impact in its demand entailed a strong decrease in prices down to 290 USD/Mt.
Despite of prices' gradual recovery partially due to the import activity in other countries such as South Korea or India, a weaker global demand and the macroeconomic uncertainty provoked a new fall in prices, shrinking back to annual minimum levels with 280 USD/Mt by December.

During 2018 Acerinox continued with its investment policy for new equipment and the improvement and maintenance of the existing one. In order to do so, it allocated 143.9 million euros in 2018 to this concept.
Acerinox Europa plant has the most technologically and competitively advanced equipment since the installation of its new annealing and pickling line (AP-5) that manufactures material of a maximum quality standard and which reduces costs and environmental impact while extending the range of products. As it was specified in the Group's Investments Plan, Acerinox spent 140 million euros in its acquisition and launching.
Furthermore, the plant in Campo de Gibraltar carried out a profound updating of its AP-3 line in order to specialize it in thick gauges and thus complement the products manufactured by the previously mentioned line, providing it with ultimate generation annealing similar to that of the new line in order to equate their qualities.
 In addition, new investments of 14.5 million euros were approved for the acquisition of a ladle furnace and a refrigerated vault, for the electric furnace number 2, which will enable a better optimization of melt shop productive processes and improvements in costs and energy efficiency thanks to reducing the consumption of refractory material and electrodes, reducing emissions and increasing furnace availability.
The investments in both of them totaled 87.9 million euros during 2018 business year.
In the North American Stainless plant 32.8 million euros were invested for the purchasing of new equipment.

In addition to the investments required to complete the total investments of 116 million euros with which the company developed a new bright annealing (BA) line and a cold rolling mill in 2017, NAS is constructing a new coil splicing line and new finishing equipment for the amount of 10 million euros. Columbus Stainless allocated more than 5.4 million euros to the installation of a new slitting line to offer cut to size materials to customers and to increase exports and direct sales to customers from the factory, thus improving the service and shortening the delivery time. A new ladle furnace to which 11.8 million euros were allocated, improved the melt shop productivity while reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In Roldán factory, the new investments for the installation of new production and control equipment rose to 5 million euros.

8 R+D+i
In a world such as the Steel industry every small difference matters. Therefore, the Group had clear since its origins the four fundamental axes around which its activity should turn: the product had to be better than that of competitors, the manufacturing process had to be the most efficient, it was precise to constantly find new applications and it all should be combined with a smart managing of generated waste ­not only environmental but also economic-.
Each one of the plants has its own research laboratory and all of them maintain cooperation relationships with the universities in their surroundings. Cedinox Association carries out the additional tasks of searching, assisting and supporting those who select ­or could select- stainless steel as the material for their projects and orienting them in its applications. The research laboratories search for better and more profitable alloys, explore new product applications and properties and contribute to product standardization and homologation. Many new steel grades are the result of this researching effort.
The Group companies also collaborate with public institutions in joint research programs, sometimes together with companies that could end up becoming future users of the new alloys or to benefit from the new applications discovered. A special mention in this field deserve the projects sponsored by the Ministry of Industry of Spain through CDTI (Center for the Technological Industrial Development) and CSIC (the Superior Council for Scientific Research) or the creation of the Chair in Smart Industry. In the USA we have deepened once more our relationship with the Engineering School of Louisville (Kentucky) and in South Africa with the University of Pretoria.
The R+D+i laboratories work in close association with the several workshops. Out of this coordination many improvements in the production process, time reduction and increase of the average quality have arisen.
A special chapter in which the Group companies have increased their researching efforts in the last years has been that of waste recycling. Recycling is not only inherent to Acerinox factories manufacturing ­factories that mainly use ferric scrap as raw material- but there is also an additional effort to take care of the environment while obtaining profits from it. Melt shop wastes could be an additional source of metal; the household application batteries, once being eliminated their contaminating elements by authorized companies, are a cheap source of nickel; steel lags could be a good source for the construction of roads and there are even being studied the properties of some wastes to ­in some occasions- absorb part of the atmospheric CO2. The Group laboratories are making efforts to recycle lags, paper, plastic, acids and any kind of scrap generated by our processes. Not taking these into account, 59,000 Mt of waste have been recovered as can be observed in the GRI Report 2018.
Many of the world best experts in stainless steel production are employed by the Group. The Company, being conscious of the potential in knowledge of its workforce, rewards every year the research on new productive processes, security management and environmental impact improvements with the annual "Rafael Naranjo" Awards.
50

The jury for this 2018 Edition was composed of professionals with a renowned prestige in the steel and business worlds. Several prizes were awarded totaling 45,000 euros. The first prize, the Quality and Progress Award, rewarded with 15,000 euros was granted to the project `Anti-tipper mechanism for the steel mill electric furnace 2', presented by the Mechanical maintenance group of Acerinox. In addition, in the Environment and Security categories three more prizes were granted to the projects: `Raising the temperature of the material at the entrance of the finisher due to the reduction of the time between passes in the hot rolling blooming mill'; `Argon consumption reduction in AISI 304 L steel grade'; and `Protection curtain and structural modifications to improve security in the opening of the casting ladle'. Lastly, it is worth noting how innovation is being an important leverage to develop Acerinox Digitalization process. The industrial processes are very complex and waiting for the market to come up with a solution that implies a differential impact can take too much time. Therefore, Acerinox bets for open innovation together with companies, universities and technological centers in which technology is the main enabler. This new Innovation model will enable to accelerate the implementation of projects and, above all, it will boost new cooperation methods inside the organization.

Results evolution was very positive except for the fourth quarter in which many negative factors coalesced at the European market: the flood of imports as consequence of the call effect provoked by the European Union provisional safeguard measures, aggravated by the context of raw materials decreasing prices and, as consequence, of alloy surcharges, all this in addition to the generalized economic uncertainty. In the United States, where the market has had a much healthier performance, the correction was limited to the seasonal factor which is usual in the fourth quarter.
It all significantly affected volumes, prices and margins, as it can be observed in the following chart on EBITDA evolution:

2018 was a very volatile year in all markets and very difficult to manage. The main causes which have more significantly affected quotation were: the rise of interest rates by FED, the trade war between the United States and China, the concerns about a possible deceleration of world's economy, the uncertainty generated by Brexit, the political instability in several countries (including Spain) and the Turkish lira crisis.
A special mention deserves the month of October, one of the worst months for variable income since the financial crisis.
The worst performance in the year was mainly that of the banking sector with generalized falls; Banco Sabadell (-40%), Bankia (-36%) or BBVA (-35%), in addition to assets such as Mediaset (-41%), ArcelorMittal (-33%), Indra (-28%) or Inditex (-23%). On the positive side, the exceptions have been the energy companies with increases of a 16%, 13%, and 9% of Naturgy, Endesa and Iberdrola respectively.
The main stock indexes worldwide weren't either excluded from the tensions suffered during the year. The German DAX index suffered a worse fall, of an 18%, mainly due to the strong exposition it has to the automobile and industrial sectors which have strongly suffered the trade war between the United States and China.

Acerinox shares' evolution has been in line with that of Ibex 35 during the first half of the year.

First Half of the year The 16 February, the Commercial Department of the United States published the reports on the impact of steel and aluminum imports on national security. These reports were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and had a positive impact on Acerinox quotation.
The United States' trade sanctions to the major aluminum manufacturer of Russia propitiated the price increase of this raw material which pushed nickel prices upwards as well in light of the possibility of similar sanctions against Russian nickel manufacturers.

Second Half of the year The uncertainty generated by the insufficient safeguards of the European Union, the trade war between the United States and China and the fear of a world economy slowdown were the main factors affecting shares' volatility during the second half.
On another note, the Brent barrel reached the 4 October its maximum since 2014 with 86 USD, while by the end of December it felt down to 51 USD. This 40% fall did not only affect petroleum but also other cyclical industries.

10 Corporate Governance
The Acerinox Annual Corporate Governance Report corresponding to 2018 forms part of the Management Report which includes a section on non-financial information in accordance with the Royal-Decree-Law 11/2018 on non-financial information. The Management Report is available on the web page of the National Stock Market Commission ("Comisión Nacional de Mercado de Valores" in Spanish) and on the Acerinox web page since the date of publication of the annual accounts.
The Acerinox Group, through its listed company Acerinox S.A., began in 2015 a major process of adapting its corporate governance to the provisions of the recent Spanish Capital Companies Law, as well as to the recommendations made in the new Corporate Governance Report for Spanish Listed Companies.
These modifications have meant an improvement in corporate governance, through the strengthening of the role of the Board's committees, with more clearly defined competences, a greater number of independent board members and a greater presence of women on the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors also decided to continue with all the procedures designed to meet within the shortest time possible the highest number of the Recommendations detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. Details of said levels of compliance can be found in the Annual Corporate Governance Report hosted on our website at www.acerinox.com.
In 2018 the General Meeting of 10 May approved a new Board Members Remuneration Policy for the period 2018-2020. This policy can be consulted in the company's webpage.
The most relevant actions taken in 2018 are listed below:
1. Compliance with the Good Governance Code and Capital Companies Law The Company made a great effort to comply with the greatest possible number of recommendations, following the entry into force of the new Unified Code of Good Governance, and for that reason it adopted a series of highly significant decisions. The first one was to make a commitment to ensure that, by 2020, at least 30% of the members of the board would belong to the less represented gender. As of 31 December 2018, there were three independent members at the Board representing a 20% of the members and a 37.5% of the independent members.

10.1 Share capital
As of 31 December 2018, Acerinox share capital totaled 69,016,885.75 euros, divided into 276,067,543 shares, each with a nominal value of 0.25 euros.

10.2 The Board of Directors and its committees
The Board of Directors The Board of Directors is the body responsible for directing, administering and representing the Company, without prejudice to the powers conferred on the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Board has three committees: the Executive Committee, the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee and the Audit Committee.
In 2010, the company, in keeping with the best practices of Good Governance, decided to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and of the General Meeting from the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Of¬ficer, the organization's top executive.
The Board of Directors, as of 31 December 2018, has 15 members in accordance with the recommendations of the Good Governance Code and being the maximum allowed by the Articles of Association. The Secretary does not qualify as a Member of the Board.
Acerinox Board of Directors is a faithful reflection of the Company's international character and the success of the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee when applying the diversity clauses that the Directors Selection Policy auspices.
Starting by gender diversity, currently three of its fifteen Members are women. This number would be higher if not for the recent resignation of two Directors who had to stand by the compatibility rules of their new companies or to whom a higher implication for corporative reasons has been required. It is worth noting how in the past two other women had to resign before their mandate had finished because of such circumstances. The Board of Directors decided to adopt a policy to guarantee that by 2020 at least a 30% of its members will be women.
But diversity goes beyond gender regardless of how important it is. Other manifestations of diversity shall also contribute to the generation of value and the decision making processes in the core of the organism, making of it a forum to share experiences, abilities and wide and diverse knowledge.
The Board of Directors represents four different continents thanks to the diverse nationalities of its members. Europe is, logically, the most represented one, but the Board is also formed by one North American member, two Asians and one African, all belonging to the continents in which Acerinox has its production plants.
Three of its members, plus the Secretary Non-Director, initiated their professional careers in the Public Administration or in the University before joining the private sector. Seven of them have a strong industrial character and have held several positions in the steel industry but also in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, automotive, paper, new technologies and energy industries; some of them having worked in more than one of these sectors. Five of its members come from the financial world, including investment banking, saving banks and the loan sector.
Since 2016 the most important group of directors has been that of Independent Directors, with eight people, followed by the Proprietary Directors, made up of six people plus an executive director. It has been procured
71

Corporate Governance
to repeat this proportion in the Executive Commission: four Independent, one Executive and four Proprietary Directors. In the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee as well as in the Audit Commission the proportion is of three Independent and one Proprietary. Both the Board and all the other commissions are chaired by an Independent Director. The Board of Directors approved on December 2018 a modification of its Regulation in order to, on one hand adapt it to the modification in Article 25 of its Articles of Association and on the other translate to the text the suggestions of the CNMV Technical Guide 3/17 on Audit Commissions. Pursuant to the Capital Companies Law, the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 10 May 2018 approved the Remuneration Policy for Acerinox Directors for 2018, 2019 and 2020, with the favorable vote of 97.39% of the shareholders who attended or were represented in the Meeting. This policy, monitored by an external consultant in what concerns to executive directors, is in full compliance with the Good Governance Code recommendations. In line with this transparency policy, the Group made public that, in 2018, all the remunerations arising from the Board Members belonging to and attending the Board of Directors and its committees totaled 1,399 thousands of euros (excluding the amounts paid to the CEO as a salary for his managerial position). For more information on this subject, you may review the Annual Corporate Governance Report and the Report on the Remunerations received by Board Members (www.acerinox.com). In total, the Board of Directors held nine plenary sessions during 2018.

The Executive Committee The Board of Directors appointed an Executive Committee in 2008 to attend to the normal course of business and facilitate its regular monitoring. This body is presided over by the Chairman of the Board. The Chief Executive Offi¬cer is a necessary member of the Executive Committee.
In order to facilitate transparency and communication among the governing bodies, the Company's rules empower the Chairman to propose to the full Board the rati¬fication or further deliberation of any matter discussed or decided on by the Executive Committee.
For further information regarding its activities you can ¬find on the web page www.acerinox.com the section on the General Shareholders' Meeting 2019.
The Audit Committee As was the case in previous years, the Audit Committee was the most active body in 2018 in terms of the number of meetings held, a total of ten, which enabled it to develop its envisaged work plan by devoting itself to its core responsibilities, which are:
· Reporting on the annual, biannual and quarterly accounts · Supervising internal audit services and the effectiveness of the company's internal monitoring and risk
management systems. · Supervising the process of preparing and presenting the regulated financial information. · Preparing the Report covering activities carried out during the period, which will be published alongside
the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting.
The Audit Committee will apply the principles, recommendations and criteria for good operations outlined in the 3/2017 Technical Guide on audit committees in companies of public interest, which was approved by the CNMV on 27 June 2017.
The Audit Committee is chaired by an Independent Director, while the Secretary of the Board of Directors acts as its secretary.
For further information regarding its activities you can ¬find on the web page www.acerinox.com the section on the General Shareholders' Meeting 2019.
The Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee It held nine meetings during 2018, it proposed to the Board of Directors a Multiannual Remuneration Plan or Long Term Incentive (ILP for its acronym in Spanish) corresponding to the First Cycle of the Plan (2018-2020), applied to Executive Directors and Senior Management personnel of the Group consisting of the payment of part of their variable retribution in shares, as well as it proposed the Shareholders' General Meeting the ratification, appointment and re-appointment of five Members of the Board of Directors.
It has also intervened in the determination of the other retributions of the senior management.
This Committee coordinates, at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the assessment of the Board's performance. The Appointments, Remunerations and Corporate Governance Committee is chaired by an Independent Director, and the Secretary of the Board of Directors acts as its secretary.

Risks and their management

11 Risks and their management
Acerinox has a Risk Management Model for identifying, classifying, and evaluating any possible event that could affect all the units and significant functions of the organization as well as establishing the control and responsibility mechanisms derived from each one of them. The Model has the ultimate goal of providing reasonable security for attaining its objectives, whether strategic, operational, compliance, or reporting.
For the correct implementation of the measures and the strict monitoring of its fulfillment for each one of the possible contingencies, in 2015 the Group approved the Risk Management Control Policy of Acerinox, S.A. and its Group of Companies.
Through the Policy, the mechanisms and basic principles for the management of opportunities and risks are established, allowing to:
· Achieve the strategic objectives determined by the Group. · Provide full guarantees to the shareholders. · Protect the Group's results and reputation. · Defend the interests of the key Groups of Interest of the Company. · Ensure business stability and financial solidity in a sustained manner over time.
Any business activity generally has a series of risks associated to it and, in the case of steel manufacturing, Acerinox recognizes and classifies the uncertainties characteristic of the industry in which it operates.
Moreover, the substantial risks that the Company faces on a daily basis and which require of continuous management and special surveillance are interrelated and can be summarized in the following diagram:
Reputation and image

Framework
Legal and Compliance

- Macroeconomic and geopolitical context - Changes in regulation
- Regulatory and contractual non-fulfillment - Fiscal non-fulfillment - Norms and ethical code

Operational

- Security and occupational health - Working relations - Fraud and corruption - Damage to material assets - Mistakes in processes - Systems - Bussines continuity - Cybersecurity

Business Financial
Strategic

- Margin erosion (price) - Margin erosion (volume) - Increase in variable OPEX
- Exchanges rates - Interest rates - Liquidity - Credit and counterpart - Raw materials prices fluctuation - Financial information
- Regulatory uncertainty - Investments - Relationship with investors and media

82

The main risks are the following: · Competence: Business risks related to competence and trade barriers in the different international markets of stainless steel. · Overcapacity: Business risks related to the overcapacity mainly installed in China and its effects on price reduction. · Raw Material prices: Great variations of their value, especially in short periods of time. · Economic cycles: Products demand according to market evolution. · Financial: Lack of liquidity, restriction of financing sources, increase of financing costs, exchange rates volatility, interest rates volatility, credit risk. · Regulatory: Presence at the international arena with activities in numerous countries, regulatory frameworks and business areas.
11.1 Financial Risks
The Group activities are exposed to several financial risks: market risk (exchange rate risks, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group tries to minimize the potential adverse effects upon the Group's financial profitability through the use of derivative financial instruments, in no case with speculative intentions, in those risks in which they were applicable, as well as when contracting loans. The management of financial risks can be consulted in detail in Note 4 of the attached Consolidated Group Report.

Acontecimientos relevantes tras el cierre del ejercicio
Relevant events after the close of business year
European Union safeguard measures On 1 February, the European Commission announced the definitive safeguard measures, with some relevant changes with respect to the provisional measures which entered into force on July 2018 and that all together should have an impact on the European market.
These measures include more types of products, which referring to stainless steel entails the inclusion of plates, being thus included in the measures all the finished products, both flat and long.
Imports quotas are not global but rather tax quotas by country for the main origins have been applied, what supposes a relevant limitation of Asian imports which are the ones having a worse effect on prices. It should be as well considered the possibility of some countries not covering their quotas, such as it is the case of the USA, affected by the reprisal measures of the EU.
Considering the established quotas, which depart from the imports average for 2015-2017, we estimate an imports correction around 15% with which we would retrieve back to 2016 levels, what in addition to a sustained growth of European demand would help European manufacturers recovering part of their market share, reducing the imports quota in a 25% for flat product in comparison with the nearly 30% reached in 2018.
Regarding Acerinox Group it is worth noting how in November 2018 the Commission announced the no application of South Africa from the measures, reason why Columbus Stainless won't be affected by them.
Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd exchange of shares Since 26 December 2018, the Company Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. is no longer listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after its acquisition by Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation. Acerinox shares in Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. (1%) will be exchanged for shares of the acquiring company effectively applying from 1 January 2019 with an exchange rate of 0.71 Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation shares per each Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. share, meaning that Acerinox S.A. will receive 747,346 shares of the acquiring company.
Purchasing of own shares As it was explained in the note 13.1, the Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. held on 19 December 2018, making use of the authorization granted for a 5 years period by the Shareholders' General Meeting of the Company held on June 2014 and covered by article 17 of the Regulation (EU) n. 596/2014 on Market Abuse, has approved a First Share Buy-Back Program with the aim of reducing Acerinox S.A. share capital through the amortization of its own shares ­as long as the Shareholders' General Meeting so approves it- with the goal of improving the earnings per share.
84

By the closing of these Financial Statements, the Company has acquired in the framework of the Share Buy-Back Program the amount of 3,979,471 shares for the total amount of 36.7 million euros. Bahru Stainless's capital increase. The Board of Directors, at its session held on 26 February, has resolved to increase Bahru Stainless Sdn, Bhd capital, without cash injection, through the capitalization of 335.5 million USD from the loan granted by Acerinox, S.A to its subsidiary.   This solution has been adopted   after Acerinox, S.A. acquired, last December 30% of shareholding held by Nisshin Steel in Bahru. Acerinox currently holds a 97% of Bahru Stainless shares.

6. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
NOTE 1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Name of the parent company: Acerinox, S.A. (hereinafter the Company).
Incorporation: Acerinox, S.A. was incorporated with limited liability for an indefinite period under Spanish law on 30 September 1970.
Registered office: Calle Santiago de Compostela, 100, Madrid, Spain.
Corporate purpose and main activity: The Group's corporate purpose and main activity, conducted through its subsidiaries, is the manufacture, transformation and marketing of stainless steel products. With a melt shop production capacity of 3.5 million tonnes, the Acerinox Group is one of the main stainless steel manufacturers in the world. It has six stainless steel factories: two manufacturing flat products in Spain and South Africa; one producing flat and long steel products in the United States; a further two making long steel products in Spain; and another in Malaysia that makes flat steel products and currently has cold rolling production lines. The Group also has a network of sales subsidiaries in Spain and abroad that sell all its products as their main activity. Details of all the companies included in the Acerinox consolidated Group are provided in note 5, as well as the activities they carry out. The Parent Company's main activity is that of a holding company, as parent company of the Acerinox Group. The Company also renders legal, accounting and advisory services to all the Group companies and carries out financing activities within the Group.
Financial year: the financial year of Acerinox, S.A. and all the Group companies is a 12-month period. It starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December.
Annual accounts: these consolidated annual accounts were prepared by the board of directors of Acerinox, S.A., on 26 February 2019.
NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated annual accounts of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter IFRS-EU) and other applicable provisions in the financial reporting framework.
The annual accounts for 2018 have been produced using the same accounting principles (IFRS-EU) as for 2017, except for the standards and amendments adopted by the European Union which are obligatory as of 1 January 2018, such as, IFRS 9 -- Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 -- Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As predicted in the financial statements for 2017, these changes have had no significant impact at the Group. The Group has applied both standards with retroactive effect. In note 2.2 a description of the analysis made with respect to the new standards IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is included, as well as the impacts of their application.
The Group has also applied a new policy not included in the 2017 financial statements, relating to share-based payments to employees. Application of this policy is pursuant to the approval at the Annual General Meeting of a multi-year remuneration or long-term incentive plan (LIP) for certain employees via the delivery of shares in Acerinox, S.A.
The most significant standards for the Group taking effect from 1 January 2019 are as follows:
· IFRS 16 -- Leases. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This standard replaces IAS 17. It requires companies to recognise lease assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet (except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). In note 2.3 there is a detailed analysis of the assessment made by the Group on the expected impacts of applying this standard.
· IFRIC Interpretation 23 -- Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. It provides the requirements on how to reflect the effects of uncertainty when accounting for income tax. It is not expected to have a significant impact at the Group.
· Amendment to IFRS 9 -- Classification of certain prepayable assets. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, although early adoption is permitted. This amendment proposes a narrow exception to IFRS 9 for particular financial assets which, despite having contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, do not meet this condition as a result of a prepayment feature. No impact on the Group as it does not hold this type of instrument.
The Group will include the new disclosures required under these standards in its financial statements for 2019.
103

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The following are standards or interpretations pending adoption by the European Union that will be mandatory in the coming fiscal years and may have an impact on the Group:
· Annual Improvements to the IFRS. 2015-2017 cycle: The amendments affect IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23 and will apply to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group does not expect the application of these amendments to have any impact.
· Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and their associates or joint ventures: these amendments clarify the accounting treatment of sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture. The Group has no significant investments in associated companies or joint ventures.
· Amendment to IAS 19 - Amendment, reduction or liquidation of the plan: specifies how companies should determine the expenses for pensions when changes occur in a defined benefit plan. The Group does not expect the application of this standard to have any impact, since benefit plans are suitably outsourced.
· Amendment to IFRS 3 - Definition of a business: this amendment will affect the business combinations whose acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2020. Early application is allowed.
The Group has not applied any of these standards in advance.
2.2 Assessment of the impact of the new standards adopted by the Group in 2018 (IFRS 9 and IFRS 15)
The Group has started applying these new International Financial Reporting Standards on the mandatory date of application, i.e. 1 January 2018. In any case, the changes were not significant. The Group has applied these standards retrospectively, without restating the comparative figures.
IFRS 9 -- Financial Instruments The Group has assessed the main changes that implementing the standard may entail for the Group. Specifically, the points that have required a more extensive analysis by the Group are detailed below:
· Classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities. The new standard maintains, but simplifies, the mixed measurement model and establishes three main measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income. The basis for classification depends on the entity's business model and the characteristics of the financial asset's contractual cash flows. Meanwhile, the standard requires investments in equity instruments to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, with the irrevocable election at initial recognition, to present the changes at fair value through other comprehensive income, not reclassified to income for the year, provided the instrument is not held for trading. If the equity instrument is held for trading, the changes in the fair value are presented in profit or loss.
In relation to financial liabilities there have been no changes in classification and measurement, except for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss because changes in the fair value of the financial liability that are attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability must be presented through other comprehensive income. The remaining amount of the change in the fair value of the liability is presented through profit or loss for the period, unless this treatment would create an accounting asymmetry in profit or loss for the period, in which case all changes in fair value are recognised through profit or loss. In the Acerinox Group the only liabilities designated in this category are derivatives used to hedge fluctuations in the exchange rate. These are short-term financial instruments in which the variation attributed to credit risk is not significant.
In addition, IFRS 9 establishes that exchanges of debt instruments with substantially different terms will be recognised as an extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The Group has assessed the debt renegotiations that it conducted in the years 2016 and 2017, to determine whether they could result in a difference in accounting treatment. However, the Group's approach to accounting for debt renegotiations is the same as that which would have resulted from the application of this standard, so no adjustments are to be made as a result of applying the new IFRS.
The application of this standard has therefore had no impact at the Group. The Group's financial assets consist of:
· Accounts receivable: are measured at amortised cost, and the Group maintains its measurement criteria under the new standard. The Group policy is detailed in note 2.12.2 section b).
· Equity instruments: equity instruments the Group does not hold for trading and which, therefore, were recognised as available-for-sale up until the end of last year. Under the new standard, they will continue to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The only difference following the adoption of this new standard is that until now changes in the fair value had been reported through other comprehensive income, unless objective evidence exists that impairment has occurred, in which case the accumulated loss is taken from equity to profit or loss. Following the adoption of the new IFRS 9, impairment is to remain under equity. The Group does not intend to dispose of these investments, though if it did, the gains or losses on the sale would also be recognised in other comprehensive income, as stipulated in the new standard.
· Derivative financial instruments: the Group measures these instruments according to hedge accounting criteria or at fair value through profit or loss. Since the measurement methods reflect the Group's business model, no change has been made to either the classification or measurement method following the adoption of the new standard

· N ew impairment loss model based on expected credit losses and replacing the incurred impairment loss model of IAS 39. As explained in the Group's financial statements for 2017, it is the Group's policy to hedge its commercial and political risks for all sales made in any country of the world, with the exception of those made in the United States. It hedges its credit risks either through credit insurance companies, or through letters of credit and bank guarantees extended by banks of recognised solvency. The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The Group considers risk hedging to be an integral part of the insured credit, so when calculating expected credit losses, it takes account not only of the cash flows expected from collection of the receivable, but also those under the credit insurance. Meanwhile, the Group also arranges non-recourse factoring transactions whereby the risks and rewards of those assets are substantially transferred, thus leading to the derecognition of the receivables from the balance sheet, allowing it to reduce insolvency risk. Additionally, in some countries the due dates are within 30 days, allowing deliveries to be controlled and reducing any impairment losses. For all these reasons, the Group's history of losses from bad debt is very low and therefore no significant impact has arisen from this change in policy.
The Group has defined a new impairment loss model based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts at each of the subsidiaries and on the claims made under the arranged credit insurance policies, including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%90% and deductibles), and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim, whether from the insurance company or the customers themselves. The model indicates an estimated percentage of expected credit loss of 0.03% (as in 2017) on all sales made in each year. These estimates are revised through our credit risk control system (commercial and financial risk departments, risk committee and the corporate risk management department), which continuously monitors the specific markets of each subsidiary, receives input from insurance company experts and reviews the future estimates from international bodies of recognised prestige (IMF, OECD, etc.). The macroeconomic outlook for each country is also factored in. Once these parameters have been considered, the bad debt provision is calculated taking into account the likelihood of future loss, which is determined based on the composition of the trade receivables balance: whether it has coverage from insurance firms, letters of credit or where there are duly approved guarantees, and the time delay over the established due date (a delayed debt of less than 30 days does not generate the same future default risk ratio as another with a delay of 120 days, etc.).
· C hanges in the accounting of hedges: IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness. Under the previous IAS 39, a hedge must be highly effective, both prospectively and retrospectively. IFRS 9 replaces this by requiring an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and for the hedge ratio to be the same as that used for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required, but is different to that which was prepared under IAS 39. The standard seeks to align hedge accounting more closely with risk management, with a target-based approach and seeking to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses in the current model.
The Group covers the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate of its currency positions with forward exchange contracts only, while also covering the risk of interest rate fluctuations through financial swap instruments. Accounting of hedges is aligned with the Group's risk management model. Hence, no changes are expected in the accounting of hedges. The Group currently uses hedge accounting for instruments that are designated to hedge interest rate risks and does not typically use it for instruments designated to hedge changes in exchange rates. Under its policy for hedging exchange rate risk, the Group covers net positions in foreign currency and balances between Group companies, meaning it is difficult to distinguish between the part of the instrument used to cover transactions with third parties and that used for Group companies. In any event, the Group only hedges cash flow risks for transactions made in foreign currencies that are recognised in the balance sheet, so any change to the derivative is recognised in profit or loss, and is offset by any changes that may occur at each balance sheet reporting date in the monetary items recorded in foreign currencies, pursuant to IAS 21. Since the designation of these instruments as hedging instruments has not led to any accounting difference in the income statement, the Group has decided to keep the same classification as that used at the close of the 2017 period.

Consolidated Annual Accounts
IFRS 15 -- Revenue from Contracts with Customers Under this standard, revenues are recognised when a customer obtains control of the good or service that has been sold, i.e. when they have the ability to direct the use of and obtain all of the benefits from the good or service. The standard defines a five-step model for recognising revenue under a contract:
1. Identify the contract with a customer 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract 3. Determine the transaction price 4. Allocate the price to the performance obligations 5. Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation The new standard on revenue under contracts with customers defines a contract as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights or obligations. A contract does not exist if each party to the contract has the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party. The standard requires a contract with a customer to be recognised when it meets all the following conditions: a) The contract has been approved by the parties to the contract, who undertake to perform their respective obligations b) Each party's rights can be identified c) The payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified d) The contract has commercial substance e) It is probable that the consideration to which the entity is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services will be collected The process of selling stainless steel is carried out through purchase orders. The Group has evaluated the time all these conditions are met in order to determine the time at which a contract comes into existence. This analysis has revealed that orders arranged with customers do not give rise to an enforceable right or obligation, since the parties are entitled to unilaterally terminate an unperformed contract without compensating the other party up until the time the goods are delivered. Accordingly, no obligation comes into existence until the goods are delivered. Depending on the commercial terms of sale, the risk of the goods may be transferred when the materials are shipped from the Group's facilities or when they are delivered to the customer. The Group takes these terms of sale into account when determining the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods passes to the buyer. The production process is planned on the basis of the customer backlog and takes around 45 days from the time the order is accepted in the case of cold-rolled products and 30 days in the case of slabs and hot-rolled products. When determining the price, sale prices in the stainless steel market typically comprise a base price plus a variable component known as an "alloy surcharge". The alloy surcharge is calculated monthly by each of the market's stainless steel producers on the basis of a formula that takes into account the variation in the price of certain raw materials (particularly nickel, chromium and molybdenum) and fluctuations in the EUR-USD exchange rate. The alloy surcharge applied is calculated at the time the goods are delivered and is agreed upon with the customer. In other words, the amount of the consideration is highly sensitive to factors beyond the entity's control. The Group is mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale of stainless steel and there are hardly any service contracts in effect with third parties operating outside the Group. Therefore, the Group's policy when it comes to recognising revenue is compliant with the revenue recognition criteria set out in the new IFRS 15. The Group continues to recognise revenue at the time control of the goods passes to the customer, which is effectively on delivery in accordance with its terms of sale. Accordingly, the figures for 2017 presented in these interim financial statements are included for comparative purposes only.
106

2.3 Evaluation of the main standards and interpretations that will be mandatory in 2019 (IFRS 16) Valuation rule and exceptions to be applied in transition
The Group will start applying the new IFRS 16 standard for leases on the mandatory application date, i.e. 1 January 2019.
This standard replaces IAS 17 and requires that entities recognise lease assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet (except for shortterm leases and leases of low-value assets).
With respect to transition, the Group, as permitted by the standard, has decided to apply it retroactively, recognising the cumulative effect of the initial application of the standard on the date of initial application. Therefore, it will not restate the comparative information. Instead, it recognises the cumulative effect of the initial application of this standard, if any, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application. That is to say,
- It recognises a lease liability on the initial date of application for leases previously classified as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 (except for a short-term lease agreement or a low-value asset). The lessee shall measure the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the interest rate inherent in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If this cannot be easily determined, the lessee shall use the incremental interest rate of the lessee's borrowing.
- It shall recognise an asset by right of use on the date of initial application and measure that asset by right of use for an amount equal to the amount of the lease liability.
For leases classified as finance leases under IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application is the carrying amount of the asset and lease liability.
On the other hand, the Acerinox Group has decided to avail itself of the practical solution that allows the rule in transition whereby it will not reevaluate whether a contract is, or contains, a lease on the date of initial application. Instead, it allows the entity to
a) A pply this standard to contracts that have previously been identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 - Leases and IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.
b) Not apply this standard to contracts not previously determined to contain a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
Consequently, the Group will only apply the requirements with respect to the identification of a lease to contracts entered into (or modified) from the initial application date, 1 January 2019.
It also does not recognise the lease liability and the right-of-use asset for leases whose term expires within twelve months of the date of initial application. It shall account for such leases as short-term leases, i.e. as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
From 1 January 2019, the Group will identify the existence of a lease in the contracts and lease term and will measure it in accordance with IFRS 16.
In determining the lease term, the Group will consider the non-revocable term of the lease, to which the following will be added:
- the periods covered by the option to extend the lease, if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option; and
- the periods covered by the option to terminate the lease, if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will not exercise that option.
A tenancy ceases to be enforceable when both the lessee and the lessor have the right to terminate the tenancy without the permission of the other party, subjecting themselves only to a negligible penalty.
For the determination of lease payments, it will take into account:
a) fixed payments, minus the lease incentives to be collected.
b) variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or rate, initially valued according to the index or rate on the starting date.
c) the amounts expected to be paid by the lessee as residual value guarantees;
d) the exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option;
e) lease termination penalty payments, if the term of the lease reflects the lessee's exercise of the option to terminate the lease.
The Group will include the new disclosures required under these standards in its financial statements for 2019.

Evaluation of the application of IFRS 16 in the Acerinox Group

The detail of the lease expenses at 31 December 2017 and 2018, which amounted to 11,237 thousands of euros and 9,816 thousands of euros, respectively, is as follows:

Most of the Group's contracts are short-term.

Following the evaluation of the Group's long-term lease contracts and once the remaining payments have been valued up to maturity, the Group will recognise a lease liability and assets for right of use in its 2019 financial statements for an amount of 7,372 thousands of euros. The interest rate used is the interest rate implicit in the lease, or the incremental interest rate of the lessee's indebtedness, when that rate is not readily determinable.

The term of the Group's lease agreements and the amount of the payments remaining from 1 January 2019 are as follows:

The amount of the contracts for more than 10 years relates mainly to a plot of land that the company Inoxcenter Group, S.L.U, has leased to the consortium of the Barcelona free trade zone, on which the Group has built an industrial warehouse owned by it.

2.4 Basis of presentation of the consolidated annual accounts
The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared by the Directors of the Parent Company to give a true and fair view of the Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position at 31 December 2018 and 2017, as well as the consolidated results of its operations and changes in consolidated equity and consolidated cash flows for the years then ended.
For the purpose of comparison with each of the items in the financial statement, the annual accounts for 2018 also include the figures for the previous year.
These consolidated annual accounts are presented in euros, rounded off to the nearest thousand. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities, which have been measured at fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (up to 2017 called available-for-sale assets). Inventories have been measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the individual accounting records of the Company and the subsidiaries forming the Acerinox Group. The consolidated annual accounts include certain adjustments and reclassifications made to bring the accounting and presentation policies used by different Group companies into line with those of the Company.

108

The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires the Parent Company's management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and, therefore, the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement. These estimates are based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate. The Group may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances. The aspects that involve a greater degree of judgement in the application of IFRS-EU, or for which the estimates made are significant for the preparation of the annual accounts, are detailed in note 3. Qualitative and quantitative details of the risks assumed by the Group which could have an effect on future years are provided in note 4.
The consolidated annual accounts for 2017 were approved by the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting held on 10 May 2018. The Group's consolidated annual accounts for 2018 are currently pending approval by the shareholders. The Directors of the Company believe that these consolidated annual accounts will be approved with no changes by the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting.
2.5 Going concern assumption and accruals basis
The consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Income and expenses are recognised on an accruals basis, irrespective of collections and payments.
2.6 Consolidation principles
a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company either directly or indirectly exercises control. The Company exercises control over a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Furthermore, the Company is understood to have power over a subsidiary when it has existing substantive voting rights that give it the ability to direct the financial and operating activities and policies of the subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual accounts from the date on which control commences to the date on which control ceases.
The Group has considered potential voting rights in assessing its level of control over Group companies.
The subsidiaries' accounting policies have been adapted to Group accounting policies.
The Acerinox Group's consolidated subsidiaries that are included in the consolidated group as of 31 December 2018 and 2017 are listed in note 5.
b) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the Group's profit or loss and net assets attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests' share in the Group's net assets and consolidated comprehensive income for the year are disclosed separately in consolidated equity and in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired are recognised at the acquisition date at the proportional part of the fair value of the identifiable net assets.
Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When the percentage of equity held by minority interests changes, the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect changes in its relative interests in the subsidiary. The Group recognises directly in equity the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, and attributes this difference to the owners of the parent. The results attributed to the minority shareholder up to the acquisition date are recognised as results attributable to minority interests.
The Group evaluates if, in the contracts with non-controlling interests, there are clauses or financial instruments that may obligate the entity to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to settle it as a financial liability, in order to determine its classification and valuation.
When a financial instrument is classified in the consolidated financial statements, the entity takes into account all the terms and conditions agreed upon between the members of the Group and the holders of the instrument, in order to determine if the Group has an obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset in virtue of the instrument in question, or to settle it in such a way that entails classifying it as a liability. If there is an obligation or a settlement clause, the instrument is classified as a liability in the consolidated financial statements.
Sometimes these options depend on the occurrence of some future uncertain event that is outside the control of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument. If the issuer of this instrument also does not have the unconditional right to prevent the delivery of cash or another financial asset, it will be considered a financial liability for the issuer, unless the part of the clause regarding the contingent settlement that may require the settlement in cash or another financial asset is not feasible, i.e. it is extremely extraordinary, highly unusual and very improbable.
c) Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method for business combinations.
No business combinations took place in 2018 or 2017.
109

Consolidated Annual Accounts
d) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in financial and operating decisions, but not control or joint control. The Group is generally understood to exercise significant control when it holds more than 20% of voting rights.
The financial statements of associates are included in the consolidated annual accounts using the equity method. The Group's share of the profit or loss of an associate from the date of acquisition is recognised with a credit or debit to share in profit/loss of equity-accounted investees in the consolidated income statement for the year.
Losses of an associate attributable to the Group are limited to the value of its net investment, as the Group has not acquired any legal or constructive obligations.
The Group has no significant investments in associates.
e) Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Balances and transactions between Group companies and the resulting unrealised gains or losses with third parties are eliminated on preparing the consolidated annual accounts.
2.7 Translation differences
a) Functional and presentation currency The annual accounts of each Group company are expressed in the currency of the underlying economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The functional currency is the local currency for the majority of Group companies, with the exception of Bahru Stainless, NAS Canada and NAS Mexico, whose functional currency is the US dollar. The figures disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts are expressed in thousands of euros, the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.
b) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date, at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and recorded at historical cost are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. In the case of non-monetary assets belonging to countries considered hyperinflationary, at the end of each period the historical cost is revalued, applying a price index to express them in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the period. A detailed description of the valuation of items in hyperinflationary economies is included in section (c) below.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date on which fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary items measured at fair value are recorded as a part of the gain or loss on the fair value of the item.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows from foreign currency transactions have been translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates the cash flows occur.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation into the functional currency of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
c) Translation of foreign operations In preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than the euro have been translated to euros at the closing rate prevailing at the reporting date; income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period; and exchange differences are recognised separately in equity and in the statement of comprehensive income under translation differences. Translation differences are taken to profit and loss when the company that generates them ceases to form part of the Group.
The Group has applied the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, relating to accumulated translation differences. Consequently, translation differences recognised in the consolidated annual accounts generated prior to 1 January 2004 are recognised in retained earnings. Furthermore, the Group did not apply IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, retrospectively to goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS. Consequently, goodwill is considered as an asset of the acquirer, not the acquiree, and is therefore not subject to variations due to exchange rate fluctuations affecting the acquiree.
For presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows, including the comparative balances of foreign subsidiaries, are translated into euros applying the same criteria as that used to translate the financial statements.
d) Conversion of financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies Since 1 July 2018, Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy due to meeting the qualification requirements established in IAS 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina, as detailed in note 5.
110

The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy are expressed in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. Both the comparative figures for the previous period and the information relating to previous periods are restated only to the extent that they are significant for the Group, in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. Since most non-monetary items are carried at historical cost, the restated cost of each item is determined by applying to said historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period.
At the beginning of the first period of application of this Standard, the components of owners' equity, except retained earnings and revaluation surpluses, shall be restated by applying a general price index to the various items from the dates on which they were contributed or from the date they arose otherwise. The restated retained earnings shall be derived from the remaining amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. At the end of the first period and in subsequent periods, all components of equity shall be restated by applying a general price index from the beginning of the period, or from the date of contribution if later.
All items in the statement of comprehensive income are expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. To this end, all amounts shall be restated for the change in the general price index from the date on which income and expenses were recorded in the financial statements.
The gain or loss on the net monetary position will be included in profit or loss of the period.
In note 13.6 the impacts of the valuation according to this standard of the Financial Statements of Acerinox Argentina are included, after Argentina had been declared a hyperinflationary economy.
2.8 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the positive difference between the cost of acquisition and the Group's share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities) at the acquisition date.
The goodwill recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Acerinox Group mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless, Ltd. in 2002.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (or more frequently where there are indications of possible impairment) in accordance with IAS 36, if it has experienced impairment losses in its value. To this end, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) of the company that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. (See note 2.11). Impairment losses are recognised for a cash-generating unit when the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the Group's goodwill is allocated is determined based on its value in use. (See note 2.11)
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business combination is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement, after reassessing the measurement of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, as established in the standard.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
b) Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge is expensed in the consolidated income statement when incurred.
When research findings are applied to produce new products or to substantially improve existing products and processes, the associated development costs are capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and sufficient future cash flows are expected to be generated to recover the costs, with a credit to self-constructed non-current assets in the consolidated income statement. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
Expenditure on activities for which costs attributable to the research phase are not clearly distinguishable from costs associated with the development stage of intangible assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Capitalised development costs are not amortised while the project is underway. Upon successful completion of the project, amortisation begins on a systematic basis over the estimated useful life. In the event of changes in the circumstances that led to the capitalisation of the project expenditure, the unamortised balance is expensed in the year the changes arise.
c) Computer software Computer software licences are capitalised at the cost of acquiring the licence and preparing the specific program for use.
Computer software maintenance or development costs are charged as expenses when incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique computer software packages by the Group are recognised as intangible assets provided that they are likely to generate economic benefits that exceed the associated costs for more than one year. Capitalised expenses comprise direct labour costs and directly attributable overheads.
111

Consolidated Annual Accounts
d) Amortisation Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they become available for use. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
- Industrial property: 5 years - Computer software: 2-5 years The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Residual values, depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.
2.9 Property, plant and equipment
a) Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Items of property, plant and equipment that require a period of time in order to be ready for use are classified as under construction. An asset is understood to be ready for use when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. When in operation it is reclassified to the corresponding asset category, based on its nature. The cost of self-constructed assets is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset, while also considering the criteria applicable to production costs of inventories. The production cost is capitalised by allocating the costs attributable to the asset to self-constructed noncurrent assets in the consolidated income statement. Borrowing costs directly linked to financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost until the asset enters service. The Group also capitalises certain borrowing costs incurred on loans that are not directly designated to finance the investments, applying a capitalisation rate to the amounts used to finance these assets. This capitalisation rate is calculated based on the weighted average of the borrowing costs incurred on loans received by the Company other than those specifically allocated to finance the assets. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised never exceeds the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes major repair costs, which are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated period remaining until the following major repair. Subsequent to initial recognition of the asset and once it is ready for use, only improvement costs incurred which will generate probable future profits and for which the amount may reliably be measured are capitalised. Costs of periodic servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred. Spare parts are carried as inventory unless the Group expects to use them over more than one period, in which case they qualify as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over their useful life. The carrying amount of a spare part is written off when it is used to replace a damaged part. Spare parts of property, plant and equipment are classified under technical installations and machinery in the breakdown provided in note 8. Gains or losses on the sale or disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are recognised as operating income or expenses in the income statement.
b) Amortisation Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by allocating the depreciable amount of the asset on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost or deemed cost of an asset, less its residual value. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. Residual values, depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates. Land is not depreciated, unless the Group has acquired the right to use the land and related property for a specific number of years, in which case it is depreciated over the period of the right of use. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:
- Buildings: 14-50 - Technical installations and machinery: 3-30 - Other property, plant and equipment: 2-10
112

2.10 Investment property
Investment property comprises Group-owned buildings held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and subsequent sale but not occupied by the Group.
The Group only makes transfers to or from property, plant and equipment to investment property when there is a change in the use of the property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequently the Group applies the same criteria as for property, plant and equipment.
Lease income is recognised using the criteria described in note 2.20 b).
2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
At the end of each period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. The Group considers that indications of impairment exist when there is a significant decrease in the value of the asset, significant changes in the legal, economic or technological environment that could affect the valuation of assets, obsolescence or physical impairment, idle assets, low returns on assets, discontinuation or restructuring plans, repeated losses in the entity or substantial deviation from the estimates made. This means to that evaluate the existence of signs of impairment, both external sources of information (technological changes, significant variations in market interest rates, market values of assets, etc.) and internal sources (evidence of obsolescence, etc.) are considered.
The recoverable amount of goodwill, which is not amortised, and of intangible assets not yet available for use is estimated at each reporting date, unless prior to this date there were indications of a possible loss in value, in which case these are tested for impairment.
Impairment losses are recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset, or its corresponding cash-generating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are expensed in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated cash flows, applying a discount rate that reflects the current market valuation of the time value of money and the specific risks of the asset in question. For assets that do not generate cash inflows themselves, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, considered as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Details of the variables and assumptions used by the Group to calculate value in use and identify cash-generating units are provided in notes 7.1 and 8.1.
Except in the case of goodwill, impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed through the income statement provided that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. However, the new carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount (net of amortisation or depreciation) that the asset would have had if no impairment loss had been recorded.
2.12 Financial instruments
2.12.1 Classification The Group began applying the new IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.
The Group classifies financial instruments into different categories based on the nature of the instruments and the Group's intentions on initial recognition.
In accordance with the new standard, financial assets have been classified in one of the three main measurement categories: amortised cost at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value through profit or loss, based on the business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
In relation to financial liabilities there have been no changes with respect to the classification
2.12.2 Financial assets Acquisitions and disposals of investments are accounted for at the date on which the Group undertakes to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction costs, is recognised in profit or loss.
113

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The measurement criteria applied to the financial assets held by the Group in 2018 and 2017 are detailed below.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss In both 2018 and 2017, derivative financial instruments, except those that are designated as hedges and qualify for recognition as such, are included in this category.
The derivative financial instruments included in this category are classified as current assets and measured at fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised as an expense in profit and loss.
Changes in fair value are recorded under revaluation of financial instruments at fair value in the income statement.
b) Financial assets at amortised cost This category includes non-derivative financial assets which receivables are for a fixed or determinable amount and that are not traded in an active market. Specifically, this includes loans granted and accounts receivable. They are only classified as non-current when they are not due to mature within 12 months of the reporting date. These investments are initially recognised at the fair value that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, which is the same as the transaction price plus the costs directly attributable to the purchase, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group makes the necessary valuation adjustments according to an expected loss model. The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition. These losses are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement and are reversed with the recognition of the income in profit and loss when their causes are eliminated.
Trade receivables are included in this category, recognised at their nominal value, which is the same as their fair value, as generally they do not have a contractual rate of interest, are expected to be received in the short term and the effect of not discounting future receipts is not material. The amount of customers is reduced by the amounts not collected when due, calculated on the basis of the expected loss model, which takes into account the historical loss incurred and other external factors. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense in the income statement and are reversed when the factors leading to the allowance have ceased to exist. The reversal amount is credited to the income statement.
The Group has defined a new impairment loss model based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts at each of the subsidiaries and on the claims made under the arranged credit insurance policies, including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%-90% and deductibles), and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim, whether from the insurance company or the customers themselves. These estimates are reviewed within our credit risk control system (Commercial, Financial and Commercial Risk departments, Risk Committee as well as the Corporate Risk Management Department), which constantly monitors the particular markets of each subsidiary, receives the inputs of specialised experts from insurance companies, and reviews future estimates from international organisations of recognised prestige (IMF, OECD, etc.), also taking into account the macroeconomic estimates of each country. The Group takes into account and monitors the significant variations in credit risk that may occur during the term of the loans.
The Group has reviewed its policy on the basis of the new IFRS 9 applicable from 1 January 2018, as detailed in note 2.2.
Discounted notes and factored trade receivables are recognised until maturity under both trade receivables and current loans and borrowings, unless the risks and rewards associated with these assets have been substantially transferred, in which case they are derecognised.
The Group considers that it has transferred a financial asset when it has transferred the right to receive the cash flows derived from the asset; or it has retained those rights, but has assumed the contractual obligation to pay those assets to another entity. In this case, the Group also considers the different additional conditions established in the standard (it has no obligation to pay any amount to another entity, unless it receives the cash flows derived from the financial asset; it cannot sell or offer the transferred financial assets as collateral; and it has an obligation to pay the cash flows received without significant delay). If, in addition, the Group does not retain the risks and rewards of these assets, it will remove them from the balance sheet.
Most of the assignment contracts signed by the Group comply with this definition and are therefore removed from the balance sheet.
c) Financial assets at fair value with changes through other comprehensive income This classification includes those assets that under IAS 39 were called available-for-sale financial assets.
In accordance with the new valuation standard for financial instruments, investments in equity instruments to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, with the irrevocable election at initial recognition to present the changes at fair value through other non-recyclable comprehensive income, provided the instrument is not held for trading.
The Group has decided to include in this category, the investments in the capital of other companies over which the Group has no control or significant influence and which it is not holding for trading. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase. After initial recognition financial assets classified in this category are measured at fair value provided this can be measured reliably, recognising the gain or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of listed securities is determined by reference to the share price. The fair value of financial assets that are not quoted in official markets is calculated by reference to discounted future cash flows.
114

Equity investments included in this category whose market value cannot be reliably defined are measured at acquisition cost, less any impairment losses.
In the event of a sale of available-for-sale financial assets, the difference between the amount of the sale and its fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.12.3 Financial liabilities For measurement purposes, financial liabilities are classified into the following categories:
a) Financial liabilities at amortised cost This category includes the debits and items to be paid as well as the bonds issued by the Group.
It includes non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments. Debts and payables are initially recognised at cost, which is the same as their fair value, less any transaction costs incurred. These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between the amount received (net of transaction costs) and the amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss. However, trade payables falling due in less than one year that have no contractual interest rate and are expected to be settled in the short term are measured at their nominal amount.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when the obligation specified in the corresponding contract has been honoured or cancelled, or has expired.
When debt is refinanced, the Group assesses the significance of the modifications made to determine whether they are materially different and, therefore, the effects of the new agreement should be recorded as if it were a cancellation and, simultaneously, a new loan. The terms will be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows discounted under the new terms, including any net fees paid of any fees received, and using the original effective interest rate to calculate the discount, differs by at least 10 per cent from the discounted present value of the cash flows still remaining from the original financial liability. If an exchange of debt instruments or a modification of conditions is accounted for as a cancellation, the costs or commissions incurred will be recognised as part of the cancellation cost. If the aforementioned exchange or modification is not accounted for as a cancellation, the costs and commissions will adjust the carrying amount of the liability, and will be amortised over the remaining life of the modified liability.
The Group has contracted reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are recognised under trade and other payables until they are settled or repaid or have expired.
b) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss This category includes the Group's derivative financial instruments, except for financial guarantee contracts or designated accounting hedging instruments.
These are recognised at fair value. The amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability shall be presented in other comprehensive income. The remaining amount of the change in the fair value of the liability is presented through profit or loss for the period, unless this treatment would create an accounting asymmetry in profit or loss for the period, in which case all changes in fair value are recognised through profit or loss. In the Acerinox Group the only liabilities designated in this category are derivatives used to hedge fluctuations in the exchange rate. These are short-term financial instruments in which the variation attributed to credit risk is not significant.
2.12.4 Hedge accounting The objective of hedge accounting is to represent, in the financial statements, the effect of the Group's risk management activities in which financial instruments are used to cover exposures from derivative financial instruments that may affect the income statement for the year.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, which coincides with their fair value. They are subsequently recognised at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are classified and measured as financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Where derivatives qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges, they are treated as such and the recognition of any resultant unrealised gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedged item. The effective part of the realised gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and later transferred to the income statement in the year or years in which the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The Group takes into account the requirements established in the new standard (IFRS 9) to determine whether the hedging relationship meets the requirements to be designated as hedge accounting. In this regard, it takes into account whether the following conditions are met:
a) The hedging relationship consists only of hedging instruments and eligible hedged items.
b) A t the inception of the hedging relationship, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for performing the hedge.
115

Consolidated Annual Accounts
c) The hedging relationship meets all of the following hedging effectiveness requirements: i) There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. ii) Credit risk does not have a dominant effect on changes in value resulting from that economic relationship. iii) T he hedging ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the amount of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the amount of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that amount of the hedged item.
At the inception of the hedge the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationships and the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedges. The Group prospectively discontinues the accounting of fair value hedges when the hedging instrument expires, is sold or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. In these cases, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is recorded in profit or loss. The Group only undertakes cash flow hedges.
2.12.5 Measurement of fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified based on valuation inputs into the following levels: LEVEL 1: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices on active markets. LEVEL 2: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on observable market inputs, other than quoted prices. LEVEL 3: includes financial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs.
2.13 Inventories
Inventories are initially measured at cost of acquisition or production. Valuation allowances are made and recognised as an expense in the income statement when the cost of acquisition or production of inventories exceeds the net realisable value. The Group uses the same cost model for all inventories of the same nature and with a similar use. It uses the weighted average cost measurement method. Finished goods and work in progress are measured at the weighted average cost of raw and other materials consumed, incorporating applicable direct and indirect labour costs and general manufacturing costs based on the higher of normal operating capacity or actual production. The cost of underutilisation of operating capacity is not included in the value of finished goods and work in progress. Net realisable value is the expected selling price of these goods less costs to sell. In the case of work in progress the estimated costs of completion are also deducted from this price. Raw materials are not written down below cost if the finished goods in which they will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost of production. Any write-downs that reduce inventories to their net realisable value are reversed, up to the cost of the inventories, if the circumstances that gave rise to the write-downs cease to exist.
2.13.1 Emission allowances Pursuant to Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December 2016, the Group recognises CO2 emission allowances as inventories. As International Financial Reporting Standards do not specify how to classify emission allowances, the Group opted to harmonise the two policies by adopting similar classification criteria in both the individual and consolidated accounts. CO2 emission allowances are measured at cost of acquisition. Allowances acquired free of charge under the National Allocation Plan pursuant to Law 1/2007 of 9 March 2007 are initially measured at market value at the date received. At the same time, a grant is recognised for the same amount under deferred income. Emission allowances remain classified as inventories until surrendered. At year end, the Group assesses whether the carrying amount of the allowances exceeds their market value in order to determine whether there are indications of impairment. If there are indications, the Group determines whether these allowances will be used in the production process or earmarked for sale, in which case the necessary impairment losses would be recognised. These provisions are released when the factors leading to the valuation adjustment have ceased to exist. A provision for liabilities and charges is recognised for expenses related to the emission of greenhouse gases. This provision is maintained until the company is required to settle the liability by surrendering the corresponding emission allowances. These expenses are accrued as greenhouse gases are emitted.
116

When an expense is recognised for allowances acquired free of charge, the corresponding deferred income is taken to operating income.
In the case of swaps of emission allowances, given that all of the Group's allowances were acquired free of charge, the accounting treatment applied by the Group is that of non-commercial swaps. The Group derecognises allowances surrendered at their carrying amount and recognises those received at their fair value when received. The difference between both values is recognised as deferred income.
In note 10, detailed information on emission allowances received and consumed in 2018 and 2017 is included.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Group classifies interest paid and received as cash flows from operating activities, while dividends received are considered cash flows from investing activities and dividends paid are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.
2.15 Grants
2.15.1 Capital grants Capital grants are those received by the Group for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. They are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet. They are initially recognised at the original amount awarded when there is reasonable assurance that this will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached. Subsequently, they are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets for which the grants were received.
2.15.2 Operating grants Operating grants are those received to finance specific expenses. They are recognised as income as the expenses are incurred. Grants relating to CO2 emission allowances that are free of charge, are taken to income in line with the recognition of the corresponding greenhouse gas emission expense.
2.16 Employee benefits
Certain Group companies have assumed the following long-term commitments with their employees:
a) Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Certain Group companies pay contributions to pension and life insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are accrued. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Provisions are not made for defined contribution plans as they do not generate future obligations for the Group.
b) Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a commitment entered into by a company with its employees to remunerate services rendered. These benefits have been established based on local legislation in certain countries, contracts signed to that effect, or as included in collective bargaining agreements prevailing in certain Group companies. Accrued commitments are calculated as the present value of the accumulated benefits accrued by personnel until the reporting date, using actuarial assumptions. Calculations are made by independent experts. Group companies record the corresponding provisions to cover these commitments.
Existing obligations may be classified as:
· Pension plans: certain Group companies have commitments with some employees reaching retirement age. · Early retirement benefits: certain Group companies have undertaken to pay benefits to employees who opt to take early retirement. · Supplements: these plans are obligations agreed with certain Group employees to supplement their remuneration on retirement. · Other post-employment commitments: certain Group companies provide healthcare benefits to their retired employees. Entitlement to these
benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. The Group complies with obligations regarding the externalisation of these commitments in countries where this is applicable.
Defined benefit liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet reflect the present value of defined benefit obligations at the reporting date, minus the fair value at that date of plan assets. The Group recognises changes in the actuarial value of obligations in other comprehensive income.
117

Consolidated Annual Accounts
An independent expert calculates the actuarial value of commitments. The measurement is performed using the Projected Unit Credit method, taking into account mortality tables and estimated future increases in medical costs. When plan assets include insurance policies that exactly match the amount and timing of some or all of the benefits payable under the plan, the fair value of the insurance policies is considered equal to the present value of the related obligations.
c) Share-based payment transactions The Group applies standard IFRS 2, relating to share-based payments, to transactions settled with equity instruments, in which the company receives goods or services in exchange for shares in the parent company. The Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. held on 22 March 2018 approved a multi-year remuneration plan or long-term incentive (LTIP) plan that allows the Executive Director and Senior Executives of the Acerinox Group to receive part of their variable remuneration through the delivery of Acerinox, S.A.'s own shares. In note 15.1.3 detailed information on the characteristics of the approved plan is included. Since this is an equity-settled share-based payment transaction in which the equity instruments granted are not immediately irrevocable and become irrevocable when the other party completes a specified period of service, the Group recognises the services received on a straight-line basis over the period in which the rights to receive such shares become irrevocable, while recognising the corresponding increase in equity. The Group recognises the assets or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at fair value, on the date of the concession agreement for the equity instruments to be awarded. Fair value is determined by the market price of the entity's shares adjusted to take into account the terms and conditions under which those shares were granted (except for conditions for irrevocability or consolidation, other than market conditions, which are excluded from the determination of fair value,). For this, the Group uses the valuation of an independent expert. When the parent has an obligation to settle the transaction with the subsidiary's employees by providing the parent's own equity instruments, the parent shall measure its obligation as a contribution to its subsidiary. Therefore the parent will recognise an increase in the subsidiary's shareholding and the correspondent increase in equity, measured at the fair value on the date of the concession agreement. At the time the shares are delivered, the accounting difference between the equity item cancelled and the shares delivered is recognised against the reserves of the Parent Company.
2.17 Provisions
The Group recognises provisions when: (i) It has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events; (ii) It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account all risks and uncertainties surrounding the amount to be recognised as a provision and, where the time value of money is material, the financial effect of discounting provided that the expenditure to be made each period can be reliably estimated.
2.18 Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current
The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as current and non-current. Assets and liabilities are considered current when the Group expects to realise or settle them within 12 months after the reporting date or they are cash or cash equivalents.
2.19 Income tax
The income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated tax payable on the consolidated taxable income or tax loss for the year using prevailing tax rates enacted at the reporting date and applicable this year. Current tax includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method, based on temporary differences that arise between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated annual accounts. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates (and laws) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items previously charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Deferred tax liabilities are always recognised. Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income or deferred tax liabilities will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
118

Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer considered probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated or there are no deferred tax liabilities against which the assets can be offset. Reductions are offset if there is renewed expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available against which the derecognised balance can be utilised.
The Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so, the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under non-current assets or liabilities, irrespective of the expected date of recovery or settlement.
When inspecting procedures result in an assessment to be paid, the group generally recognises such amounts as a current expense for the amount payable, and a deferred tax expense for the change in assets or temporary difference liabilities arising from the assessments. In those cases in which there is no conformity with the amounts payable and the Group decides to lodge an appeal against the proceedings, considering furthermore that their result is highly probable to be favourable for the Group, the Group would recognise an asset for the amounts previously paid and which it estimates to be recovered.
Certain companies in the Consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to tax if distributed, since there are withholdings at source in certain legislation affecting the payment of dividends. The Group recognises any tax effect in this respect provided that it is not deemed likely that the reserves will have to be distributed in the foreseeable future, which will mean the reversal of the temporary difference. That is, when the parent entity has estimated that such gains will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, it does not recognise a deferred tax liability.
The Parent Company has filed consolidated tax returns since 1998. As agreed by the shareholders at an Annual General Meeting held on 28 May 2003, Acerinox, S.A. and some of the Spanish-domiciled subsidiaries form part of a consolidated tax group on an indefinite basis, with the exception of Metalinox Bilbao, S.A.U. and Inoxidables de Euskadi, S.A.U., which file tax returns separately. At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the consolidated tax group comprised: Acerinox, S.A., Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A., Inoxfil, S.A., Inoxcenter, S.L.U., and Inoxcenter Canarias, S.A.U.
2.20 Income
Revenue is an increase in economic benefits during the period in the form of additions or increases in the value of assets or decreases in liabilities that result in an increase in equity and are not related to owners' contributions.
Revenue represents the transfer of goods or services promised to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recognised when the customer obtains control of the good or service that has been sold, i.e. when they have the ability to direct the use of and obtain all of the benefits from the good or service.
The Group takes the five-step model into account to determine when revenue should be recognised and the amount.
1. Identify the contract with a customer 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract 3. Determine the transaction price 4. Allocate the price to the performance obligations 5. Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. There is no contract when each of the parties has the unilateral and enforceable right to terminate a completely non-executed contract without compensating the other party.
The Group's recurring or ordinary revenues relate mainly to:
a) Sales of goods and rendering of services Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return of goods. Sales proceeds are recognised at the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services promised to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. There is no contract when each of the parties has the unilateral and enforceable right to terminate a contract without compensating the other party. From this point of view, this analysis has revealed that orders arranged by the Group with customers do not give rise to an enforceable right or obligation, since the parties are entitled to unilaterally terminate a non-executed contract without compensating the other party up until the time the goods are delivered. Accordingly, no obligation comes into existence until the goods are delivered.
The Group takes the commercial terms of sale (INCOTERM) into account when determining the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods passes to the buyer.
119

Consolidated Annual Accounts
In determining the transaction price, the Group considers all of the following aspects: (a) variable consideration; (b) limitations on estimates of variable consideration; (c) existence of a significant financing component in the contract; (d) non-cash consideration; and (e) consideration for payments to be made to the customer.
Revenue is recognised net of taxes, returns and discounts that the Group considers probable at the date the revenue is recognised, and after the elimination of intra-Group sales.
b) Rental income Rental income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
c) Income from dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive it is established.
2.21 Environment
The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities. Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. However, where necessary, the Group recognises environmental allowances by applying the general criteria outlined in note 2.17. Property, plant and equipment acquired by the Group for long-term use to minimise the environmental impact of its activity and protect and improve the environment, including the reduction and elimination of pollution, are recognised as assets, applying the measurement, presentation and disclosure criteria described in note 2.9.
2.22 Changes in accounting estimates and policies, and correction of errors
The Group applies IAS 8 to recognise changes in accounting estimates and accounting policies and to correct errors. The Group recognises changes in accounting estimates in the period in which they occur. Accounting errors are corrected in the year in which they occurred, restating the comparative information presented in the financial statements whenever these errors are material. Policy changes are recognised retrospectively, adjusting the opening balances of the affected net equity items from the previous reporting year, unless there is a specific transitional provision for the initial application of a Standard or an Interpretation.
NOTE 3 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires that the Company's management make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and, therefore, the amounts reported in the annual accounts.
Accounting estimates and judgements are assessed constantly and based on past experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered reasonable. The Company may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and judgements related to future events. The resulting accounting estimates could differ from actual results. In accordance with IAS 8 on Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, changes in accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the Group's financial statements.
The Group's main estimates are as follows:
a) Impairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 2.11.
The Group reviews property, plant and equipment at each reporting date to ascertain whether there is any indication of impairment, taking into account the criteria set out in the policy. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined based on their value in use. These calculations are made using reasonable assumptions based on past returns and future production and market development expectations. Some of these assumptions relate to sales, margins, discount rates and growth rates to perpetuity, which involve a high degree of judgement. Details of the analyses conducted by the Group in 2018 and 2017 are included in notes 7.1 and 8.1.
120

b) Useful lives of plant and equipment Group management determines the estimated useful lives and corresponding depreciation charges for its plant and equipment based on expert valuations. These could alter significantly as a result of technical innovations, variations in plant activity levels, etc. Management regularly reviews the depreciation charge and adjusts it when estimated useful lives are different from those previously applied, fully depreciating or derecognising technically obsolete and non-strategic assets which have been abandoned or sold.
During the year, as in 2017, there has been a recalculation of useful lives in the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty), Ltd as explained in note 8.
c) Fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments The Group acquires derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in exchange rates and interest rates. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets is determined by using valuation techniques mainly based on market conditions existing at each reporting date, and provided that financial information is available to carry out this valuation. In note 11.2.4 there is additional information on financial instruments measured in accordance with these assumptions.
d) Provisions As mentioned in note 2.17, the provisions recognised in the consolidated balance sheet reflect the best estimate at the reporting date of the amount expected to be required to settle a liability, provided that the materialisation of this outflow of resources is considered probable. Changes in foreseen circumstances could affect these estimates, which would be revised if necessary.
In the case of provisions arising from litigation in which legal proceedings are pending, it is the lawyers or independent experts who determine the likelihood of occurrence of the events giving rise to the need to enter a provision. In those cases in which it is considered possible, although it is not probable that an outflow of resources will take place or it is difficult to determine reliably the amount of the provision, the Group will consider this to be a contingent liability and will disclose the information in the notes. (Note 15)
e) Net realisable value As mentioned in note 2.13, the Group estimates the net realisable value of its inventories to recognise any impairment required. Expected selling prices of inventories less costs to sell are considered when calculating net realisable value.
f) Determination of loan impairment based on expected loss criteria As mentioned in note 2.12.2, the Group has defined a new impairment loss model based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts at each of the subsidiaries and on the claims made under the contracted credit insurance policies, including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%-90% and deductibles), and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim, whether from the insurance company or the customers themselves. These estimates are reviewed within our credit risk control system (Commercial, Financial and Commercial Risk departments, Risk Committee as well as the Corporate Risk Management Department), which constantly monitors the particular markets of each subsidiary, receives the inputs of specialised experts from insurance companies, and reviews future estimates from international organisations of recognised prestige (IMF, OECD, etc.), also taking into account the macroeconomic estimates of each country. The Group takes into account and monitors the significant variations in credit risk that may occur during the term of the loans.
g) Adjustment for hyperinflation Since July 1, 2018, Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy by complying with the qualification requirements established in IAS 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina, as detailed in note 5.
The financial statements of Acerinox Argentina have been expressed in terms of the current unit of measurement at the end of the reporting period. The restated cost of each item in the financial statements is determined by applying to its historical cost of said items and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period.
In this year, which is first period of application of this Standard, the components of owners' equity, except retained earnings and revaluation surpluses, have been restated by applying a general price index to the various items from the dates on which they were contributed or from the date they arose otherwise. The restated retained earnings are the result of applying these indices to the remaining amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
All items in the statement of comprehensive income have also been expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. To this end, all amounts have been restated by applying an index calculated on the basis the change in the general price index from the date on which income and expenses were recorded in the financial statements.
The gain or loss on the net monetary position has been included in profit or loss.
In note 13.6 includes the impacts of the valuation according to this standard, which in any case have been immaterial to the Group.
121

Consolidated Annual Accounts
h) Recoverability of available tax loss carryforwards and deductions The Group regularly evaluates the recoverability of available tax credits through projections of profit and loss approved by management, to conclude as to whether they will be recoverable in the future.
The Group takes into account the limitations to offsetting tax loss carryforwards as stipulated in certain legislation. In note 18.3 details of the Group's existing tax credits and the bases used to determine the recoverability of capitalised tax credits are provided.
Based on the estimates made, the Group considers that the tax credits recognised are still recoverable within a reasonable time frame.
i) Recognition of deferred tax liability for investments in subsidiaries. As indicated in note 2.19, some companies in the consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to taxation if they were distributed. The Group recognises the tax effect of this item whenever it considers that it will be probable that it will be distributed and, therefore, considers that the associated temporary difference will be reversed in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group regularly evaluates the reserve repatriation needs of its subsidiaries. Based on the analysis made in 2017, and which is explained in note 18.3.1, the Group considered a repatriation of reserves by its subsidiaries in the amount of Euros 250 million. Hence, it has recognised the pertinent deferred tax liability. Following the revaluation carried out in this year, the Group and since the reserves for which the corresponding deferred tax liability was recognised have not yet been distributed, the Group considered it necessary to maintain the same amount. The Group does not consider it necessary to increase this amount since it does not consider it probable that any additional reserves will be distributed in the foreseeable future.
j) Evaluation of the impact of tax reform in the United States On 22 December 2017, a tax reform was approved in the United States that is applicable for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has evaluated the impact of the measures introduced by the reform and recognised in that year the effect the rate reduction had on deferred tax assets and liabilities. In note 18.1 a detailed explanation is given of the Group's analysis and of the possible impact of each of the measures introduced.
NOTE 4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group aims to minimise the potential adverse effects on its financial profits through the use of derivative financial instruments, where appropriate to the risks, and by taking out insurance policies. In note 11.2.6 there is a detailed analysis of the Group's derivative financial instruments at year end.
The Group does not acquire financial instruments for speculative purposes.
4.1 Market risk
Market risk arises from variations in market prices due to exchange rate or interest rate fluctuations or changes in the price of raw and other materials, which can affect either the company's resultos or its equity as well as the values of its assets and liabilities.
4.1.1 Currency risk The Group operates internationally and in various currencies, in particular the US dollar, and is therefore exposed to variations in exchange rates. Currency risk arises from commercial transactions, financing and investment operations, and from the translation of financial statements in functional currencies other than the Consolidated Group's presentation currency (euros).
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date, at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange rate differences that may arise from translation are recognised in the income statement. To avoid fluctuations in the income statement due to changes in exchange rates, and to ensure the expected cash flows, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge most of its financial and commercial transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each country. To this end, at the beginning of each month and subject to fortnightly review, each company considers its loans in non-local currency, trade receivables and supplier balances in foreign currency, the sales and purchases in foreign currency forecast for the period and forward exchange rate derivatives. The Group may take commercial and financial transactions as a whole into account when evaluating its total exposure for the purpose of hedging transactions in foreign currency. The Group hedges balances with third parties and between Group companies.
Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates that could affect assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency would be offset by a change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. Changes in the derivative are recorded in the income statement, offsetting any changes that occur in foreign currency monetary items.
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group to hedge this risk consists on forward exchange rate of either sales or purchases, negotiated by the Group's Treasury Department in accordance with policies approved by the Management.
122

The Group also uses, if necessary, other types of derivatives such as cross-currency swaps to control currency risk in financing operations. At yearend there were no derivatives contracts of this type, since there was no debt in a currency other than the functional currency.

The majority of the forward exchange rate derivatives negotiated by the Group do not meet the requirements to be considered cash flow hedging instruments and, therefore, to be recognised in accordance with the policy established in note 2.12.4. Financial instruments that do not comply with these policies have been accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

In general, financial instruments designated to hedge exposure to currency risk arising from commercial transactions are not recognised as hedging instruments. However, if they were to be, they would be those intended to hedge financing operations with credit institutions.

The fair value of forward exchange rate contracts is their market price at the reporting date, which is the present value of the difference between the negotiated price and the forward price of each contract.

In note 11.2.6, there is a detailed analysis of the financial instruments arranged by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2018 and 2017.

Lastly, the Group is exposed to currency risk as a result of the translation to euros of the individual financial statements of companies whose functional currency differs from the Group's presentation currency, particularly the US dollar and the South African rand. The USD-euro exchange rate at 2017 year end was 1.1993, while at 2018 year end it stood at 1.1450 (USD appreciation of 4.5% for the year). The exchange rate of the South African Rand to the Euro at 2017 year end was 14.8054, while at the end of this year it was 16.4594 (Rand depreciation of 11.2%).

The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign investments in currencies other than the euro, since these are strategic long-term investments that the Group does not intend to sell or liquidate. In note 13.4 a breakdown of the changes in translation differences during the year is included.

Based on the conversion exchange rates of these currencies against the euro at the end of 2018 and 2017 respectively, sensitivity to changes in exchange rates, with other variables remaining constant, is as follows:

4.1.2 Interest rate risk
The Group's financing comes from various countries and in different currencies (mainly in euro, US dollar and South African rand), with a range of maturity dates and mostly variable interest rates.

The Group's financial liabilities and financial assets are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. To manage this interest rate risk, curves are analysed regularly and on occasion derivatives may be used. These derivatives take the form of interest rate swaps and qualify for recognition as cash flow hedging instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account interest and exchange rates at that date and the credit risk associated with the swap counterparties.

As in 2017, during 2018 the Group has continued to reduce the cost of its long-term loans by renegotiating their reference interest rate. This is in addition to the fact that the Group has also extended the maturity of a substantial portion of its long-term loans by increasing the notional amounts and also reducing the costs thereof.

In 2018, in order to reduce the risk of changes in the variable interest rate, the Group arranged interest rate derivatives amounting to 250 million euros, equivalent to the amount of the new loans arranged with Banca March, Caixabank, ICO and BEI. In addition, a new fixed-rate loan contract was signed for 125 million euros.

With regard to 2017, the Group increased the amount of financing with a fixed interest rate, mainly as a result of signing three long-term, fixed-rate financing contracts: a loan of 50 million euros with Banca March transferred to a securitisation fund upon signing, another for 50 million euros with BBVA and a final loan of 120 million euros with Banco Popular. In turn, the volume of interest rate derivatives has reduced, however, as no interest rate hedging instrument was arranged in 2017 and some of the existing ones matured partially during the year.

123

Consolidated Annual Accounts
In note 11.2.6 there is a detailed analysis of the financial instruments arranged by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2018 and 2017.
Regarding the Group's interest rate sensitivity, had interest rates on the outstanding debt from financing at year end been 100 basis points higher, with all other variables remaining constant, the Group's consolidated profit after tax would have been 7.23 million euros lower due to a higher finance cost on variable-rate debt (6.87 million euros lower in 2017). The effect on the Group's equity of higher interest rates across the entire curve would have been an increase of 5.29 million euros (whereas there would have been a decrease of 6.46 million euros in 2017), as the higher borrowing costs would have been completely offset by positive variations in the values of its interest rate hedging derivatives held at the reporting date.
4.1.3 Price risk The Group is exposed to two types of price risk:
1. Risk due to changes in the listed price of securities held in listed companies.
The risk of price fluctuations in listed securities relates to the shares held by the Group in Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited. The Group has not hedged this risk with derivative financial instruments. In this first year of application of the new IFRS 9, the Group has designated these instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. The impact of the fluctuations in listed securities during the year is explained in note 11.2.5.
2. Risk of changes in prices of raw materials
Stainless steel is an iron alloy with a minimum chromium content of 10.5%, which also contains other metals such as nickel or molybdenum to give it specific properties. Due to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials used in the manufacturing process, as both Nickel and Molybdenum are listed on the London Metal Exchange, stainless steel prices can be very volatile, as these fluctuations are passed on to the customer in the selling price.
The cost of raw materials, of which nickel accounts for approximately 40%, is approximately 70% of the total production cost. The price setting strategy is therefore one of the most critical functions and requires significant knowledge of the market. In Europe, South Africa and the United States, sale prices comprise a base price and a variable component known as the alloy surcharge. The alloy surcharge is a mathematical formula, calculated monthly by each of the market's stainless steel producers, that takes into account the variation in the price of certain raw materials (particularly nickel, chromium and molybdenum) and fluctuations in the EUR-USD exchange rate. The application of this alloy surcharge means that the change in nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange during production of the order, as well as fluctuations in the price of other raw materials and the EUR-USD exchange rate, can be passed on to customers. This natural hedge is applied to 90% of the Group's sales (Europe, America and South Africa).
The productive process is planned on the basis of the existing customer backlog. The Group's manufacturing period is 15 days, allowing it to link the cost of raw materials with the selling price to the customer through the aforementioned alloy surcharge. Keeping strict control over inventories and adapting production to market circumstances help to alleviate the risk of raw material price fluctuations.
The stainless steel market is characterised by healthy demand, which has grown at an annual rate of approximately 6% for over 50 years. Exceptionally, the market shrank by 11.8% in 2007-2009 because of the worldwide economic recession, but recovered with growth of 26.4% in 2010. The aforementioned annual growth rate is therefore expected to prevail in the medium term. Stainless steel is required for all industrial applications and used in all sectors, which guarantees that this growth will be sustained in the coming years. Although end consumption continues to grow steadily, the fact that this market is largely controlled by independent wholesalers leads to volatility in apparent consumption, reflecting their expectations regarding nickel price trends in the London Metal Exchange (LME) and their ensuing strategies to stockpile or realise inventories.
Fluctuations in the price of nickel also affect consumer demand. Reductions in the price of nickel tend to go hand in hand with short-term drops in demand. Conversely, a rise in nickel prices tends to go hand in hand with higher demand. To counter the risk derived from the fact that independent wholesalers control the majority of the market, the policy followed by Acerinox's Group has developed a sales network that enables it to supply end customers on a continuous basis, by means of warehouses and service centres through which the Group's production is channelled. This policy has enabled the Group to achieve a significant market share among end customers and, therefore, stabilise sales and reduce this risk.
Maintaining sufficient inventory levels in warehouses entails the risk that these inventories might be recognised above their market price. The Group alleviates this risk by maintaining strict control over inventory levels.
The valuation of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods at average cost also helps to reduce the volatility of costs and, consequently, to decrease the impact of nickel price fluctuations on margins.
The aforementioned factors (an own sales network, controlled inventory levels, alloy surcharges, average cost valuations, shortening of the production cycle and a policy of acceptance of short-term orders) help to reduce exposure to the main risk, namely the cyclical nature of apparent consumption due to the volatility of raw materials. As this is a factor beyond the Group's control, effective risk management is not always sufficient to eliminate its impact.
124

In 2018 the factors that have influenced sales prices has not come marked by raw materials fluctuations and its resulting cyclical effect in apparent consumption, but because of tariff barriers in different markets, which have affected import flows in different markets, mainly in Europe.
On 18 July the European Commission announced provisional safeguard measures on imports of a number of steel products, including stainless steel. These measures were intended to protect the European Union market from the diversion of steel from other countries as a result of recently imposed US tariffs (Section 232), by imposing tariffs of 25%. These provisional measures entered into force on 19 July and generated the opposite effect to that intended, provoking a call effect and acceleration of imports, which in 2018 reached 30%, the highest ever market share. This excess of available material has triggered a fall in prices in European markets. We expect a balance standardization between supply and demand due to the reaction adopted by the European Union.
On 2 February 2019 the definitive measures came into force, which, fortunately correct the previous ones, establishing quotas per country for the main importers, and quarterly quotas for the rest, which will be in force until 30 June 2021. These quotas are based on the average of imports for the period 2015-2017, and represent, from the beginning, a correction of several percentage points over the level of imports reached in 2018.
4.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the possible loss that could be incurred through failure of a customer or debtor to meet contractual obligations.
The Group's exposure to credit risk is determined by the individual characteristics of each customer and, where applicable, by the risk corresponding to the country where the customer operates. Due to the diversity of its customers and the countries in which it operates, the Group's credit risk is not concentrated in any individual customer, sector or geographical region.
The Group's policy is to hedge its commercial and political risks either through credit insurance companies, or through letters of credit and bank guarantees extended by banks of recognised solvency located in countries with low financial risk. Credit insurance covers between 85% and 90% of declared commercial risks, depending on the country in which the customer is located and the insurance company, and 90% of political risks. The Group's main credit insurer has an A2 credit rating from Moody's and an "A excellent" rating from A.M. Best.
In 2018 payouts of 1.837 thousand euros have been collected under the credit insurance policy (462 thousand euros in 2017).
A risk committee is responsible for monitoring the Group's credit risk policy. New customers are analysed with and assigned a risk cover by the insurance company, which enables the Group to offer its general payment terms to those that fulfil the necessary credit conditions. Where required, the risk committee also performs an individual analysis of customers' creditworthiness, establishing credit limits and payment terms. Payment in cash is required from those that do not.
The risk committee comprises representatives from the sales, financial and legal departments. The risks of the companies that make up the Acerinox Group are analysed and information is in turn received from the respective risk committees of Bahru Stainless, Columbus, North American Stainless or Grupinox (which represents the sales network in Spain).
Among other duties, the risk committee reviews the status of past-due debts, monitors sales with excessive exposure, and approves internal loans or, depending on the amount, requests approval from the steering committee.
The Group has long-standing commercial relationships with many of its customers. In the event of a late payment, the Group monitors future deliveries and payment terms closely, reviews credit limits and improves existing measures as appropriate.
Where permitted under local legislation in the country in which the customer operates, retention of title clauses are used to secure recovery of goods in the event of default on payment.
On occasion the Group also uses other financial instruments to reduce credit risk, such as factoring operations. The Group derecognises factored assets when the risks and rewards of these assets have been substantially transferred.
The Group makes the valuation adjustments to the trade receivables deemed necessary based on an expected impairment loss model based on an analysis of the average insolvencies in each of the subsidiaries and on the claims incurred on the credit insurance policies taken out, as detailed in note 2.2.
In note 11.2.1 there is a detailed analysis of movement in impairment of trade receivables are provided.
At 31 December 2018, consolidated trade receivables amount to 524,695 thousand euros (552,058 thousand euros in 2017). Revenues for 2018 total 5,010,777 thousand euros (4,626,855 thousand euros in 2017).
Credit risk insurance has been contracted for 52% of consolidated net sales (55% in 2017). Cash conditions exist for 1% (2% in 2017). Confirmed letters of credit or guarantees are used to hedge credit risk in 3% of consolidated net sales (3% in 2017). Domestic sales by North American Stainless Inc., which entail a very low risk due to the collection period of under 30 days, account for 39% of consolidated net sales (37% in 2017), allowing deliveries to be controlled and reducing any impairment losses.

Most of the Group's past-due receivables are insured and generally reflect customary delays in trading activity (the 77%of past-due receivables are aged less than 30 days). At 18 February 2019, over 88% of the above past-due debt has been collected (85% in 2017).

In view of the default rates in all sectors, we consider that the above figures are highly satisfactory and indicate the success of the Group's commercial credit risk policy.

Any advances to suppliers of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets are hedged through bank guarantees issued by the supplier and confirmed by banks of recognised solvency.

With regard to the credit risk of bank's accounts balance, only banks and financial institutions that are rated by an independent third party and with at least `Ba1' credit rating from Moody's are accepted. The Group has no significant concentration of risks as the likelihood of a default by the banks and financial institutions that are thus authorised is remote, based on their high credit ratings.

4.3 Liquidity risk
The Group is primarily financed through the cash flows generated in its operations, in addition to loans and financing facilities.
Although access to liquidity has improved considerably over the last two years, the Group ensures its liquidity and flexibility through long-term loans and financing facilities for amounts exceeding the quantities required at any time.
The Group's cash is centrally managed to optimise resources. The Group's net debt is primarily concentrated within the Parent Company (more than 95% of total gross borrowings at year end).
Based on its cash flow estimates and considering its investment plans, the Group has sufficient funding to meet its commitments, and maintains sufficient balances available for drawdown from credit facilities to cover liquidity risk. In 2018 and 2017 no payment defaults occurred on the principal of loans or loan interest on the Group's financing.
At year end the Group has been granted current and non-current financing totalling 1,903 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. 1,402 million euros has been drawn down from financing facilities at 31 December 2018 and 152 million euros from factoring facilities. In 2017, the Group had current and non-current financing facilities of 1,964 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. Drawdowns from financing facilities amounted to 1,230 million euros and drawdowns from factoring facilities amounted to 150 million euros. At 31 December 2018 cash and cash equivalents amount to 850 million euros (621 million euros in 2017).
The high levels of bank borrowings to guarantee mid-term liquidity along with the ongoing effort to reduce working capital continues to lead to high levels of cash in the Group. The cash balances are available and there is no restriction on their use.
Cash deposits are always short-term ­ never exceeding three months ­ and with banks of recognised solvency.
In addition, the Group continually monitors the maturity of its financial debt, seeking to establish the longest possible maturities.
The most significant financing operations during 2018, were the renegotiation of much of the existing debt and the arrangement of new loans, for the purpose of debt rescheduling and to reduce costs. The total volume of these operations was 405 million euros, and they include operations relating to existing and new loans. The existing ones include improvements in the economic conditions of Banca March, Abanca, Caixabank, Kutxabank and Banco Sabadell. As for the new ones, a 100 million euro loan contract has been signed with the Spanish Official Credit Institute ("ICO"). Details of these financing operations are provided in note 11.2.3.

126

During 2017, a renegotiation of a large part of the existing debt was also carried out, as well as the signing of new loans, with the same objective as that established for 2018. The total volume of these operations was 725 million euros, which included operations relating to existing loans as well as new ones. Among the existing loans were those with Banco de Sabadell, Banco Santander, Bankia, Banco Popular and Bankinter. In terms of new loans, loan agreements were signed with Banca March, Banco Social de Crédito Cooperativo, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and the European Investment Bank. The aggregate amount of these latter four loans totalled 210 million euros.

Payables to public entities are not included in "suppliers and other payables". The item "other current financial liabilities" mainly relates to advances on grants, deposits and guarantees, whose maturity is indeterminate. Future cash flow maturities include the loan principal plus interest based on contractual interest rates at year end. This item does not include approved investments not capitalised under property, plant and equipment under construction at the reporting date.

4.4 Brexit
Regarding the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Acerinox Group does not believe that this will have any impact on its financial statements, as the Group only has one distribution subsidiary there and it has no productive assets in that country. The subsidiary imports the material that is manufactured in any of the Group's manufacturing plants and sells it in the country. The total amount of fixed assets that the Group has in that country is 7.3 million euros (with the Group's total fixed assets being 2,136 million euros). Furthermore, the sales made in that country only represent 2% of the Group's total sales. Any flight of customers that may occur as a result of Brexit should not lead to a decrease in the Group's sales, as they can be offset in any other country, given that it is a global market.

4.5 Capital management
The aims of the capital management policy are:
- To safeguard the Company's capacity for sustained growth - To provide appropriate returns to shareholders - To maintain an optimum capital structure
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on changes in economic circumstances. To maintain and adjust its capital structure, it can adopt different policies relating to the payment of dividends, the reimbursement of the share premium, share buy-backs, self-financing of investments, non-current borrowings, etc.

127

Consolidated Annual Accounts
Capital structure is controlled using different ratios, such as the net financial debt/EBITDA ratio, understood to be the period necessary for the resources generated by the Company to cover the level of debt; or the gearing ratio, i.e. the relationship between net financial debt and equity of the Company.
Net financial debt is taken to be the sum of current and non-current loans and borrowings, plus notes issued, less cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA reflects operating profit or loss before amortisation, depreciation and changes in trade provisions which comprise a decrease of 1.573 thousand euros.
The ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA is 1.15x (1.25x in 2017), which continues to improve and has fallen by 39% since 2016. This is the best figure achieved since 2004.
The Group is well within the limits stipulated in the covenants governing Group borrowings, as detailed in note 11.2.3.
During the year, after the investments paid for 155.3 million euros (184.6 million euros in 2017), which are detailed in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from investment activities, a cash flow of 171.1 million euros was generated, lower than the 181.3 million euros obtained in 2017. Despite the improvement in pre-tax results of 310.0 million euros (298.6 million euros in 2017), working capital increased by 87.7 million euros (decrease of 0.6 million euros in 2017), mainly due to the higher prices experienced in the year (inventories were reduced in physical units), as well as raw materials. Net financial debt, which amounts to 552.1 million euros, is down by 9.4% with respect to the prior year (609.2 million euros).
The gearing ratio of 26.0% is the lowest since 2002 (22.2%).
The strategy followed during the year focused on optimising the cost of financing, taking advantage of existing liquidity in the markets, extending maturities and increasing debt at a fixed rate in the face of expected increases. Net financial expenses were reduced during the year, 2.1 million, 89% compared to 2017 (19.3 million euros).
As remarked in note 11.2.3., the most significant financing transaction in 2018 was the signing with the Spanish Official Credit Institute ("ICO") of an eight-year 100 million euro loan with a two-year grace period. The loan was awarded to Acerinox S.A. and the Group has undertaken to maintain, over the life of the loan, an annual financial compliance ratio between its consolidated net financial debt and its equity.
Meanwhile, the loan of 70 million euros that Acerinox S.A. signed with the European Investment Bank ("EIB") in December 2017 was delivered in June.
Lastly, and taking advantage of good market conditions, Acerinox S.A. has renegotiated five existing loan contracts with Abanca, Banca March, Caixabank, Kutxabank and Banco Sabadell, for a total amount of 305 million euros, improving costs and margins and extending terms.
The volume of investments continues to be in line with the Group's strategic plan. The Group did not base its 2008-2020 strategic plan, which has been revised for the 2016-2020 period, on opportunistic criteria, but rather on industrial rationale and long-term efficiency, meaning that, if its financial position permits this, the Group can keep to this plan even when the economic climate is unfavourable.
The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on 10 May 2018 approved the distribution of a dividend of 0.45 euros/share in cash, which was paid on 5 July. This amount means maintaining the same remuneration since 2006, either as a cash dividend or a flexible dividend (2013 to 2016 period). The share capital of Acerinox, S.A. remains at 276,067,543 shares.
4.6 Insurance
As the Group's three integrated flat product production plants, one cold rolling plant and three long product production plants are located in different regions, an accident would not affect more than one-third of total production. This guarantees the continuity of the business, while adequate co-ordination between the remaining factories reduces the consequences of material damage to any of the facilities.
Sufficient coverage has been contracted for the Group's factories through material damage and loss-of-profit insurance policies, which account for over 57.6% of the Acerinox Group's insurance expenditure. All assets under construction are covered by both the insurance policies taken out by the respective suppliers in addition to a global building and assembly policy.
The Group also has a reinsurance company based in Luxembourg, Inox Re, which manages these risks by assuming a part as self-insurance and accessing the reinsurance market directly.
The Acerinox Group has also arranged general liability, environmental, credit, transport, and group life and accident insurance policies to reduce its exposure to these different risks.
128

NOTE 5 - CONSOLIDATED GROUP

5.1 Subsidiaries and associates
At 31 December 2018 and 2017, in addition to Acerinox, S.A., the Acerinox consolidated group includes 38 fully consolidated subsidiaries. The Group decided in 2017 to consolidate the associate Betinoks Paslanmaz Çelik, A.S., as this company has been inactive since 2012. The financial statements of the associate were accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts with the equity method.

HOLIDING COMPANY ACERINOX S.A

5.2 Changes in the consolidated group
On December 2018 the Group acquired an additional 30% interest in the Group Company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd, of its shareholder Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd, to date also a minority shareholder of the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd by Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation and the restructuring of the Japanese Group, and according to an option under the Joint Venture Agreement dated 15th January 2009, between Nisshin Steel Co.Ltd and Acerinox, S.A., the latter has acquired 30% shareholding of Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd previously held by Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. for a total amount of 11.9 million dollars. (10.5 million euros), equivalent to the carrying amount of the shareholding, on the latest audited accounts. This acquisition increases Acerinox, S.A.'s stake in Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. to 97%.
The Group has derecognised the 30% non-controlling interest in this Company. The difference between the amount recognised under noncontrolling interests and the acquisition value paid was recognised against consolidated reserves amounting to -40,646 thousand euros.
There were no other changes in the scope of consolidation during the year.
In 2017 the only significant change to the consolidated group was the liquidation of the Group company Acerinox Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. This company had been inactive since 2013, when the boards of directors of Acerinox, S.A. decided to restructure the Group's sales network in Southeast Asia by merging the following trading companies in Malaysia: Acerinox S.C. Malaysia and Acerinox Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. As a result, Acerinox, S.A. sold Acerinox S.C Malaysia its interest in Acerinox Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. and at the same time, Acerinox S.C Malaysia assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Acerinox Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. Malaysian law has required the Company to be kept inactive during this period, up until its final liquidation. The impact of this liquidation on consolidated profits was revenue of 593 thousand euros from cumulative translation differences in this company, taken to profit and loss. The profit from the liquidation was recognised under finance income in the consolidated income statement.
Furthermore, Acerinox, S.A acquired a 5% interest in the Group company Acerinox Russia, L.L.C from the subsidiary company Acerinox Scandinavia, A.B., for 3 thousand euros. With this transaction, the Company from the Group in Russia is now wholly owned by the Parent Company Acerinox, S.A.

132

5.3 Capital increases and reductions
The following capital increases or reductions took place during the year:
Peru During the year a capital increase of 256 thousand euros was carried out in the Group company Corporación Acerinox Perú, S.A.C. This company was incorporated in 2012 with a share capital composed of 120,001 shares of 1 Peruvian sol with a nominal value each (58 thousand euros). The accumulated losses of 111 thousand euros and the increase in activity have made the capital increase necessary.
Inoxplate The Group company Inoxplate, Lda with headquarters in Portugal, a wholly owned investee of the Portuguese company Acerol, Ltda has reimbursed the supplementary contributions to its parent for the amount of 1 million euros.
There were no capital increases or reductions in any of the Group's companies during 2017.
5.4 Impairment of investments
At 31 December 2018 and 2017 the Parent Company has analysed the recoverability of its investments in Group companies with indications of impairment to determine whether their carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. Following the analyses carried out this year, the Parent has only recognised impairment on its investment in the company Bahru Stainless, Sdn. Bhd.
During the year, the Parent Company has recognised impairment of 155,454 thousand euros on its investment in the company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd., because its recoverable amount, calculated on the basis of discounted expected cash flows, is lower than its carrying amount. At 31 December 2018, this investment has been recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox, S.A. at 26,917 thousand euros, which is equal to its recoverable amount.
During 2017, the Parent Company recognised impairment of 7,288 thousand euros on its investment in the company Acerinox SC Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., because its recoverable amount, calculated on the basis of discounted expected cash flows, is lower than its carrying amount. At 31 December 2017, this investment was recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox, S.A. at 19,475 thousand euros, which was equal to its recoverable amount.
Details of the carrying amounts of investments in Group companies are included in note 5.1.
This impairment does not have an impact on consolidated results as these companies are fully consolidated. There is a detailed breakdown of the analyses performed in the Parent Company's individual report.
NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING
As described below, the Group is organised internally into operating segments, which are strategic business units. The strategic business units have different products and services and are managed separately. Group management reviews internal reports for each unit at least monthly.
The operating segments presented by the Group, associated with the types of products it sells, are as follows:
· Flat stainless steel products: slabs, flats, coils, plates, sheets, circles and flat bars. · Long stainless steel products: bars, angles, wires and wire rods. · Other: other stainless steel products not included in the previous segments.
The "unallocated" segment reflects the activities of the holding company and activities that cannot be allocated to specific operating segments. As described in note 1, the main activity of the holding company, parent company of the Acerinox Group, is the provision of legal, accounting and advisory services to all Group companies, as well as the performance of financing activities within the Group, as it is through Acerinox, S.A where all the Group's financing is centralised.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include all items directly or indirectly attributable to a segment. No significant assets are shared between segments and, considering the importance of flat stainless steel products, any assets that could be attributed to both segments are assigned to the flat segment.
With regard to the so-called "unallocated" segment, which relates mainly to the holding company's own activities, the result reflects only the expenses corresponding to its activities, since revenues, as they are always with Group companies, have been eliminated in consolidation. Costs are mainly financial since the holding company centralises most of the Group's financing, as can be seen from the amount of the liabilities in the "unallocated" segment.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Revenue and all items reflected in the income statement by segments are presented on a consolidated basis, i.e. after eliminating income and expenses from Group companies, except for sales between segments, which are reflected separately.
Inter-segment sales prices are established in accordance with market commercial terms and conditions governing non-related third parties.
A segment's performance is measured by its gross operating profit and net profit before tax. The Group considers this information to be the most relevant in evaluating a segment against other comparable segments in the sector.

The research and development expenses incurred by the Group do not meet the criteria for capitalisation and are therefore recognised as expenses, by type, when they are incurred. Research and development and innovation (R&D&I) costs directly recognised as expenses for the year and taken to the income statement amount to 9,547 thousand euros (13,597 thousand euros in 2017).

At 31 December 2018, the Group has enter into contracts for the acquisition of intangible assets amounting to 970 thousand euros, (0 in 2017).

7.1 Goodwill impairment testing
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill on an annual basis, or more frequently where there are indications of possible impairment. To this end, goodwill is allocated to the company's cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination.

137

Consolidated Annual Accounts

At 31 December 2018, goodwill totals 69 million euros and mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless, Ltd. in 2002. This goodwill has been allocated to the Columbus cash-generating unit (CGU), which manufactures and sells flat products only.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on its value in use. These calculations are based on cash flow projections from the financial budgets approved by management over a period of ten years. Cash flows beyond this ten-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates indicated below. A period of ten years is considered to try to reflect the fluctuations of the stainless steel market, replicating upward and downward cycles based on the observation of past price fluctuations, eliminating the effect of raw material price volatility. The terminal value is calculated considering the average of the budgeted period eliminating the maximum and minimum estimated values. This reduces the weighting of the terminal value in the overall calculation of the value in use and normalises the probability of occurrence of the hypotheses used in preparing the budgets.

Forecast volumes of sales and production are based on the current capacities of existing machinery and equipment. Management determined budgeted gross margins based on past experience and forecast market performance. The weighted average growth rates are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used are pre-tax values and reflect specific risks related to the relevant segments. Other significant assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values.

In 2018 Columbus Stainless, Ltd recorded a pre-tax profit of ZAR 165.39 million compared to ZAR 624.95 million in 2017. These figures reflect the negative progress in the markets, especially in the last quarter of the year. During the first months of 2018, the final demand for steel performed well in all markets, in line with the good progress of the world economy. It was also characterised by the uncertainties generated by trade tensions which, together with the measures adopted by the different countries, affected the trade flows of stainless steel.

The South African economy grew again in 2018, albeit at a slower pace than expected. Apparent consumption of stainless steel in South Africa recovered to average levels in recent years, helped by the upturn in demand in key sectors such as the automotive and tank container industry and improving Columbus sales in the domestic market although there was also an increase in imports.

The Company is confident that the flows to perpetuity will materialise, mainly in terms of its use of production capacity and margins, while still applying prudent criteria to the growth rates (g) used. The growth rates have been calculated using estimated growth rates for the country and sector, and bearing in mind historical growth in the consumption of stainless steel.

The key assumptions used to calculate value in use are as follows: 2018

2017

Budgeted EBIT margin (*) Weighted average growth rate (**) Discount rate applied (***)

4.5% 2.5% 13.1%

5.8% 2.5% 12.5%

(*) EBIT margin, considered equivalent to operating profit/loss (as a percentage of net revenue). Average value of the budgeted period. (**) Used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period. (***) WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital

The discount rate applied (weighted average cost of capital or WACC) is 13.1%. It is calculated taking as reference the interest rates on South African sovereign debt (ten-year swap on the South African rand), market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.

Regarding the calculation of the terminal value, as commented previously, it is calculated considering the average of the budgeted period eliminating the maximum and minimum estimated values, the amortisations are equal to the investments and the variation of the working capital is also calculated on the normalised average, understood as consistent in the long term, increased by the growth rate (g).

The growth rate (g) remains constant at 2.5%. In 2018 the global stainless steel market continued to consolidate the historical market growth rate of 5.5% for the 1950-2018 period.

The Company's budgets reflect these factors, as well as a gradual increase in sales to Bahru Stainless, Sdn Bhd as the Malaysian factory achieves higher utilisation of its present installed production capacity.

Other assumptions are the euro-rand exchange rate (16.459) and the price of raw materials (11,200 USD/MT), which are established when drawing up the budget. Both assumptions are extrapolated applying very conservative criteria and are held constant over the period analysed. The variables used in 2017 were a euro-rand exchange rate of 14.805 and a raw materials price of 11,200 USD/MT.

The impairment test performed at 31 December 2018 reveals an excess of recoverable value over the carrying amount of 76.1 thousand euros (168.8 million in 2017, considering 100% of the assets, not only the part corresponding to Acerinox's stake in Columbus). The discount rate (WACC), the growth rate (g) and the budgeted EBIT margin are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.

Following a sensitivity analysis entailing different scenarios, impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 28.8% (42% in 2017). In the case of the growth rate (g), even with a growth rate of 0%, the discount rate (WACC) would have to increase by 25.8% (35.1% in 2017) for the carrying amount to show impairment.

138

The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 40,7% (34.3% in 2017) to 2.7% (3.8% in 2017), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.

139

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The difference between "amortisation and depreciation" that appears on the income statement and on the statement of cash flows, and the sum of the provisions reflected in the tables of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property is due to the hyperinflation adjustment made to all the profit and loss items of the Argentine entity and that, in the case of the provision for amortisation, amount to 13 thousand euros.

Investments
Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the year amounted to 143,897 thousand euros. These include 87,851 thousand euros invested by the Spanish Group company Acerinox Europa mainly in a new cold-rolling mill and a fifth annealing and pickling line. Equipment that has the most advanced technological systems and a level of competitiveness that will generate new quality standards, while reducing costs and environmental impact. With this new line, Acerinox Europe offers thinner thicknesses (with a width of 1,500 mm) to its end customers, thus expanding its product range. Although during the year the lines were launched and production has begun, they have not yet been transferred to fixed assets nor have they begun to be amortised, since the appropriate production levels and the optimum quality of the products have not yet been reached. Therefore, the lines do not yet fulfil the necessary conditions to be considered as operating in the manner envisaged by management. The Group expects to reach optimal production levels in the first quarter of 2019. The impact on the income statement of the amortisation of the lines will be 680 thousand euros/month.

On the other hand, the Group company North American Stainless made investments in the year amounting to 32,771 thousand euros.

In 2017 the investments made amounted to 173,332 thousand euros, of which 111,109 thousand euros were made by the Spanish company of the Acerinox Europe Group and related mainly to the investment in a new rolling mill and a fifth annealing and pickling line and 44,297 euros by the North American Stainless Company. The work on the new rolling mill and the bright annealing (BA) line of the North American Stainless Company was completed in 2017 and started up at the end of this year.

In 2017, on completion of the start-up period, investments made by the company North American Stainless, were reclassified from work in progress to finished goods. The amount reclassified in this company totalled 131 million euros. The amortisation of the new lines amounts to approximately 6 million euros per year.

Changes in accounting estimates
As explained in note 3, the Group periodically reviews estimated useful lives based on the valuations made by experts. As a result of these analyses carried out over the past two years, the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty), Ltd. has changed the useful lives of some of its assets. The technological improvements and maintenance plans implemented by the company have led us to forecast a lengthening of useful lives of between 5 and 10 years. The Group has accounted for the change in accounting estimates prospectively as stipulated in IAS 8. The impact of the change in accounting estimates on profit and loss at 31 December 2018 and 2017 was 659 and 2,265 thousand euros respectively, due to the reduction in provisions for this year.

Guarantees At 31 December 2017 and 2018 none of the Group's assets has been pledged to secure loans and borrowings.
Commitments At 31 December 2018 the Group had signed contracts to purchase new equipment and facilities amounting to 64,346 thousand euros, of which 40,615 thousand euros was for new investments made by Acerinox Europa for the completion of its investments in the new cold-rolling mill and the fifth annealing and pickling line. At 31 December 2017 the Group had signed contracts to purchase new equipment and facilities amounting to Euro 68,933 thousand, of which Euro 56,054 thousand was for new investments made by Acerinox Europa to complete its investments in the new rolling mill and the fifth annealing and pickling line.
Capitalised borrowing costs Borrowing costs of only 48 thousand euros have been capitalised in 2017 for the company Columbus Stainless (2,317 thousand euros in 2016, mostly corresponding to the company Columbus Stainless). The capitalisation rate in 2018 was 8.57% (9.5% in 2017).
Disposals of fixed assets The loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment or the removal of assets from service totals 2,250 thousand euros and is recognised under other operating expenses in the 2018 income statement (1.917 thousand euros in 2017). This balance primarily reflects the disposals of obsolete spare parts that were in the Group's warehouses.
The gain on the sale or withdrawal of property, plant and equipment recognised in the consolidated income statement in 2018 under "Other Operating Income" amounted to 560 thousand euros, relating mainly to the sale of two industrial plants in Spain classified as investment property (2,218 thousand euros in 2017 relating to the sale of a Group plot of land and warehouse in Malaysia and an industrial plant in Spain, also classified as investment property).
As a result of the disposal of fixed assets, there are also registered items of fixed assets with a carrying amount of 2,221 (5,660 thousand euros in 2017) that have been used for maintenance work.
Environment Property, plant and equipment held to minimise the environmental impact of the Group's activities and to protect and improve the environment at 31 December 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

In 2018, the Group received an environmental grant of 2,552 thousand euros to offset the costs of indirect greenhouse gas emissions. 186 thousand euros were received in 2017 to offset the costs of indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Both grants have been recognized as income in the year under "other operating income".

In 2018 the Group incurred environment-related ordinary expenses of 98,241 thousand euros (113,442 thousand euros in 2017).

At 31 December 2017, Columbus Group company Stainless (Pty) Ltd recognised a provision relating to environmental activities for an amount of 45 thousand euros for the rehabilitation of land owned by it. The land is an area which is currently not used for the Group's production activities.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Property, plant and equipment not used in ordinary activities Group property, plant and equipment not used in ordinary activities include several industrial bays, which are classified as investment property. Details and the valuation of this property are provided in note 9.
Other information At 31 December 2018 and 2017 there are no litigation cases, seizures or similar measures that may affect items of property, plant or equipment.
The Group's companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their property, plant and equipment. The coverage of these policies is considered sufficient.

8.1 Impairment of assets
As established in IAS 36, and as mentioned in the accounting policies (Note 2.11), at the end of each fiscal year the Group assesses whether there are any indications of impairment of assets. The value of an asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To assess indications of impairment, the Group considers both external sources of information (technological changes, significant fluctuations in market interest rates, market value of the assets) and internal sources of information (evidence of obsolescence, continued losses in the entity, substantial deviation from estimations, etc.).
The property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of the Group represent 44% of the total assets of the Group. A breakdown by company shows that 94% of the Group's property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are located in factories, with the remaining 6% held by its 33 other subsidiaries.

The majority of assets do not generate cash inflows independently, as the whole production process needs to be completed. Impairment has therefore not been estimated on an individual basis, but by allocating the assets to cash-generating units. In the case of factories, the smallest cash-generating units that can be considered encompass each factory as a whole.
During this fiscal year there have been indications of impairment in the company's Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. and S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. Both companies are on the Asian content, in Malaysia.
The indications of impairment are based on the continued losses recorded (in the case of SC Malaysia, 2017 obtained income, mainly due to the extraordinary positive result from the sale of a property) and on the substantial deviation with respect to the estimates made, especially in the case of Bahru Stainless.
Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd.
It is the most recently created factory of the Acerinox Group, located in Johor, Malaysia. It operates mainly in markets of the ASEAN area, where there is a significant price gap compared to other international markets largely due to the over-capacity in the Chinese market and the resulting pressure on international markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the different ASEAN countries and, generally, in Asia, reacted to Chinese over-capacity by instituting anti-dumping or protectionist measures in their local markets
The progress of the Asian market has been characterised by excess supply in the region and a strong increase in Indonesian production. These two circumstances kept the prices in Asia far below the rest of the markets throughout the year.
Even so, from the demand point of view, the Asian markets in general had good behaviour, particularly in China, where the apparent consumption continued growing above production, at 7% and 3% respectively, reducing the surpluses of the Asian giant, as can be seen from the available statistics on exports decreasing for the first time in many years. However, one must consider the strong increase in exports from the Chinese productor Tsingshan from its new plant in Indonesia.
In the ASEAN area, Acerinox sales rose again thanks to the Bahru Stainless factory and backed by healthy demand. Even so, in this region the pressure on prices was noted by the sharp expansion of the Chinese manufacturer Tsingshan in Indonesia.

142

The increase in production continued throughout the year, so much so that Bahru Stainless had set a new production record by year end, and it is expected to reach maximum production capacity in cold rolling production by 2020. This production increase, in addition to improvements in product quality, has resulted and will result in larger penetration rates in the ASEAN market.
The situation described above had an impact on the income of Bahru Stainless, mainly in the second half of the fiscal year, recording income before taxes far below those budgeted for 2018.
The recoverable amount of the items has been determined based on their value in use.
Value in use of the assets was determined based on the estimated future cash flows the entity expects to obtain from the asset and the discount rate, understood to be the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
To determine this discount rate, the structure of financing or leverage has been considered based on assumptions of market participants, the reference of the interest rates of Malaysian sovereign debt (10-year bond) and a capital structure, market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
The calculated discount rate is therefore 8.5% (8.66% in 2017).
Future cash flows were estimated considering:
a) R easonable assumptions and management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset, based on the information available on the analysis date.
b) Ten-year projections that reflect the financial and macroeconomic circumstances and the circumstances of the stainless steel market itself, adapted to the operating environment of each CGU analysed. The different parameters used (expected growth, use of installed production capacity, prices, working capital items, etc.) are therefore projected considering historical figures, particularly the last fiscal year closed, as well as targets set by management. Other relevant assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values at the time of the study.
c) Estimated projections for years beyond the period covered were calculated by extrapolating the previous projections using a perpetual growth rate of 2.5%, the same as in 2017. This rate has been estimated for the country and industry in which each CGU is present, in addition to the markets to which most of their output is exported.
No impairment has been recognised on property, plant and equipment during the year, as the recoverable value of the businesses, calculated by applying the discounted free cash flow method, exceeds the carrying amount of the operating assets.
KPMG ASESORES, S.L. has been hired to review the Bahru Stainless impairment test results as an independent expert, which, after analysing the information provided by the Company, has validated the conducted analysis.
The essential aspects of the impairment test conducted are detailed below:
1. Budgets
An explicit ten year period is budgeted. The budget attempts to reflect the fluctuations of the stainless steel market, replicating the upward and downward cycles based on observation of past price fluctuations (source CRU INTERNACIONAL, see comment below), removing the effect of volatility of prices of raw materials (these are assumed to be constant and no assumptions of variation are made due to their high volatility) and considering all the central premises and their likelihood of happening. To do so, two cycles are proposed; the first one, reflects substantial improvements compared with the present fiscal year, and in the second cycle, the increases in prices and the achieved margins are reversed, emulating a downward market cycle.
The commercial sales plan for the first five years is compared with two external, independent and expert sources:
1) SMR GROUP, STEEL & METALS MARKET INTELLIGENCE. This company has 25 years of proven experience in analysis and understanding of the stainless steel market. The Company sent the Bahru Stainless commercial sales plan for 2019 to 2023 to SMR Group for them to give their opinion. The following are their main conclusions:
- "Raw materials: The assumptions made by Bahru about the future costs of raw materials are basically realistic".
- " Sales prices of cold rolled products: SMR considers that the sales prices of Bahru's cold rolled stainless steel are realistic until 2023. We found that the planned prices for 2022 and 2023 are even conservative".
- "Volume of sales: Bahru's planned sales volumes are realistic and are in line with SMR's expected performance in international markets. The large increase in 2020 in the domestic market is ambitious but achievable. Despite a possible temporary market weakness in 2019-20, the international sales are in line with market shares that are achievable for Bahru Stainless. Sales in some regions could even be higher than planned".
143

Consolidated Annual Accounts
"The development of sales by grades and thicknesses is considered realistic".
"Production at levels of capacity is achievable (sales of 400,000 t of flat, cold rolled and hot rolled combined stainless steel products include 100,000 t of hot rolled stainless steel coils)".
2) CRU INTERNATIONAL. This company has 50 years of experience and is a leading provider of analysis, prices and consulting in the mining, metal and fertiliser markets. CRU supplies its subscribers with an estimation of prices in different stainless steel markets that the Company has used to compare the idea that the estimations of future prices are in line with or even below CRU's assumptions, based on the geographical areas where Bahru Stainless operates.
The budget for 2019, the basis for understanding performance in coming years, is substantiated by returning to the income and margins reached up until May of 2018, based on the measures that the Group is adopting, focused on improving margins: redistribution of sales to markets with better margins, stabilisation of the prices of raw materials and the average value of inventory, and the recovery of the market, given the extremely low prices reached at the end of 2018.
From 2020 on, the budget is based on: increasing the volume of sales to reach the full capacity of Bahru Stainless' production lines; improving margins by readjusting thicknesses, taking into account those that have been shown to contribute to improving margins; optimising the variety of types of steel offered; and expanding the presence of cold rolled products in Europe, among others.
In the period between 2024 and 2028, the margin improvements achieved in the previous period decrease, following a downward market cycle.
Due to uncertainty regarding the Asian market, based on the current excessive capacity, the low prices maintained in recent years and the growing instability generated in international trade flows due to the numerous protective international measures, the Group has considered that the flows projected by Bahru are subject to high levels of uncertainty.
Therefore, as recommended in IAS 36, a probability assignment exercise was undertaken of the likelihood of attaining the budgeted margins for the projected period, as well as for the terminal value, with the aim of reflecting the aforementioned high levels of uncertainty.
2. Terminal value
The terminal year is calculated considering the flows obtained in the express ten year period, once the abovementioned attainment probabilities have been assigned to the key assumptions. As a consequence, the flow of the last year is considered to be consistent into the future, increased by the perpetual growth rate of 2.5%.
The terminal value in the calculations performed makes up 38% of the total discounted value.
3. Results of the impairment test
The impairment test conducted up to 31 December 2018 reveals an excess of recoverable value of 75.3 million euros (329.1 million euros in 2017, considering 100% of the assets, not only the part corresponding to Acerinox's stake in Bahru Stainless) over the carrying amount of 557.9 million euros (612.2 million euros in 2017). The discount rate (WACC), 8.50% (8.66% in 2017), the growth rate (g), 2.5% (2.5% in 2017), and the average budgeted EBIT margin, 3.2% (4.7% in 2017) are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
Following a sensitivity analysis entailing different scenarios, impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 12.7% (37.5% in 2017). The growth rate (g) would have to fall to 0.3% (balancing out at 0% and increasing the WACC by 17.8% in 2017) for the carrying amount to begin to show impairment.
The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 18.4% (38.8% in 2017) to 2.6% (2.9% in 2017), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.
Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. This subsidiary markets part of the production of Bahru Stainless in the Malaysian market, and it was affected by low prices in the local market, as mentioned above.
The recoverable amount of the items has been determined based on their value in use.
Value in use of the assets was determined based on the estimated future cash flows the entity expects to obtain from the asset and the discount rate, understood to be the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
To determine this discount rate, the structure of financing or leverage has been considered based on assumptions of market participants, the reference of the interest rates of Malaysian sovereign debt (10-year bond) and a capital structure, market risk premiums and coefficients of similar companies.
144

The calculated discount rate is therefore 8.96% (8.64% in 2017).
Five year budgets approved by management were used to estimate the future flows of this commercial subsidiary, considering those based on the information available on the date of carrying out the analysis to be reasonable assumptions and better estimates, versus the economic conditions that will occur throughout the remaining lifetime of the asset, as well as the objectives indicated by management.
The estimation of the projections for the fiscal years after the express five year period were extrapolated using a perpetual growth rate of 2.5%, the same as in 2017.
No impairment has been recognised on property, plant and equipment during the year, as the recoverable value of the businesses, calculated by applying the discounted free cash flow method, exceeds the carrying amount of the operating assets.
The impairment test conducted up to 31 December 2018 reveals an excess of recoverable value of 8.7 million euros (9.2 million euros in 2017) over the carrying amount of 27.8 million euros (27 million euros in 2017). The discount rate (WACC), 8.96% (8.64% in 2017), the growth rate (g), 2.5% (2.5% in 2017), and the average budgeted EBIT margin, 4.8% (3.2% in 2017) are considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
According to the sensitivity analysis performed, the discount rate (WACC) would have to increase by 3.5 times its current value (2.50 times in 2017), while simultaneously bringing the growth rate (g) down to zero, for the carrying amount to begin to see impairment.
The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to decrease by 76.1% (68.3% decrease in 2017), to 1.1% (1.0% in 2017), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.
Impairment tests performed in 2017 The companies presenting indications of impairment were the same as in the current fiscal year. The analyses performed last year determined that the recoverable value of their assets was higher than the carrying amount. Likewise, the sensitivity analyses performed also led us to conclude that a significant change to all assumptions would be necessary for impairment to occur.

NOTE 9 INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Investment property includes Group-owned buildings not occupied by the Group which are held to earn a return, either through rentals or through capital appreciation and subsequent disposal of the buildings.

The Group has several industrial bays in Spain and other countries classified in this category, and as investment property in different subsidiaries. These are industrial bays which were used to carry out commercial activity but are currently idle, and the Group thus intends to rent or sell them.

The Group has disposed of two warehouses that had been classified as investment property, the carrying amount of which was 827 thousand euros. The profit for the sale of these warehouses was 507 thousand euros.

145

Consolidated Annual Accounts

In 2017, the Group sold two of its warehouses, which had been classified as investment property, generating a gain of 145 million euros. The carrying amount of that warehouse was 50 thousand euros.
Income from the lease of industrial bays amounted to 523 thousand euros in 2018 (486 thousand euros in 2017). The associated operating expenses, including maintenance and repairs, amount to 194 thousand euros (196 thousand euros in 2017).
At 31 December 2018 investment property has a total market value of 22,849 thousand euros (22,888 thousand euros in 2017). This valuation attends to observable variables in the market such as offers and prices per square meter of premises available in the geographical area of the real estate investments of the Group. Therefore, fair value measurement is classified within the hierarchy of LEVEL 2 in accordance with the policy established in note 2.12.5

NOTE 10 INVENTORIES

2017 322,042 194,718 433,583 39,952
189 990,484

Raw materials and other suppliers include 7,951 thousand euros reflecting the valuation of the emission allowances held by the Group at the end of the year (7,911 thousand euros in 2017).
The change in finished goods and works in progress in the year, according to the balance sheet at 31 December 2018 and 2017 shown above, differs from the figure in the income statement owing to translation differences.
The cost of goods sold has been calculated in accordance with the policy defined in note 2.13 and amounts to 4,368 million euros in 2018 (4,008 million euros in 2017).
In 2018 the Group wrote inventories down to net realisable value where this was lower than cost, with a total adjustment of 21,981 thousand euros. The adjustment recognised for 2017 amounted to 2,273 thousand euros.
Commitments At 31 December 2018 the consolidated Group has commitments to purchase raw materials for 223,657 thousand euros (208,756 thousand euros in 2017). Although no firm sales commitments exist at these reporting dates, there are formal orders for which the Group does not foresee any circumstances that could prevent delivery by the agreed deadlines.
The Group does not have any inventories with a cycle exceeding one year and therefore no borrowing costs have been capitalised.
Group companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their inventories. The coverage of these policies is considered sufficient.

10.1 Emission allowances
Pursuant to the additional provision of Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December 2016, the Group classified emission allowances as inventories.
On 15 November 2013 the Spanish Cabinet approved Acerinox Europa, S.A.U.'s definitive allocation of free-of-charge greenhouse gas emission allowances for the 2013-2020 period, 1,867,754 allowances in total. The yearly distribution of the allowances is detailed below:

2013 248,936

2014 244,613

2015 240,239

2016 235,818

2017 231,350

The following allowances were allocated to the Group company Roldan, S.A.:

2013 26,857

2014 26,391

2015 25,919

2016 25,442

Movement in emission allowances in 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Balance at 31/12/2016 Allocation for the year Disposals Balance at 31/12/2017 Allocation for the year Disposals Balance at 31/12/2018

Value (in thousands of Euros) 8,357 1,568 -2,014 7,911 1,946 -1,906 7,951

In 2018, CO2 emissions were made requiring 248,117 allowances, which will be surrendered in 2019 (259,918 in 2017, surrendered in 2018). The Group has not sold its surplus allowances.

The expense for the year in respect of CO2 emissions totals 1,846 thousand euros in 2018 (1,926 thousand euros in 2017) and is included under "other operating expenses". This is the value of the allowances surrendered in the year, equivalent to the market value of these allowances when allocated.

Disposals for the year are allowances surrendered for CO2 emissions in the prior year. This information has been audited and approved by an independent expert.

Present conditions pose no significant risk of a shortfall in emission allowances for the 2018-2020 period. The Group does not hold any futures contracts for the acquisition of emission allowances.

No significant contingency exists in respect of fines over emissions.

This amount was equal to 85%-90% of the total amount of the factored invoices, depending on the conditions of the credit insurance coverage. (149,915 thousand euros in 2017). These amounts have been derecognised as they meet the conditions specified in NIIF 9 regarding the transfer of risks and rewards.

In order to diversify the sources of its financing and extend its debt maturities, in July 2014 the Group filed a base prospectus for the issuance of fixed-income securities of Acerinox S.A. for a maximum notional amount of 500 million euros at the Spanish National Securities Market Commission. Since then, Acerinox S.A. has carried out two issues through this prospectus: the first issue of 75 million euros was placed by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch in July 2014 with a term of ten years and interest of 5%, whilst the second was placed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. for a total of 50 million euros in December 2014 with a term of four years and variable interest of 3-month Euribor + 1.75%.

During this period (December 2018), the bonds issued in 2014, totalling 50 million euros and with a maturity of 4 years, matured.

Borrowings at fixed interest rates only include loans originally arranged at fixed rates (with banks and private placements), and do not include borrowings for which interest rates have been fixed by contracting derivatives.

The carrying amount of fixed rate loans and borrowings and private placements is 540,000 thousand euros, whose fair value is 580,313 thousand euros at 31 December 2018. The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2017 was 483,143 thousand euros (carrying amount of 465,000 euros).

Variable interest rates on loans are reviewed at least once a year.

The weighted average cost of financing instruments in euros at 2018 year-end was 1.40% before taking into account hedging instruments, for a total of 1,338 million euros at year-end and 3.87% for a total of 73 million USD financing. In 2017, the Group's euro-denominated borrowings, 1.141 million euros in total, bore an average cost of 1.63%, before taking into account hedging instruments, while the average cost of borrowings in US dollars, amounting to 109 million US dollars, was 3.37%.

The Group has signed interest rate swaps whereby it can exchange the variable interest rates on its borrowings for fixed interest rates, as described in note 11.2.6.

At 31 December 2018 accrued interest payable which has not been paid in respect of loans and borrowings totals 1,513 thousand euros (1,918 thousand euros in 2017). In addition, accrued interest payable not paid on bonds issued totals 1,635 thousand euros at the 2018 reporting date (1,660 thousand euros in 2017).

Total borrowing costs calculated using the effective interest rate on loans at amortised cost amount to 1,636 thousand euros (2,808 thousand euros in 2017).

150

At 31 December 2018, the Group has credit facilities with financial institutions with a maximum available limit of 1,903 million euros, of which 1,402 million euros was drawn down at 31 December 2018. At the 2017 year end, the maximum available limit from credit facilities was 1,964 million euros and the amount drawn down on that date was 1,230 million euros.
Certain Group companies have contracted reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are recognised under trade and other payables until they are settled or repaid or have expired. The Group uses confirming only as a payment instrument, but not as a financing instrument. Invoices are paid on due date without any advantage being gained from the use of confirming.
Main financing operations undertaken in the year The most significant financing transaction in 2018 was the signing with the Spanish Official Credit Institute (ICO) of an eight-year 100 million euro loan. The loan was paid out at the end of June 2018 and matures in March 2026. It comes with a two-year interest-only repayment period and will be repaid in four half-yearly instalments of 5 million euro each, starting in September 2020, and eight half-yearly instalments of 10 million euro each, the last falling on the loan maturity date. The loan was awarded to Acerinox S.A. and the Group has undertaken to maintain, over the life of the loan, an annual financial compliance ratio between its consolidated net financial debt and its equity.
Meanwhile, the loan of 70 million euros that Acerinox S.A. signed with the European Investment Bank ("EIB") in December 2017 was delivered in June.
Lastly, and taking advantage of good market conditions, Acerinox S.A. has renegotiated five existing loan contracts with Abanca, Banca March, Caixabank, Kutxabank and Banco Sabadell, for a total amount of 305 million euros, improving costs and margins and extending terms.
In the case of debt renegotiations, the Group assesses the significance of the modifications made to determine whether they are materially different, according to the criteria established in the valuation policy detailed in note 2.12.3, therefore the effects of the new agreement should be recorded as if it were a cancellation and, simultaneously, a new loan. According to the 305 million euros detailed in previous paragraph, 205 million euros correspond to new loans which belongs to the renegotiated loans with Banca March, Caixabank and Banco Sabadell. During the year, the amount of commissions recognised in profit or loss on renegotiated loans, which have been derecognised from the liability, was 447 thousand euros.
The most noteworthy financing operations during 2017 were:
· In 2017, the Borrowing Base Facility of Columbus Stainless Pty Ltd. was restructured and the contracted term extended, which amount ZAR 3,500 million. The transaction, which was originally signed in 2015, was extended for another two and a half years, including modifications in its structure to give Columbus greater flexibility, while a new financial institution was added to the group of lenders: Citibank N.A. South African Branch. The participating entities include Deutsche Bank AG, Johannesburg Branch, Bankinter S.A., Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A., FirstRand Bank Limited, Banco Santander S.A., Banco de Sabadell S.A. London Branch, Caixabank S.A., Investec Bank Limited, Nedbank Limited, HSBC Bank Plc Johannesburg Branch and Citibank N.A. South African Branch. The lead arranger of the transaction continued to be Deutsche Bank AG, Amsterdam Branch. This facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under bank borrowings of current liabilities. At 31 December 2017 no amount has been drawn down from this facility.
· In addition, in June 2017, another non-extinctive amendment was made to the syndicated factoring agreement of 370 million euros, extending the termination date of the contract to June 2019. The participants in the transaction have not changed and they include Santander Factoring y Confirming S.A. E.F.C., Banca March S.A., Caixabank S.A., Popular de Factoring S.A. E.F.C., Bankinter S.A., Banco Sabadell S.A. and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur International S.A. The lead arranger of the transaction continued to be Santander Factoring y Confirming S.A. E.F.C.
· Lastly, and taking advantage on good market conditions Acerinox S.A. signed eight new loan agreements in 2017 and an annex amending an existing loan, for an aggregate amount of 725 million euros, as follows:
- The annex to amend an existing loan was signed with Banco Santander.
- Loans signed with Banco de Sabadell, Bankia, Banco Santander, Banco Popular and Bankinter to cancel existing loans with the same entities, improving their conditions and extending their maturities.
- N ew loan agreements signed with Banco Social de Crédito Cooperativo, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Banca March and the European Investment Bank totalled 210 million euros. The loan signed with Banca March was transferred to a securitisation fund upon signing, through which an international investor took a position in the loan, with Banca March acting as the intermediary.
The Acerinox Group has satisfactorily met the repayment schedules for its financial debt.

According to 2017, out of the 725 million euros in financing referred to in the previous paragraph, 570 million euros were recognised as non-current loans and borrowings in the accounts. There are two reasons for this difference. On the one hand, the loan signed with the European Investment Bank for 70 million euros was not drawn downs this year. On the other hand, and regarding the loan of 100 million euros that have with Banco Santander, during 2017 only 35 million euros have been drawn down (of which 20 are classified as current), and the remaining 65 million euros have been drawn in 2018.

Non-current borrowings subject to covenants
a) Ratios linked to profit and loss
Currently, no loan agreement signed by Acerinox has convenants linked to ratios that take into account the Group's results.
In 2017 there was a loan agreement signed by Acerinox in 2008 with the ICO (Spanish Official Credit Institute) which expired in July 2018, with a covenant linked to ratios that take into account the Group's results. Specifically net financial debt/EBITDA, and net financial debt/equity. At year end, the outstanding amount repayable on the ICO loan was16.3 million US dollars.
b) Ratios linked to equity
At the 2018 reporting date there are three financing contracts subject to covenants, relating to the maintenance of minimum consolidated equity levels. This is the loan signed in March 2017 with Banca March for 50 million euros and transferred to a Securitisation Fund at the time of signature, the loan signed with the European Investment Bank ("EIB") in December 2017 for 70 million euros and the loan signed in March 2018 with the Spanish Official Credit Institute ("ICO") for 100 million euros. This type of ratio is standard market practice in financing at these terms, as the loan signed with Banca March has a term of 7 years, the EIB one has a term of 10 years and the ICO one has a term of 8 years.

152

Additionally, the Group company Columbus Stainless has structured financing (Borrowing Base Facility) which is also subject to a ratio relating to the maintenance of minimum equity levels in that company. This facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under bank borrowings of current liabilities. At neither 31 December 2017 nor at the close of 2018 had any amount has been drawn down from this facility.

At the year end (as in 2017) Acerinox, S.A. and Columbus Stainless Ltd comply with all ratios required under the contracts mentioned above.

11.2.4 Measurement of fair value
As established in the accounting policies, the Group measures at fair value, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and derivative financial instruments.

Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified based on valuation inputs into the following levels:

LEVEL 1: quoted prices in active markets LEVEL 2: observable market variables other than quoted prices LEVEL 3: variables not observable in the market

The Group's position at 3s1 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

No financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value have been transferred between levels.

In the case of Level 2 financial instruments, the Group uses generally accepted valuation techniques that take into account spot and future exchange rates at the valuation date, forward interest rates, interest rate spreads and credit risk of both the Group and its counterparty, i.e. the financial institutions with which it operates.

11.2.5 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

The shares that the Group does not intend to sell and that it has designated in this category at the initial moment are recognised in this section.

The value of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income total 11,514 thousand euros at year end, of which 11,227 thousand euros reflect Acerinox's investment in the Japanese Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited (Nisshin), company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange until 26 December 2018.

In March 2017, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (Nippon) acquired a significant stake in Nisshin, enabling them to improve their competitiveness. In May 2018, in order to finalise the synergies between the two Groups, the Board of Directors considered it necessary to acquire control of 100% of the shares of Nisshin in order to complete the consolidation process.

Thus, based on the agreements reached at the extraordinary General Meeting called by Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd. it was determined that effective 1 January 2019, a swap of the shares of Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd. would be carried out for shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (Nippon). As a consequence of these Acerinox agreements, Acerinox will receive 0,71 shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation for every share in Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. Nisshin's shares ceased trading on 26 December 2018.

The Group determined the fair value of the Nisshin shares at year-end to be the market value of the Nippon shares based on the number of shares that will correspond to it as from 1 January 2019. Acerinox owned 1,052,600 shares of Nisshin Steel, Co., which is equivalent, after the exchange equation, to 747,346 shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation. The market value at 31 December 2018 of these shares was 1,892.5 JPY per share. The amount of the devaluation, recognized in other comprehensive income, amounted to -3,248 thousand euros in this year.

The Group has decided to maintain the classification of this portfolio of shares into financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, since this is a strategic holding that is not held with the intention of selling it. Nisshin Steel has, in turn, a 15.49% interest in Acerinox.

153

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The market value at 31 December 2017 of Nissin was 1.852 JPY per share. Acerinox held 1,052,600 shares in this company, that represented a percentage ownership of 0.96%. The amount of the revaluation, recognised in other comprehensive income, amounted to 2,145 thousand euros in 2017.
Acerinox S.A. has not purchased or sold any shares in Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited neither in 2018 nor in 2017.
Also in 2015, the Group company Acerinox Europa acquired a non-controlling interest of 7.36% in the company Fortia Energía, S.L., whose corporate purpose is the acquisition of electricity on behalf of its shareholders, for 275 thousand euros. The Group's Spanish factories can obtain more competitive electricity prices as a result of this investment. This investment is measured at cost of acquisition, as there is insufficient data to measure it at fair value. In any event, the Group does not consider there to be indications of impairment.

11.2.6 Derivative financial instruments As detailed in note 4, in relation to market risk, the Group is essentially exposed to three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to certain risks.
The Group classifies derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Those that qualify as hedging instruments are classified as hedging derivatives and are recognised by applying the measurement criteria defined in note 2.12.4.
Derivative financial instruments classified by category are as follows:

As explained in note 4.1.2, this year the Group arranged interest rate derivatives amounting to 250 million, equivalent to the amount of the new loans arranged with Banca March, Caixabank, ICO and BEI.
Following the repayment this year of the loan granted by the ICO in USD, the cross currency swap derivative financial instrument has also been cancelled.

Currency risk
The Group operates in a large number of countries and bills customers in different currencies, depending on the country where it is billing. Therefore it uses certain financial instruments to hedge cash flow risks arising from the settlement of balances in foreign currencies. The contracted operations mainly comprise forward sales and purchases in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges with derivative financial instruments a majority of the commercial and financial transactions carried out in a currency other than the functional currency of a country.
In accordance with the Group's hedging strategy, none of the derivatives arranged at 31 December 2018 were considered hedge accounting, since they are all used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in profit or loss. Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates that could affect assets or

154

liabilities denominated in foreign currency would be offset by a change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. Changes in the derivative are recorded in the same way in the income statement, offsetting any changes that occur in foreign currency monetary items.

At 31 December 2018 the effect of measuring these derivatives at market value was 12,878 thousand euros, which is recognised under remeasurement of financial instruments to fair value in the income statement (-29,836 thousand euros in 2017). The exchange gains obtained by the Group in the year amounted to 455 thousand euros (40,054 thousand euros of profits in 2017). The differences between the two amounts are mainly due to the interest rate differentials between the currencies involved in the exchange risk insurance contracted.

At 31 December 2018 all exchange rate insurance policies basically cover both receivables (assets) and payables (liabilities) and include both commercial and financing transactions between Group companies. At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the Group's exchange risk insurance totalled 998 thousand euros (-11,059 thousand euros in 2017), of which 2,564 thousand euros is recognised under assets and 1,566 thousand euros under liabilities. Of these, there is no forward exchange rate derivatives at year-end that has been recorded in accordance with hedge accounting (only 18 thousand euros, recorded in accordance with hedge accounting in 2017). In this year an amount of -154 thousand euros were transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to profit and loss for the year (-147 thousand euros in 2017).

All of the Group's forward currency purchase and sale contracts have a term of less than one year.

At 31 December 2018 the Group has used contracts for foreign currency transactions amounting to 314 million euros for currency sales and 500 million euros for currency purchases. At 31 December 2017, 328 thousand euros were used for sales and 527 million euros for purchases. Details of these forward exchange contracts by currency are as follows:

At 31 December 2018 there were no loans with banks in currencies other than the functional currency and, therefore, the Group no longer has derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to both currency risk and interest rate risk. At 31 December 2017, there were contracts of this nature, as explained in the section below.

Interest rate risk
In order to hedge the interest rate risk on a portion of its current and non-current bank borrowings, the Group has entered into the following swaps as of 31 December 2018:

Notional value contracted

Outstanding amount

Maturity

Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate Variable to fixed rate

EUR 76,13 million EUR 30 million EUR 70 million EUR 50 million EUR 100 million

EUR 13,43 million EUR 30 million EUR 70 million EUR 50 million 100 million euros

2020 2023 2028 2022 2026

The average interest rate of euro-denominated financing hedged by a derivative financial instrument at year-end totals 263.4 million euros, is 1.97% (4% in 2017). The credit spread has been included in both cases.

At the end of 2018 there was no USD interest rate derivatives to hedge USD loans, while in 2017 the average rate for USD loans hedged by USD interest rates derivatives was 3.65%.

Details at 31 December 2017 were as follows:

Notional value contracted

Outstanding amount

USD variable to EUR fixed rate Variable to fixed rate

USD 160 million EUR 76,13 million

USD 16,33 million EUR 22,39 million

2018 2020

The fair value of fixed interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is based on the market value of equivalent derivative financial instruments at the reporting date and amounts to -5,484 thousand euros (154 thousand euros at 31 December 2017), which included, in addition to the valuation of interest rate swaps, the valuation of a cross currency swap). These amounts are recognised in the Group's consolidated balance sheet under the following headings:

At 31 December 2018 and 2017 the derivatives contracted qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and therefore the unrealised loss of -6,243 thousand euros on their measurement at fair value has been recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss of 4,528 thousand euros in 2017).
In 2018, an amount of 2,072 thousand euros was transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to profit and loss for the year (6,138 thousand euros in 2017). Combined with the -154 thousand euros derived from the currency hedges referred to in the previous section, these totalled 1919 thousand euros, which appear in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (-147 in 2017 and a total of 5,991 thousand euros).
The Group has documented the effectiveness of the derivatives contracted to be recognised as hedging instruments, as detailed in note 2.12.4. Hedging transactions have been contracted for periods and amounts equivalent to the cash flows derived from the loans associated with each instrument. The financial instruments that are considered hedge accounting were not ineffective at any point in 2017 or 2018.

a) Share capital
The Parent Company's share capital solely comprises ordinary shares. All these shares have the same rights and there are no statutory restrictions on their transferability.

At 31 December 2018 and 2017, share capital is represented by 276,067,543 ordinary shares, with a par value of 0.25 euros each, subscribed and fully paid.

All the shares are listed on the Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges.

At 31 December 2018, the only holders of 10% or more of the share capital of Acerinox, S.A. are Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., with 18.96%, in both 2018 and 2017, and Nisshin Steel Holding, Co. Ltd. with 15.49% in 2018 (15.49% in 2017).

In this year, as well as in 2017, there were no changes in share capital.

b) Share premium There has been no distribution of the share premium in 2018 or 2017.

The share premium is subject to the same restrictions and may be used for the same purpose as the voluntary reserves of the Parent Company, including conversion into share capital.

c) Treasury shares
In order to improve earnings per share by reducing the number of shares issued in the four years (2013-2016) for which the dividend was paid by means of a flexible dividend or scrip dividend, the Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. intends to approve successive share repurchase programmes.

The Board of Directors of Acerinox held on 19 December 2018, making use of the authorisation granted for a period of five years by the General Meeting of the Company held in June 2014, and pursuant to the provisions of article 17 of Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 on Market Abuse, has approved a First Share Repurchase Programme with the aim of reducing the share capital of Acerinox, S.A. through the redemption of its own shares, if the General Meeting so approves, in order to improve earnings per share.

The maximum investment will be 66 million euros and the maximum number of shares to be acquired may not exceed 5,521,350, representing 2% of the Company's capital.

The shares must be purchased at market price and under the price and volume conditions set out in Article 3 of the Commission's Delegated Regulation EU 2016/1052 of 8 March 2016. The Company may not acquire shares at a price higher than the highest of the price of the last independent transaction or the highest independent bid at that time at the trading venue where the purchase is made.
The Company shall not buy on any trading day more than 25% of the average daily volume of the shares at the trading venue where the purchase is made. The average daily volume of the Company's shares for the purposes of the foregoing calculation shall be based on the average daily volume traded in the twenty business days prior to the date of each purchase. This limit shall apply for the entire duration of the programme.

157

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The maximum term of the approved plan is from 21 December 2018 to 20 March 2019, both included.
Acerinox, S.A. reserves the right to terminate the Programme if, prior to its term limit, shares had been acquired for an acquisition price that reached the maximum investment price or the maximum number of shares covered by the Programme. It may also be terminated early in the event of any other circumstance that makes it advisable.
The Board of Directors of the Company will propose to the next Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of the Company a reduction in the share capital sufficient to redeem the shares acquired as a result of this Programme.
As of 31 December 2018, 368,320 shares had been acquired. The value of the shares in portfolio at year-end was 3,417 thousand euros.
In 2017 there were no movements regarding own shares.
13.2 Distribution of dividends
The Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. has decided to propose to the next Ordinary General Meeting of the Company an 11% increase in shareholder remuneration by increasing the dividend per share from 0.45 to 0.50 euros.
On 10 May 2018, at their General Meeting the shareholders approved the distribution of a cash dividend of 0.45 gross euros per share, charged to unrestricted reserves. The dividend was paid on 5 July 2018 and totalled 124,230 thousand euros.
13.3 Reserves
a) Retained earnings Retained earnings include consolidated profit or loss for the year and reserves in fully consolidated companies, as well as Parent Company reserves other than those mentioned below.
Details of reserves by company are included in note 13.5.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of funds by any Group company in the form of dividends, except for the non-distributable reserves required by applicable legislation. At 31 December 2018, 35,352 thousand euros of the Group's reserves and retained earnings are subject to restrictions (27,037 thousand euros at 31 December 2017).
The Parent Company's legal reserve, which is included under retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity, has been appropriated in compliance with article 274 of the Spanish Companies Act, which requires companies to transfer 10% of profits for the year to a legal reserve until this reserve reaches an amount equal to 20% of share capital. At 31 December 2018, the Company has appropriated an amount equivalent to 19.41% of its share capital to this reserve (18.25% in 2017), totalling 13,399 thousand euros in 2018 (12,599 in 2017).
The legal reserve is not distributable to shareholders and if it is used to offset losses, if no other reserves are available, the reserve must be replenished with future profits.
b) Property, plant and equipment revaluation reserve As permitted by Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of 7 June 1996, containing urgent tax measures and initiatives aimed at boosting and deregulating the economy, the Parent Company revalued its property, plant and equipment. The amount of the reserve reflects the revaluation gains, net of tax at 3%.
The deadline for tax inspection was three years from 31 December 1996. Consequently, as no inspection took place, this balance can be used to offset losses or increase the Company's share capital.
The balance of this account will only be distributable, either directly or indirectly, to the extent that gains have been realised.
c) Hedging reserve The hedging reserve includes cumulative net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments associated with highly probable future transactions that are yet to occur.
d) Fair value adjustment of financial assets The Company has classified certain financial instruments as at fair value in comprehensive income. In accordance with the valuation standard, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. There is a detailed description of instruments classified as available for sale and their measurement in note 11.2.5. e) Actuarial valuation reserve This reserve includes the changes in the actuarial value of defined benefit plan obligations.

EThe increase in equities, as a consequence of translation differences, is primarily due to the 5% appreciation of the USD this year. (2017 depreciation of 13.3%). The EUR/USD exchange rate at the end of 2018 is 1.145, compared to 1.1993 at the end of 2017. The impact of the Rand, however, was negative due to depreciation. The South African Rand also fell by 11.2% this year, with the 2018 year-end exchange rate of 16.4594 while at the end of 2017 it was 14.8054.

13.6 Adjustment for hyperinflation
Since 1 July 2018, Argentina has been declared a hyperinflationary economy by meeting the qualification requirements set out in NIC 29. The Acerinox Group has an entity in Argentina, which is dedicated solely to the commercialization of stainless steel in this country, so the amount of its assets, liabilities and its contribution to the Group's results are not significant. The Group has not re-expressed the comparative figures for the previous period since the impacts are not significant for the Group.
In any case, the financial statements of Acerinox Argentina related to 2018 have been expressed in terms of the current unit of measure at the closing date of the reporting period. The cost re-expressed of each non-monetary party of the financial statements, has been determined by applying the historical cost of such items and the accumulated depreciation, the variation of a general price index from the date of acquisition until the end of the period on which advises. The revaluation of non-monetary assets has amounted to 248 thousand euros.
In this year, which is the first period of application of this standard, the components of the owners ` patrimony, except the accumulated earnings and surplus of asset revaluation, have been re-expressed by applying a general price index to the different items, from the dates in which they were contributed, or from the moment they arose by any other route. Accumulated earnings re-expressed they are the result of the application of these indexes to the rest of the financial status amounts. The impact on reserves has reached 351 thousand euros, as reflected in the state of changes in equity.
All items in the global outcome state have also been expressed in the current currency unit at the end of the reporting period. All amounts have been re-expressed by applying a calculated index based on the variation experienced by the general price index, from the date when the expenses and income were collected in the financial statements. The amount recognised in the income statement for this concept amounts to 199 thousand euros.

13.7 Non-controlling interests
At the end of this year, two companies with non-controlling interests are Columbus Stainless, Ltd. (Columbus) 24% of which is held by the South African group IDC (Industrial Development Corporation) and Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. (Bahru) whose minority interests have been reduced to 3% owned by Hanwa, Co. Ltd.
As explained in note 5.2, at the close of this financial year, Acerinox, S.A. acquired from Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. its 30% stake in Bahru Stainless Sdn, Bhd. Since the purchase was made at year-end, the Group recognised the results corresponding to the 30% ownership interest up to the acquisition date as results attributed to non-controlling interests.
There are no rights to protect non-controlling interests that may restrict the entity's ability to access or use assets and to settle the entity's liabilities.
Neither of these companies distributed dividends in 2018 or 2017.
The detail of the main items in the financial statements of Columbus, which is the only Group company with significant non-controlling interests at year-end, is as follows:

When Columbus Stainless was founded, Acerinox signed in December 2001 a Shareholder´s Agreement, with the three South African partners, Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Ltd., Samancor Ltd. and IDC , which had a stake in it.

Clause 9 of the contract stipulated that, in the event of a change of control in Acerinox S.A., the contract would be terminated , by virtue of which a shareholder acquired shares of Acerinox S.A. that granted it a majority of votes in the Meeting or in the Board, the partners could exercise an option to sell their shareholding to Acerinox.

161

Consolidated Annual Accounts

In the 17 years that have passed, two of the three partners who signed the agreement, Highveld and Samancor, have renounced the shareholding, and the third, IDC , a state entity to support industrial development in South Africa, has increased its participation from 12% to 24%, given its interest in supporting the creation of wealth, the maintenance of employment, and the consideration of Stainless Steel as a strategic sector for the country. It has recently declared itself to be its strategic, and long-term involvement.
It is for this reason that the exercise of this option, in the assumption of the mentioned hypothesis, is highly unlikely for the only minority shareholder of Columbus Stainless, since its permanence is not determined, as it was in the other shareholders, by the presence of Acerinox, but by the support to the national industry.
Bahru
The total assets of Bahru Stainless, Sdn. Bhd., its total assets at the end of 2017 amounted to 861 million euros, of which 617 million were noncurrent.

13.8 Distribution of profits
The distribution of earnings of the Parent Company, Acerinox, S.A. for 2018, as proposed by the Board of Directors, to be submitted to the shareholders for approval at their Annual General Meeting is as follows:

Basis of allocation: Profit for the year
Application: Prior years' losses

2018 -125,599,654 -125,599,654

At their General Meeting held on 10 May 2018, the shareholders agreed that the Parent Company's profit for 2017 should be distributed as follows:

Basis of allocation: Profit for the year

2017 7,998,570

Application: Legal reserves Prior years' losses

799,857 7,198,713

13.9 Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

(Figures in thousands of euros) Profit attributable to the Group Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding Earnings per share (in Euros)

0,86

2017 234,144 276,067,543
0,85

The Group has not issued any financial instruments that give access to capital or convertible debt and therefore diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share.

NOTE 14 DEFERRED INCOME

An expense of 8,099 thousand euros has been recognised for the year under "personnel expenses" in the consolidated income statement in respect of such plans (7,545 thousand euros in 2017).

Consolidated Annual Accounts

In relation to the amount recorded in 2017 under pension plans comprises the contributions made by North American Stainless to pension plans for certain employees. These liabilities have been duly externalised and the Company has no additional obligations. The company had thus recorded an asset for the same amount. In this year, the Group netted the liability with the amount of the assets at fair value assigned to the plan,
in the same way as for the other benefits, and as indicated in the accounting policies (note 2.16)

In addition, there are obligations under from certain retirement contractual covenants agreed with senior management in the amount of 11.5 million euros (9.9 million euros in 2017). These obligations were properly insured in both 2018 and 2017, and their estimated amount covered by cash flows arising from the insurance policies contracted. As a result, no liability in this connection is recognised.

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value are detailed below:

Mortality table CPI Wage growth Social Security growth Retirement years Accrual accounting method

PERM / F2000 P 1.50% 1.50% 1.50% 65 years
Projected Unit Credit

ost-employment obligations reflect post-retirement medical care plans provided by Columbus Stainless to specified plan members. No new members have joined the plan. The Company performs actuarial valuations of the obligations every two years. The most recent valuation was performed in 2017. The assumptions used were: discount rate of 9,5% (9% according to the previous valuation performed in 2015) and 6,75% inflation of medical services (7% in the prior valuation). The opening balance for the period reconciles with the closing balance as follows:

(Figures in thousands of euros)
Balance at 1 January Contributions paid Service cost recognised in the income statement Interest cost Actuarial loss recognised in comprehensive income Translation differences Balance at 31 December

2018 8,491 -287
174 712
-854 8,236

2017 8,896 -311
212 768 -865 -209 8,491

The discount rates applied are based on expected growth rates of health insurance. Any change in such fees may have an impact in the recognised obligations or in comprehensive income. An increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would increase the obligation by 1.6 million euros (1.2 in 2017). In contrast, a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate would reduce the obligation by 1.1 million euros in both 2018 and 2017.

15.1.3 Share-based payment transactions
The Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. held on 22 March 2018 approved a multi-year remuneration plan, or long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which will allow the executive board member and senior managers of the Acerinox Group to receive part of their variable remuneration in shares in Acerinox, S.A. The target amount is 30-50% of their base salary, subject to a personal limit of 200% of the respective target. This plan was subsequently submitted to the Acerinox Shareholders' Meeting held on 10 May 2018, which approved the First Cycle of said Plan.
The now approved LTIP features three three-year cycles. The first cycle of the plan runs from 1 January 2018 through to 31 December 2020, the second from 1 January 2019 through to 31 December 2021 and the third from 1 January 2020 through to 31 December 2022.
Under the remuneration plan, employees receive shares o the parent company at the end of each cycle ("Performance Shares"). Delivery of the shares and the number to be delivered are conditional on certain vesting requirements, relating to the employee remaining in service and attaining certain individual corporate objectives. The Group presumes that the services are to be provided over the irrevocability or vesting period as consideration for the future delivery of the shares. Accordingly, the services rendered are reported on a straight line basis over the period in which the rights to receive those shares become irrevocable.
The Group measures the assets or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at fair value, on the date of the concession agreement for the equity instruments to be awarded. The Group uses the evaluation of an independent expert to do this, who uses an evaluation method accepted by standard market techniques
The associated expense accrued in this year was 613 thousand euros, with a balancing entry under Other equity instruments.
When calculating this theoretical number of shares, the shares of Acerinox, S.A. will be measured at their quoted price 30 trading days prior to the start of the plan. The resulting number of Performance Shares will be used as the basis for determining the effective number of shares in Acerinox,

164

S.A. to be delivered (if any) on reaching the end of each cycle, depending on attainment with objectives and subject also to compliance with the requirements set out in the regulations governing each plan.
The number of shares to be delivered will be calculated by reference to the value of the Acerinox share at the start of the plan in question. Any subsequent increase or decrease in the value of those shares will be assumed by the employee.
A maximum of 185,303 shares will be delivered under the first cycle of the plan, representing 0.07% of the share capital of Acerinox, S.A. This number of shares is based on the initial value of the shares calculated in accordance with the regulations governing the LTIP and the maximum theoretical remuneration under the plan, as well as the number of beneficiaries at 1 January 2018 and the fact that the number of beneficiaries may increase in future if the Board of Directors increases the size of the senior management team.

CO2
These are provisions for CO2 emissions during the year for which the emission allowances have not yet been surrendered at the year-end (see note 10.1).
Applications for the year are mainly due to the derecognition of emission allowances for 2018, totalling 1,906 thousand euros (2,014 thousand euros in 2017) (see note 10.1).
Litigation
With regard to the tax-related lawsuits that have been ongoing between the Group and the tax authorities in Germany and Italy since 2011, due to transfer pricing adjustments imposed in both countries, which are explained in detail in note 18.5, the Group decided for 2017 to make a provision of 6,092 thousand euros for any amounts payable arising from the inspection in Germany and 7,195 thousand euros for adjustments arising from the inspection in Italy. In November 2017, the Group received notification from the Spanish and German authorities of the resolution through the mutual agreement procedure. After the agreement reached between the two countries, the transfer pricing adjustments initially imposed on the Group were reduced by 40%. However, the agreement only covered transactions between Spain and Germany and, therefore, in view of the uncertainty regarding the treatment that the German inspection would give to the adjustments derived from third countries for stainless steel purchases made by Acerinox Deutschland, GmbH, the Group decided to provide for the possible risk arising from these adjustments, as well as the tax rate differential between Spain and Germany due to the agreements finally reached by the Authorities of both countries. During the year, following the resolution of the mutual agreements and the agreements reached between Acerinox Deutschland Gmbh, the Group recognised all the impacts arising from the completion of the inspection and therefore reversed the provision. Note 18.5 details all the impacts recognised by the Group.
With respect to Italy, although negotiations between both countries (Spain and Italy) are yet to begin, the Group decided to treat this in the same way as Germany. Therefore, it made a provision for the maximum amounts that it could have to pay for adjustments originating from third countries (non-members of the European Union), and the difference in tax rates between both countries. This year, the Group re-evaluated this provision and decided to increase it by 620 thousand euros as a result of new assessments received corresponding to 2013, which are also explained in note 18.5.
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly reflect Inoxcenter, S.L.U.'s estimate of the probable obligations totalling 386 thousand euros arising from the workforce restructuring plan implemented in 2013 pursuant to Royal Decree-Law 5/2013.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

15.3 Guarantees provided
At 31 December 2018 the Group has provided guarantees to third parties, mainly government bodies, totalling 23 million euros (20 million euros in 2017). This amount includes the guarantee provided to the Italian taxation authorities as a result of the assessments arising from the inspection for an amount of 1.8 million euros as explained in note 18.5. Group management does not expect any significant liabilities to arise from these guarantees.

15.4 Contingencies
In addition to the tax contingencies discussed in note 18.5, in 2016 Gas Natural Comercializadora, S.A requested that declaratory proceedings be opened against the Group companies Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A. and Inoxfil, S.A. for an alleged breach of the natural gas supply contracts and requested the payment of the compensation due to unilateral termination, as agreed in these contracts, totalling 8.2 million euros. Gas Natural Comercializadora S.A. submitted a bid in the supply service tender held by Acerinox during 2016 and 2017, but a different company was selected. The Group considers that it is unlikely that any amount payable will arise following the related legal proceedings that are underway. The judicial proceeding is continuing, and the trial is expected for the first quarter of 2019.

Interest income includes mainly those arising from the Group's forward cash placements (note 12), as well as 2.205 thousand euros derived from tax refunds obtained in both Spain and Germany as a result of the mutual agreements reached between the two countries, which are explained below in note 18.5.

Finance costs mainly reflect interest accrued on loans and borrowings and bonds issued, which are explained in note 11.2.3.

Lastly, income from translation differences arise in the Group's trade, financial operations and investments. The Group hedges with derivative financial instruments a majority of the transactions carried out in a currency other than the functional currency of a country. Using these instruments ensures that any fluctuation in exchange rates would be offset by a contrary change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. The differences between the two amounts are mainly due to the interest rate differentials between the currencies involved in the exchange risk insurance contracted.

NOTE 18 TAXATION
18.1 Legislative amendments
Tax reform in the United States
On 22 December 2017, the biggest tax reform in the United States in the last 30 years was approved, and it applies to tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The main measure is the reduction of the federal tax rate from the 35% that has been applicable to date, to 21%. This tax reduction is very positive for the Group, not just for the future because of the reduced tax burden on revenue generated by the Group subsidiary North American Stainless, but also because of the impact that this tax cut has on the deferred tax liabilities recognised by the Company at the close of the 2017 accounts and had to be reduced in accordance with the new applicable tax rates.
The impact in 2018 of the reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% applicable until 2017 to the current 21% was 23,241 thousand euros (27,425 thousand USD).

168

The impact of this reduction in the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities was recognised in 2017 as detailed in last year's annual accounts and is set out in the following table:

Total impact on income in USD

74,294

Total impact on income in Euros

65,741

The positive impact of the tax reform amounted to 65,741 thousand euros (74,294 thousand USD), and it is broken down as follows:

· 69,107 thousand euros (78,098 USD) corresponded to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities arising mainly from the different tax and accounting treatment of amortisation and depreciation of assets.

· A negative amount of 1,671 thousand euros (-1,888 USD) corresponded to the reduction in deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences for provisions that are not tax-deductible. The company also made a provision of 1,695 thousand euros (-1,916 thousand USD) for the tax on undistributed accumulated income of investees.

At the same time, the reform includes a number of other measures. The impact on the Group, after calculating its effects on income tax in 2018, is as follows:

· "Bonus depreciation": allows a tax deduction of 100% of the value of qualifying assets, put into operation between 27 September 2017 and 1 January 2023, whose useful life is equal to or less than 20 years. NAS has applied reduction of 25 million USD (equivalent to 21,834 thousand euros) has been applied to the tax base, resulting in a tax reduction of 5.25 million USD (4,585 thousand euros). This deduction leads to a temporary difference liability and reduces the tax payable in the United States, but does not affect the Group's earnings.

· "Global intangible low-taxed income" (GILTI): This is an expansion of the international tax transparency regime in the United States of a percentage of the income obtained from the exploitation of intangible assets through subsidiary companies located in third countries. The impact on the Group of this measure has not been significant (38 thousand USD, equivalent to 32 thousand euros).

· "Foreign derived intangible income" (FDII): this introduces a new preferential regime (foreign-derived intangible income) on earnings from the exploitation of American intangible assets abroad. This preferential arrangement consists of a 37.5% reduction in export earnings. Carried out by North American Stainless Financial Investments Ltd. The deduction applied in 2018 by North American Stainless was 8.6 million USD (7,288 thousand euros), which meant a reduction in tax expense of 1.8 million USD (1,525 thousand euros).

· "Deemed repatriation toll charge": 100% exemption has been introduced for the investee companies of American companies, in exchange for an additional, mandatory toll charge. This charge is calculated according to the cumulative earnings in the American company's investee companies since 1986. The tax rate applicable ranges from 8% to 15.5%, payable in 8 years. The applicable rate depends on whether or not the reserves are in the form of liquid assets. The company North American Stainless made a provision of 1,695 thousand euros for an amount payable in 8 years, for its accumulated reserves in the investee company in Canada. In exchange, this year the North American Stainless Company was able to distribute a dividend of 31 million USD from its subsidiary in Canada without having to pay tax in the United States.

· "Base erosion anti-abuse tax" (BEAT): this is a minimum tax of 5% on payments made to foreign affiliates (excluding payments for purchases), provided that they exceed 3% of total operating expenses. In the case of the Group, the payments currently being made by the American company to the rest of the Group's companies do not exceed the set limits so this measure has had no impact on the Group.

· In addition, the deduction established for American manufacturing companies ("section 199 - domestic manufacturing deduction"), which NAS has thus far been applying, has been eliminated by the tax reform. Despite the negative effect that this could have, it is clearly offset by the effect of the reduction in the tax rate.

Other measures introduced, but which have no impact on the Group are:

· Offsetting of tax loss carryforwards: it will be possible to offset these with 80% of the income generated in future years. This eliminates the time limit and the possibility of offsetting with profits from previous years. This measure has no impact on the Group as it does not have any tax loss carryforwards yet to be offset.

· Limitation of interest expense deductibility: all interest may be deducted up to a limit of 30% of EBITDA+financial income. Any interest not deducted in a year may be used in future years, without any time limit. This limit will be 30% of EBIT from 2022. This measure has no impact on the Group as the American company has no external financing.

169

Consolidated Annual Accounts

In addition, in 2018, a modification has been approved for the state tax of Kentucky, the state in which one of the Group's main subsidiaries, North American Stainless, is located. The main change is a lower tax rate of 5% (down from 6%) and the change made to the factor used to determine the tax base attributable to the State. This measure has led to an additional reduction in deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, which has led to an income of 3,769 thousand euros in this year's tax, but at the same time, it has led to a reduction in the tax credits capitalised by North American Stainless derived from the tax credits established in this state and explained in section 18.3.2 of this note. The impact of this credit reduction amounted to 8,683 thousand euros.
Spain
A number of changes were approved in this year in relation to local corporate income tax law for the regions of Álava, Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa. The main changes affecting the Group are a reduction in the tax rate from 28% (hitherto in effect) to 26% applicable in 2018 and then 24% starting 2019. The Group has recognised in this year the impact the rate reduction will have on its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since the Group companies based on those regions have capitalised tax credits, the change has had a negative impact on their earnings. The Group has recognised an associated expense of Euro 497 thousand. Further developments include restrictions on the recovery of prior years' tax losses, which are now limited to 50% of the positive tax base generated in the year, while extending the recovery period to 30 years. Despite this limitation, the Group is confident that it will continue to recover prior years' tax losses within a period of 10 years.
There have been no significant tax changes in 2017 in Spain that alter the Group's tax burden.
Legislative amendments in other countries
In 2018 and 2017, the following tax rates applicable to certain Group companies were amended pursuant to local legislation:
- Malaysia: for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, the main amendment adopted is the time limit on the application of tax loss carryforwards. This limitation is established for a period of 7 years from 1 January 2019. The limitation does not apply to investment tax deductions or to non-applied temporary differences arising from different accounting and tax depreciation criteria. However, the Group has 294 million euros of unrecovered tax losses in that country, the associated tax credits are not capitalised and, therefore, the Group has not had to recognise any impairment arising from this limitation. On the other hand, the company Bahru Stainless has tax aid for investments made in the country during 2009-2014 amounting to 1,806 million Malaysian ringgits (381 million euros) that can continue to be applied indefinitely and also non utilised capital allowances for an amount of 371 million euros.
- France: A progressive reduction of taxes has been approved for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The general rate applicable until this year was 33.33%. The reform establishes that for tax benefits not exceeding 500,000 euros (after deduction of tax losses) the applicable rate will be 28% in 2018 (33.33% for the excess), 31% in 2019, 28% for all results generated in 2020, 26.5% in 2021 and 25% from 2022. The Group has known tax credits in this country and has updated them in accordance with the new rates. The negative impact recognised in the income statement for this year amounted to 1,207 thousand euros.
- Sweden: A reduction in the applicable tax rate from the current 22% to 21.4% by 2019 and 20.6% from 2020 has been approved. The Group has known tax credits in this country and has updated them in accordance with the new rates. The negative impact recognised in the income statement for this year amounted to 255 thousand euros.
As far as 2017 is concerned:
- L uxembourg. The tax rate was reduced from 29.22% to 26.01%. This rate reduction led to revenues of 1.2 million euros for the Group in that year, as the entity owned by the Group in this country has liabilities of 10 million euros from temporary differences.

Under heading "other taxes" of the income statement there are recognised withholding taxes at source either from interests paid to Group companies and also from dividends. In 2018 the Parent Company received dividends from some of its foreign subsidiaries amounting to 17.2 million euros (13.5 million euros in 2017). Under the corresponding double taxation conventions, some of these dividends were subject to withholdings at source amounting to 1,174 thousand euros (1,351 thousand euros in 2017). At the same time, this heading includes other withholdings at source made mainly in the payment of interest to Group companies, which are deductible on the income tax as a result of the application of the double taxation conventions and reduce the income tax expense.

The tax incentives not recognised in the income statement relate to tax credits for R&D&I activities and tax credits for the elimination of double taxation. In 2017, the deduction established for U.S. manufacturing companies ("Section 199 deduction") was also included.

The Group's tax expense has been affected by some extraordinary factors, although to a lesser extent than in 2017. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted this year to bring them into line with the new applicable tax rates, as explained in note 18.1. The combined impact of these adjustments has led to higher expenditure of 6.8 million euros. At the same time, the impact of the agreements reached as a result of the tax inspections completed during the year were recognised, which together amounted to 1.3 million euros in income tax. The details of these settings are explained in note 18.5.

With regard to 2017, there has been a positive impact from the tax adjustment for its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the United States as a result of the tax reform in that country, totalling 67.4 million euros. At the same time, the Group recognised provisions of 13.3 million euros as a result of tax assessments, as detailed in note 15.2. Finally, as explained in the section on deferred tax liabilities (note 18.3.1), the Group recognised a liability for the repatriation of reserves from its subsidiaries, totalling 26.7 million euros (1.7 million euros for the charge imposed in the United States for the non-distributed reserves of the American company's subsidiaries. (See note 18.1) and 25 million are explained in note 18.3.1). Without these effects, the tax rate for this year would have been 35%.

As laid down in the income tax measurement criteria (note 2.18), the Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so, the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis. The compensation of 32 million euros shown in the table above (35 million in 2017) corresponds mainly to the compensation of deferred tax liabilities of the Spanish consolidated tax of 20.6 million euros (24 million in 2017), as well as temporary differences of assets of the companies North American Stainless for 4.8 million euros (5.7 million in 2017) and Columbus Stainless 4 million euros (4.4 million euros).

18.3.1 Deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities recognised in property, plant and equipment are mainly due to the different tax and accounting depreciation criteria permitted by legislation in force in certain countries. These liabilities essentially relate to North American Stainless, Inc. and Columbus Stainless, Ltd.

With respect to the liability recorded as investments in subsidiaries, certain companies in the Consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to tax if distributed, since there are withholdings at source in certain legislation affecting the payment of dividends. The Group recognises the tax effect in this connection only when it considers that the distribution of these reserves in the form of dividends will be necessary in the foreseeable future, which will mean the reversal of the temporary difference. That is, when the parent entity has estimated that such gains will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, and therefore does not estimate that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future, it does not recognise a deferred tax liability.
Until 2017, Acerinox S.A., as the parent company of the Acerinox Group, did not consider it necessary to repatriate the reserves of its subsidiaries since it had sufficient reserves to meet dividend payments to its shareholders.
The Group has a shareholder dividend policy whereby the dividends are approved every year at the shareholders' general meeting, not subject to any criteria whereby a percentage of net benefit is distributed ("pay out"). The criteria adopted by Acerinox has always been to set remuneration levels in euros per share. This criterion has always been followed, even in years when losses were made. In the last twelve years, shareholder remuneration has remained at 0.45 euros per share, although during the 2013-2016 period, those shareholders who so requested were able to avail themselves of a "scrip dividend", receiving shares with an equivalent value from Acerinox. In addition, during the year, as explained in note 13.1, the Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. decided to propose to the next Ordinary General Meeting of the Company an 11% increase in shareholder remuneration by increasing the dividend per share from 0.45 to 0.50 euros.
An analysis of the holding company's financial position shows that in 2017, having distributed dividends over the last six years and charged them to reserves, it would be able to cover a repatriation of reserves from its subsidiaries for an amount of 250 million euros. This repatriation of reserves, combined with the holding's existing reserves, ensures that it can continue to cover share dividends for the next five years.
Although the Group does not have a policy of distributing dividends from subsidiaries to the parent company, every year the Group analyses the net worth of all its subsidiaries, also taking into account existing taxes, in order to determine the advisability of repatriation of dividends or reserves. As far as possible, the Group seeks to avoid the additional tax burden that may result from the distribution of dividends from countries

172

outside the European Union. The amount of accumulated reserves in countries where there is no tax on their distribution is 345 million, most of it corresponding to Acerinox Europe, whose current investment and operational needs make their distribution unfeasible.
At year-end, the only two companies with distributable reserves, whose distribution in the form of dividends could be subject to withholding, are North American Stainless and Columbus Stainless. The double taxation agreement between the United States and Spain establishes a withholding tax on distributed dividends of 10%, while the agreement between South Africa and Spain establishes a withholding tax of 5%.
In the case of Columbus, where Acerinox's stake is 76%, the amount of distributable reserves amounts to 81 million euros, but given its equity situation and the liquidity necessary to cover its operating and investment needs, it does not seem reasonable to believe that these profits will be distributed in the foreseeable future.
As far as the North American Stainless company is concerned, it has accumulated reserves of 1724 million euros. However, it does not consider that repatriation is necessary beyond the estimated 250 million and the Group therefore recognised a deferred tax liability of 25 million euros in 2017. This year the estimated amount has been re-evaluated, considering it appropriate to maintain it since, in view of the forecasts made over five years, the Group considers that any need beyond this time period analysed, can be covered by the results that the subsidiaries generate in the future. It does not seem likely that, beyond the current five-year period, it will be necessary to repatriate additional reserves from North American Stainless, so preferably, for the purpose of financial and tax optimisation, the Group will also try to cover its needs through dividends from subsidiaries that do not entail any additional tax burden.

18.3.2 Deferred tax assets At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group has unused tax credits from tax losses available as follows:

10,006 4,952 8,564 4,428 1,997
136,493

With regard to the tax credits available in Spain, the Group estimates that 3.3 million euros will be used this year, although the mutual agreements reached between Spain and Germany, which are explained in the note 18.5, have led to an increase in tax credits in Spain of 3.6 million euros. Additionally, as explained in note 18.1, changes in local tax laws, have led to a reduction of capitalised tax credits amounting to 0.5 million euros.

The tax credit reduction in Germany it's also a consequence of the Mutual Agreement Procedures reached between Germany and Spain.

The Group also has uncapitalised tax credits totalling 74,764 thousand euros in respect of certain Group companies' tax losses of euros 319 million (uncapitalised tax credits of 66,429 thousand euros in 2017 equivalent to losses of 284 million euros), which have not been recognised as they did not meet the necessary criteria. From this amount, 70,507 thousand euros have had a recovery period of 7 years, due to the tax reform approved in Malaysia and detailed in note 18.1. The rest have an unlimited recovery period.

The Group has assets for unrecognised temporary differences as a result of untaxed accounting impairment losses of 48.3 million euros (9.4 million euros the previous year), due to the recording of the impairment loss on the investment of Acerinox, S.A. in Bahu amounting to 155 million euros, which is explained in note 5.4 of these annual accounts.

On 22 June 2015, the Group company Bahru Stainless received confirmation from the Malaysian Ministry of Economy of approval of fiscal aid in respect of investments made in the country from 2009 to 2014. This aid consists of income tax deductions for an amount equal to the investments made in certain items of property, plant and equipment, which amount to 1,806 million Malaysian ringgits (381 million euros). As with tax credits

173

Consolidated Annual Accounts
relating to tax loss carryforward, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset as it cannot yet estimate their recoverability. Additionally, the Company has non utilised deferred tax liabilities available, due to the different tax and accounting depreciation criteria (capital allowances), for an amount of 371 million euros. These temporary differences have an unlimited utilisation period. Both aids will allow Bahru, not to pay taxes, once it generates tax profits, even considering the limitation introduced to compensate tax losses.
The Group company North American Stainless also has tax credits for investments in assets that contribute to recycling. These credits are deducted from the calculation of the Kentucky state tax and amounted to 511 million euros at the year end. During 2017, the Group obtained further tax credits of 50.8 million as a result of the new investments made in 2017, many of which qualified for tax relief. Of all the tax credits, 13.5 million euros expire in 2020, 20.8 million euros expire in 2028 and the rest are unlimited. Application of these credits is limited to 50% of the tax payable in the state of Kentucky, or an amount of USD 2.5 million/year. The Group only recognises a deferred tax asset for investment tax credits that expire and relate to a specific credit programme approved in 2005 by the state of Kentucky (Major Credits Program).
Given the limits established for their application, a portion of the deferred tax assets from investments which the Group had capitalised at 31 December 2016 (15 million euros) and which corresponded to those maturing in 2020, in view of the limitations established for their application, an amount of 5.2 million euros was irrecoverable at that date and, therefore, the Group recognised this amount against reserves.
With the estimates made at the close of 2017 to 10 years, the Group estimated that it could use an amount of 15.8 million euros and therefore recognised an asset for the difference. In 2018, following the approval of the Kentucky state tax reform and the reduction in the state tax rates, the amounts payable are reduced, which has forced the Group to re-estimate the recoverable amounts until 2028. The Group considers that of the 15.8 million USD it had capitalised at the end of 2017, only 5 will be recoverable and, therefore, it recognised an amount of 10 million USD (9 million euros) against profit for the year.
18.3.3 Analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group prepares projections of profit and loss on an individual basis for all companies with available tax credits to determine whether the credits will be recoverable within a reasonable timeframe and within the periods stipulated by respective legislation. To this end, the Group requests a budget covering five to ten years from each company with capitalised tax credits, for calculation of taxable bases in order to determine the recoverability of the tax credits. Furthermore, the Group takes into account the limitations regarding offsetting tax loss carryforwards stipulated in certain jurisdictions. The Group also assesses the existence of deferred tax liabilities against which tax losses may be offset in the future.
During the year the Group has continued to recover part of the capitalised tax credits and has not increased their amount in any of its subsidiaries.
In the preparation of budgets, the Group takes into account the financial and macroeconomic circumstances and those of the stainless steel market itself, adapted to the operating environment of each entity. Parameters such as expected growth, use of installed production capacity, prices, etc. are therefore projected considering historical figures, particularly the last year closed, as well as targets set by management. Key assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values at the time of the analysis.
The key hypotheses of the budgets are based on the recovery of the markets, especially the European one that has suffered a decrease of prices and increase of imports without precedents in the last half of the year 2018, due to the announcement (July 18) on the part of the European Commission of the provisional safeguard measures and the consequent called effect and acceleration of imports, which have reached 30%, being the historical maximum of market share.
In this context, the factors that have influenced sales prices have not been marked by the fluctuations of raw materials and their consequent effect of cyclicity on apparent consumption, but by the consequences of tariff barriers in different markets, which have affected the import flows in different markets, mainly in Europe, as we have said. However, a normalization of the supply-demand balance is expected due to the reaction adopted by the European Union.
The entry into force, on February 2, 2019, of the definitive safeguard measures (tariffs of 25%, according to quotas by importing countries, until June 2021) imposed by the European Commission, in response to the recently imposed US tariffs ( Section 232), already from the beginning, suppose a correction of several percentage points on the level of imports.
Regarding the growth of the apparent consumption of stainless steels, according to the estimates of the ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum), in their last revision of October 2018, they continue to be positive for the year 2019: Europe and Africa, +1.7 %, America + 3.6%, China + 6.4%, rest of Asia + 5.3% and the world + 5.0%.
With all these considerations, the estimates made for future years maintain operating margins with a positive trend, in line with those budgeted in the 2017 estimates and following the evolution of the global market for stainless steels, which, in 2018, continues to consolidate its historical growth rate with 5.9% in the period 1950-2018.
Based on all of the above aspects, and based on the budgets prepared, the Directors believe that, in spite of the new limits introduced in some jurisdictions, particularly in Spain, all capitalised tax credits are still likely to be recovered through future taxable income for all companies within a reasonable period of less than 10 years, and within the periods permitted by the corresponding local legislation in each country. The tax credits capitalised were the result of the crisis years and the Group has been reducing these credits since 2013.
On the basis of these estimates, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine the risk that a change in the assumptions may determine a need to impair part of these assets for deferred taxes.
174

With regard to the capitalised credits of the Spanish consolidated tax and which account for 84% of the capitalised tax credits of the Group, it is estimated that the projected results would have to worsen by more than 8% (7% over the 2017 budgets) in order for the recovery period to increase to 11 years. In addition, the estimation would have to be reduced by 18% (16% with budgets prepared in 2017) for the recovery period to increase to 12 years. The Group has also taken into account the possible impact in Spain of the increase in the tax losses pending application as a result of the mutual agreements reached as a result of the inspections opened in Italy, since those arising from the inspections in Germany have already been incorporated into the Spanish tax group since the results of the agreements reached have been notified by the Spanish tax authorities (both explained in note 18.5).
The Spanish consolidated tax group comprises Acerinox, S.A., Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A., Inoxfil, S.A., Inoxcenter, S.L.U. and Inoxcenter Canarias, S.A.U.
On regard to the Spanish companies not included in the tax consolidation scope which have tax credits of 3 million euros, and despite the limitations introduced by the new provincial laws approved, the Group has estimated its recoverability: In accordance with the 10-year budgets prepared for these companies the Group considers it is still probable that they will be recovered with future tax benefits in a reasonable period of less than 10 years.
Regarding Italy, while the Group considers that based on the 10-year budgets the recovery of the capitalised tax credits is possible, it is still uncertain the result of the mutual agreements to be reached between Spain and Italy, which will determine the amounts to be recovered in each country.
The Group has analysed the recoverability of other capitalised tax credits and reached conclusion that all are recoverable in a reasonable period of less than 10 years.
18.4 Current tax
At 31 December 2018 the Group has a current tax asset of 19,093 thousand euros (20,717 thousand euros in 2017) and a current tax liability of 23,576 thousand euros (21,212 thousand euros in 2017).
18.5 Tax inspections and years open to inspection
18.5.1 Tax inspection Developments in 2018
· The most significant advance during this fiscal year was the finalisation of the mutual agreements between Spain and Germany, which enable the complete elimination of double taxation between the two countries. An agreement was also finalised between the Acerinox Deutschland, Gmbh Group entity and the German tax authorities, which allows the adjustments arising from transactions with related entities from other countries to be reduced under the same conditions as those of the agreements reached with Spain. The Group has recognised in this period the impacts arising from the agreements that caused a tax receivable in Spain of 3.8 million plus 1.4 in interest. The Group has also recognised a total of Euro 3.7 million in tax credits recoverable in Spain. All these amounts has been recognised as income in this year. In Germany, the tax credits that were capitalised for 10 million euros were eliminated; 0.3 million euros was reversed from receivables, recorded for amounts previously paid; and the tax provision provided in the previous year was reversed, which amounted to 6 million euros. The net impact of all these adjustments has been a positive result of 4.6 million euros, of which 2.3 million euros appear as financial income.
In this period, in addition, the Bilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement between Spain and Germany was signed, covering the period from 2013 to 2021 and providing all the security to the Group in relation to the transfer pricing policy to be applied to the transactions of purchase and sale between the Spanish factories and the German subsidiary, thus eliminating the risks for transfer prices with this country.
· In the case of Portugal, the Portuguese tax authorities have paid a total of 678 thousand euros, which includes the outstanding principal plus interest. Since the Group had already recognised the amounts to be recovered, the payment has had no significant impact on the accounts.
· In Italy, new assessments have been received for the financial year 2013 from which adjustments amounting to 3 million euros and a payable amount of 1 million euros are derived.
The Group has followed the same procedures as in the past: the corresponding appeals have been lodged in Italy, the suspension of the debt has been requested and the requests for the elimination of double taxation have been submitted in both Spain and Italy. In addition, in December 2018, the request for the elimination of double taxation with South Africa was presented in Italy for the procedures opened for the years 2011 to 2013.
This year the amount of the provision has been re-estimated and as a result of the last minutes received it has been necessary to increase it by 620 thousand euros. The provision therefore amounts to 7.8 million euros.
· In Spain, it has been notified the commencement of verification and investigation inspections in the companies Acerinox, S.A, Acerinox Europa, Inoxcenter and Roldan. Tax audit is currently in progress.
175

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The situation with regard to each of the tax inspections that are underway or which have concluded but are being disputed and appealed against at the end of 2018 is detailed below:

Spain
On 17 October 2018 it has been notified of the commencement of verification and investigation inspections in the companies Acerinox, S.A, Acerinox Europa, Inoxcenter and Roldan of the following taxes and periods:

Income tax Value added tax Personal income tax Withholdings on account taxation for non-residents

2013 to 2016 10/2014 to 12/2016 10/2014 to 12/2016 10/2014 to 12/2016

So far all the required information has been submitted.
On 26 July of 2017, notification was received of the start of customs-related inspection proceedings (VAT import duties) in relation to 2015. On 3 November the assessment was approved and signed without any adjustments, bringing the procedure to an end.
On 7 January 2016, the Economic-Administrative Tribunal issued a ruling upholding in full the submissions filed by Acerinox, S.A. against the assessment decisions arising from the inspection of rights, anti-dumping and VAT for 2009, 2010 and 2011. On 27 April of the same year, agreements to enforce the rulings were received for the amounts of 925 thousand euros in respect of anti-dumping, which had previously been guaranteed, 649 thousand euros for VAT on imports (which had been deducted by Acerinox at the time) and 41 thousand euros in respect of payable external tariffs. The Company filed an appeal against the assessment decisions, contesting the interest calculation. 61 thousand euros relating to guarantee expenses were also recovered. On 26 September 2018 we are notified of the payment of 10 thousand euros of additional interest, which ends the procedure.
Portugal
In the year 2011, tax inspections were conducted in the Group company Acerol Ltda., in Portugal, on taxes for the years 2007 and 2008. They resulted in a transfer pricing adjustment for sale and purchase transactions between the company Acerol, Ltda and Group companies, primarily Acerinox, S.A. and Roldán, S.A in Spain. The adjustment to taxable income amounted to 10 million euros. However, as the subsidiary had tax losses of 6.7 million euros pending offset, the amount paid totalled 708 thousand euros. On 31 July 2012 an application was submitted to the Directorate-General for Taxation through the European Arbitration Convention based on Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990. This Convention guarantees the elimination of double taxation due to transfer pricing adjustments within the European Union.
On 28 December 2016, the affected Spanish companies received the notifications relating to the agreement reached between the Spanish and Portuguese authorities that finalised the mutual agreement procedure. On 17 January 2017 the same agreement was received by the Portuguese company. Under this agreement, the Spanish and Portuguese authorities accepted the complete elimination of the double taxation.
Under these agreements, pursuant to the assessments, the adjustment made in relation to Acerol by the competent Portuguese authority was reduced from a total of 10 million euros to 4 million euros for 2007 and 720 thousand euros for 2008. At the same time, the competent Spanish authorities made a correlative adjustment of the same amount in relation to the various Spanish Group companies affected. In 2016, the Group recognised the refundable amounts in Spain, which amounted to 1.3 million euros, in addition to an increase in tax credits amounting to 179 thousand euros. At the same time, the Portuguese entity recognised a refundable amount of 0.6 million euros.
On June 2017, the Spanish Tax Agency executed the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) reached by which the Group recovered in Spain the amounts provided for, plus 254 thousand euros of interest, which were recognised as income in the year.
In 2018, the Portuguese tax authorities have paid a total of 678 thousand euros, which includes the outstanding principal plus interest. Since the Group had already recognised the amounts to be recovered, the payment has had no significant impact on the accounts.
Germany
As regards the tax inspections for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 that were initiated in 2011 at the Group subsidiary Acerinox Deutschland, GmbH, the assessments of the income tax, solidarity surcharge and VAT were received on 8 July 2014. The assessments primarily indicated transfer pricing adjustments to the tax base totalling 58.8 million euros for sale and purchase transactions between the subsidiary and the Group's manufacturing companies. No penalties were imposed. The company filed the pertinent submissions on 8 August 2014.
The amount payable in Germany, as a result of the assessments, was 2,804 thousand euros for income tax plus the solidarity surcharge and 489 thousand euros in interest. All negative tax loss carryforwards yet to be offset were also eliminated. These amounts were paid in 2014. Subsequently, since the adjustments arising from the assessments eliminated all existing tax loss carryforwards, the authorities have claimed taxes on the results generated in all subsequent years. The total amounts paid amount to 8.8 million euros which were recognised in Germany as accounts receivable as they were considered likely to be recovered following the request for elimination of double taxation.
In November 2015 requests were submitted for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Germany. Any adjustment relating to transfer prices for transactions completed with companies resident in Spain is protected by Convention 90/436/EEC on the elimination of double taxation.
On 5 October 2017, we were informed of the finalisation of the mutual agreement procedure and the agreements reached for the years 2007-2010. These agreements entailed a 40% reduction in adjustments relating to transactions between Spain and the German subsidiary. The tax recovered

176

in Spain this year, as a consequence of the agreements, has amounted to 3.8 million euros, plus 1.4 million euros in interest, all of which has been recognised as income. The Group has also recognised a total of Euro 3.7 million in tax credits recoverable in Spain. With regard to Germany, the agreements reached with Spain have been executed, but without extending the same criteria to transactions with third countries, which entails a recovery in Germany of 6.4 million euros, previously recognised as an account receivable, and the elimination of all the tax losses pending recovery for which tax credits amounting to 10 million euros had been capitalised.
In a meeting with the German tax authorities on 10 December, it was agreed to transfer the agreements reached with Spain in the MAP to transactions with third countries, leading to an additional reduction in adjustments of 1.6 million euro in Germany. The Group estimates that it will recover an additional 2 million euros after these agreements.
The execution of the last agreements reached is pending, although the Group has already acknowledged all the impacts, as explained under note of developments in 2018.
On the other hand, on 29 November 2016, notification was given of the commencement of tax inspections for the years 2011-2014. The authorities decided to postpone their proceedings on transfer prices until the proposed mutual agreement has been settled. Following the meeting held in December, it is agreed to close these exercises without making any additional adjustments.
A bilateral pricing agreement has also been signed this year between Spain and Germany, covering the period running from 2013 to 2021. If offers the Group complete security in relation to the transfer price policy it is to apply to purchase and sale transactions between the Spanish factories and the German subsidiary, thus eliminating transfer price risks with Germany. Under this agreement, the Grupo has had to present additional tax returns in Spain for 2013 to 2016, in which it has increased its tax bases by Euro 1.2 million. These adjustments have generated an additional Euro 124 thousand payable in taxes. Meanwhile, the German authorities have made the same adjustment, but this time to lower the tax bases declared in the country. As a result, a total of Euro 498 thousand in taxes has been repaid in Germany.
Italy
In 2011 the subsidiary Acerinox Italia S.r.l. underwent an inspection of taxes for 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Between 2012 and 2014 the assessment notices for the three years were received, primarily indicating transfer pricing adjustments in relation to sale and purchase transactions between the Company and the Group's factories. The resulting payable tax amounted to 16 million euros, plus 3.5 million euros in interest. No penalties were imposed.
There have been the following developments in relation to the assessments: The company challenged these assessments in appeals filed by the respective deadlines before the provincial tax commission of Milan, in which it was also requested that stays be placed on the tax debt until completion of the proceedings. These stays were accepted by the Italian authorities, subject to the pledging of bank guarantees for an initial amount of 7.9 million euros. Furthermore, on 9 December 2013 an application was submitted to the Spanish authorities requesting the elimination of double taxation based on Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990. This Convention guarantees the elimination of double taxation due to transfer pricing adjustments within the European Union. Following negotiations between the Spanish and Italian taxation authorities, or an arbitrator's ruling if necessary, this initial adjustment, or whichever adjustment is agreed, will therefore be offset by a counter-adjustment in the other member state. The Spanish Directorate-General for Taxation and the Italian authorities have confirmed their acceptance of the initiation of the procedure. The initiation of the mutual agreement procedure allows the taxpayer to reduce the bank guarantees provided. The Group has reduced the guaranteed amounts to 1.3 million euros.
Italian legislation requires that internal appeals be withdrawn to accept the international arbitration proceedings to eliminate double taxation. Therefore, after it was announced that the proceedings had been accepted, the Group withdrew the internal claims relating to transactions with countries in the European Union.
On 28 December 2016, and with no prior notification of the initiation of inspection procedures, the Company received an assessment relating to transfer prices for the year 2011, automatically applying similar criteria to previous inspections. This led to adjustments in the tax base of 4.3 million euros, yielding a payable amount of 1.5 million euros plus interest. No penalties were imposed. On 26 May, the relevant arguments were submitted to the Italian tax authorities. In July 2017 we were informed of the temporary suspension of debt repayment without submitting any bank guarantee. In November 2017, requests were submitted for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Italy.
Likewise, in November 2017, with no prior notification of the commencement of tax inspections, the company Acerinox Italia received a further assessment of transfer prices relating to 2012, giving rise to adjustments to the tax base of 4.9 million euros and an amount payable of 1.6 million euros, plus interest. Also in this year new assessments have been received for the financial year 2013 from which adjustments amounting to 3 million euros and a payable amount of 1 million euros are derived.
The Group has followed the same procedures as in the past: the corresponding appeals have been lodged in Italy, the suspension of the debt has been requested and the requests for the elimination of double taxation have been submitted in both Spain and Italy. In addition, in December 2018, the request for the elimination of double taxation with South Africa was presented in Italy for the procedures opened for the years 2011 to 2013.
In view of the agreements reached concerning Germany, the Group, based also on the opinion of the independent experts who advise it in these proceedings, considers it probable that after the negotiation of the agreements, there will be some amount to be regularised by Italian taxation authorities to adjust certain amounts, mainly resulting from tax rate differences between both countries and the transfer pricing adjustments originating from transactions made in third countries. The Group therefore considered it necessary to provide for an amount of 7 million euros, corresponding to the maximum risk resulting from the proposed adjustments and relating to the financial years 2007 to 2012. This year the amount of the provision has been re-estimated and as a result of the last minutes received it has been necessary to increase it by 620 thousand euros. The provision therefore amounts to 7.8 million euros.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The Group is awaiting the start of negotiations between the Italian and Spanish authorities, which will eventually enable the Group to eliminate the double taxation deriving from the transfer price proceedings for 2007 through to 2013.

Poland
On 2 December 2016 notification was received of the commencement of tax inspections at the Acerinox Group company Polska Sp. Zoo for income tax for 2015. The corporate income tax inspection was completed this year without any significant adjustments for the Group. The company is required to pay additional tax of Euro 90 thousand this year, plus Euro 16 thousand in interest.

Malaysia
On 24 and 28 December 2014, notice was received of the start of a tax inspection of the Group company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. for the years 2010 and 2011. Subsequently, on 4 March 2015, notification was received that the inspection was to be extended to 2012 and 2013. All requested information has been submitted to date. On 23 February 2017, notification was received of the resumption of the tax inspections, but for the years 2010-2014, without there having been any request for additional information since then.

In addition, on 20 January 2015 notification was received of the commencement of an inspection of the company Acerinox SC Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. in relation to transfer prices in the period from 2010 to 2013. All the information requested has been submitted and, to date, no report on the findings has been received which would allow conclusions to be reached with regard to any adjustments. The Group has responded to all the questions raised so far.

South Africa
On 24 June 2014, notice was received of the initiation of a tax inspection on transfer prices for 2010 to 2012 at the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty) Ltd. In 2015 the assessments were received, finalising the inspections. The assessments stipulated adjustments to taxable income in relation to transfer prices, amounting to 32 million euros. These adjustments did not result in any payable amounts in South Africa, as the company had carried forward tax losses which exceeded the amount of the assessment. The assessments did not impose any penalties.

Subsequent to the filing of the related submissions within the periods established, in 2016 the Company was notified of the possibility of engaging in alternative proceedings to resolve the dispute related to 2010 by appointing an independent arbitrator ("Alternative Dispute Resolution"). The company considered it appropriate to exhaust all options prior to resorting to the courts. The outcome of the procedure was highly satisfactory for the Company, as it received notification from the South African tax authorities (SARS) on 7 February 2017 agreeing to eliminate all proposed adjustments relating to 2010. The notification also validated the transfer price policy put in place by the Group. In October 2017 notification was also received that the SARS had agreed to withdraw all proposed adjustments for the years 2011 and 2012.

France
On 29 November 2016 the Group company Acerinox France, S.A.S was notified of the commencement of a verification of the tax returns for 2014 and 2015. The procedures were completed in 2017 without significant adjustments.

Switzerland
During 2017, inspections were carried out in the Switzerland subsidiary for the years 2012-2015. The inspection was concluded without any adjustments.

18.5.2. Years open to inspection
In accordance with current legislation, taxes cannot be considered definitive until the submitted tax returns have been inspected by the tax authorities or until the inspection period has elapsed.

Spain
Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law, tax loss carryforwards declared in the tax returns for years open to inspection become statute-barred ten years from the day following the deadline for filing the tax return or self-assessment for the tax period in which the right to offset arises. Once this period has elapsed, taxpayers must submit the assessment or self-assessment and the accounting records, as well as evidence that they have been filed at the Mercantile Registry during the aforementioned period, in order to demonstrate that these tax loss carryforwards and the amount thereof are appropriate.

At 31 December 2018 and 2017, Acerinox, S.A. and the companies in the consolidated tax group have all the main applicable taxes open to inspection by the tax authorities for the following years:

NOTE 21 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Exchange of shares of Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd As explained in note 11.2.5, as of 26 December 2018, Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. is no longer listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange following its acquisition by Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation. The shares owned by Acerinox, S.A. in Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd. (1%) will be exchanged effective 1 January 2019 for shares of the acquiring company at an exchange rate of 0,71 shares of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation for each share of Nisshin Steel Co, Ltd.; i.e. Acerinox, S.A. will receive 747,346 shares of the acquiring company.
The exchange will result in the derecognition of the shares held by Acerinox, S.A. at fair value through other comprehensive income, and a recognition of the new shares for the same amount. The amount recognised in other comprehensive income, which at 31 December 2018 amounted to -5,023 thousand euros, will not be reclassified to the income statement, as required by the new IFRS-9, but will be transferred to a distributable reserves account.
Safeguard measures on steel imports adopted by the European Union On 1 February, the European Commission announced the definitive safeguard measures, with some relevant changes with respect to the provisional measures which entered into force on July 2018 and that all together should have an impact on the European market.
Firstly, these measures include more types of products, which referring to stainless steel entails the inclusion of plates, being thus included in the measures all the finished products, both flat and long.
Secondly, quotas are not global but rather tax quotas by country for the main origins have been applied, what supposes a relevant limitation of Asian imports which are the ones having a worse effect on prices; it should be as well considered the possibility of some countries not covering their quotas, such as it is the case of the USA, affected by the reprisal measures of the EU.
Thirdly, the boarding clause which gave place to a relevant increase of imports in the summer 2018, in line with the increase of boardings in anticipation to the measures, is no longer applicable.
Considering the established quotas, which depart from the imports average for 2015-2017, we estimate an imports correction around 15% with which we would retrieve back to 2016 levels, what in addition to a sustained growth of European demand would help European manufacturers recovering part of their market share, reducing the imports quota in a 25% for flat product in comparison with the nearly 30% reached in 2018.
It is worth noting that in November 2018 the Commission announced the exclusion of South Africa from the measures, reason why Columbus Stainless won't be affected by them.
Acquisition of Treasury shares The Board of Directors of Acerinox held on 19 December 2018, making use of the authorisation granted for a period of five years by the General Meeting of the Company held in June 2014, and pursuant to the provisions of article 17 of Regulation (EU) no. 596/2014 on Market Abuse, has approved a First Share Repurchase Programme with the aim of reducing the share capital of Acerinox, S.A. through the redemption of its own shares, if the General Meeting so approves, in order to improve earnings per share.
At the preparation date of this financial statements, the Company has acquired, under the First Share Repurchase Programme, 3,979,471 shares for an amount of 36.7 million euros.
Bahru Stainless's capital increase. The Board of Directors, at its session held on 26 February, has resolved to increase Bahru Stainless Sdn, Bhd capital, without cash injection, through the capitalization of 335.5 million USD from the loan granted by Acerinox, S.A to its subsidiary. This solution has been adopted after Acerinox, S.A. acquired, last December 30% of shareholding held by Nisshin Steel in Bahru. Acerinox currently holds a 97% of Bahru Stainless shares.

1.1 Risks and their Management
Acerinox has a Risk Management Model for identifying, classifying, and evaluating any possible event that could affect all the units and significant functions of the organisation as well as establishing the control and responsibility mechanisms derived from each one of them. The Model has as the ultimate objective of providing reasonable security for attaining objectives, whether strategic, operational, compliance, or reporting.

For the correct implementation of the measures and the strict monitoring of its fulfilment of them in each of the possible risks, in 2015 the Group approved the Risk Management Control Policy of Acerinox, S.A., and their Group of Companies.

Through the Policy, the mechanisms and basic principles are established for the management of opportunities and risks that allow them to:
· Achieve the strategic objectives determined by the Group. · Provide full guarantees for the shareholders. · Protect the Group's results and reputation. · Defend the interests of the key Interest Groups of the Company. · Ensure business stability and financial solidity in a sustained manner over time.

Any business activity generally has a series of risks associated to it and, in the case of steel making, Acerinox recognises and classifies the uncertainties characteristic of the industry in which it operates.

Moreover, the substantial risks facing the Company on a daily basis requiring full-time management and special surveillance are inter-related and can be summarised in the following diagram:

1.2 General Policies
Acerinox has eight general policies that define the general guidelines of the Company and its Group of companies in the following matters which correspond to their heading and content:
· General Policy for Selection of Directors · General Policy of Corporate Social Responsibility · General Policy for the Remuneration of Directors · General Policy for Risk Management and Control · General Policy for Communication and Contact with Shareholders and Investors · General Tax Policy · General Corporate Governance Policy · General Treasury Stock Policy
All these policies are available on the Company's website so that they can viewed and compared by any interested party and can be found within the Corporate Governance section / General Policies.
2. Materiality Analysis
The result of the analysis of the relevant issues identified in 2018 is represented in the following materiality matrix:
This exercise is the second materiality analysis conducted by the Acerinox Group to identify and prioritise, among others, the environmental, social and governance issues that are relevant for the company and for the design and the definition of the contents of its Sustainability Report for the 2018 financial year. This analysis follows the new legal requirements under Spanish legislation on the subject of non-financial information reports and the requirements of the latest version of the GRI standards (SRS Standards of the GRI) that establish the principle of materiality as one of the key aspects in order to determine the content to report with regards non-financial information.
Within this process, the material aspects have been prioritised in two areas: internal and external. To do this, we have received the valuation from various professional profiles and managers of the Group from various departments and countries, and on the external side, the identification of relevant issues has been considered through a study of influencers (such as the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, UNESID, among others) in the industry and renowned analysts in ESG aspects.

3. Environmental Matters
3.1 Environmental Matters
Sustainability and taking care of the environment are among the priorities of the company, and Acerinox understands their importance for an organisation that has the intention to maintain its position and endure into the future.
Acerinox is committed to the environment and its surrounding areas, to reducing environmental impact during the production process, to collaborating with the communities in which it operates and, of course, to its employees and stakeholders.
This effort has been recognised by organisations such as FTSE4Good, which includes the Acerinox Group in its global assessment index of responsible companies that demonstrate their application of solid environmental measures and corporate social responsibility and recognises companies who work towards environmental sustainability.
During the development of production and waste management, the precautionary principle against environmental risks is applied along with measures to prevent and, if necessary, react quickly to a potential hazard to health or the environment.
The environmental risks are contained in the operational risks section of Acerinox, S.A.'s Risk Control and Management Policy.
Acerinox's activity requires large energy consumption and emissions are linked to its productive capacity. Therefore, the company's efforts are aimed at reducing emissions and putting the most suitable filters in place before allowing these emissions to be released. In this task, the reduction of CO2 emissions implies a constant commitment, both from Acerinox itself, and from a sustainable industry which is committed to the fight against climate change.
Additionally, stainless steel is a metal that is recycled almost in its entirety and indefinitely, so it is indefinitely reusable and requires much less energy to manufacture than other similar materials, such as aluminium or titanium; also, it does not require chemicals for its correct storage.
The main raw material for the manufacture of stainless steel in our plants comes from scrap; therefore, Acerinox is one of the largest recyclers of this waste product in all the countries in which it has steelworks.
The areas of application of stainless steel are almost unlimited and demand has steadily and increasingly grown in recent decades, with rates of increase of an average of approximately 6% each year, it is also a fundamental pillar of the circular economy.
The applications of stainless steel include quite a few utilities related to the environment such as generating clean energy and saving on energy consumption, providing clean air, water treatment, producing healthy food, avoiding hazardous chemicals and limiting environmental pollution.
With regards to the environmental provisions, the Group has not registered any environmental provisions for 2018.
188

Stainless Steel reinforced bars in the construction of the "Sagrada Familia"
3.2 Climate Change
As mentioned in the first point of this report, Acerinox is recognised in the global Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and is included in the B List of leading companies in the fight against climate change through the implementation of activities to reduce emissions and minimise the risks of the organisation in relation to climate change.
The Group is well-aware of the Sustainable Development Goals of the European Union, including the fight against climate change and the effects resulting from it.
At Acerinox we are committed to maintaining scrupulous care of the environment surrounding our production facilities and offices, to continue investing in research and technology to reduce energy consumption and emissions from our activities and waste as much as possible, to defend and promote respect for biodiversity in all its aspects and to strengthen the role of Corporate Social Responsibility within the Group and the companies which form it.
3.3 Pollution
The manufacturing process for stainless steel requires an intensive use of energy. The Acerinox Group is strongly committed to reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. To do this, all operations are characterised for their operational excellence, in pursuit of technological efficiency and continuous optimisation of the facilities, making Acerinox one of the most efficient companies in its commitment to the reduction of emissions, according to the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF).
The Acerinox Group plants have strict measures in place to prevent, avoid, and resolve spillages from tipping or storing substances.
189

Non-financial Information record

The Group's production activities are subject to strict emission controls, as well as the fulfilment of yearly objectives. In 2020, the period for recording the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) comes to an end in Europe and over the next few years the rights to free emissions are going to be reduced. By following the recommendations from the various international regulations, the Acerinox Group can calculate the direct and indirect emissions.
Acerinox has control, measurement, and gas filtering systems in all of its equipment and takes special care to comply in this field. Proof of this is found in the fact that in order to reduce NOx emissions, the plants have catalytic towers, where NOx vapours are converted into molecular nitrogen, so that the NOx emissions are well below the strict legal limits.

Acerinox 2017 = 298 Mt 2018 = 240 Mt

NOx emissions

Nas 2017 = 382 Mt 2018 = 367 Mt

Columbus 2017 = 98 Mt 2018 = 115 Mt

Bahru 2017 = 46 Mt 2018 = 71 Mt

The company is aware that through its Zero Emissions Target programme, a conception of environmental policy entails the constant target of reducing all emissions to the extent possible, in absolute terms and in relative terms or specific ones. The ZET is a constant battle which stems from the Company's own initiative, rather than from a regulatory imperative.

Table 1 Scope 1 Direct GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent:

The new production systems come with the most advanced technologies and emission reduction systems incorporated in them. Thus, in Acerinox Europe investments totalling 9 million were approved for the acquisition of a ladle furnace and a refrigerated vault to reduce the consumption by the refractory, electrodes, emissions and increase in the availability time of the furnace.

Meanwhile, Columbus Stainless spent more than 14 million on the installation of a cutting line and ladle furnace, which as in the aforementioned case, reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

2017  6,859,522  88,994,572  95,854,094

The plants have implemented the following specific measures with the aim of reducing emissions:
· Replacing the conventional burner with an oxy-fuel burner AOD-1 and AOD-2. · Increase in the continuous loads and direct annealing, installation and economiser of boiler 3. · Saving electricity in stoppages for the application of protocol in the Steelworks, Hot Rolling, and Cold
Rolling. · Replacement LEDs, replacement ZM-3 motors and regulation of the Laminar Flow pump. · The "Green Weekend" which represents a reduction in the load based on unused units has meant a
reduction in scope 1 emissions of 820 MtCO2, and 7,261 Mt CO2 eq. in scope 2 emissions. · Varied fan speed system in the Induction Air fans of the filter room which has thereby reduced to
13,726 Mt CO2 eq. · Optimisation programme for gas consumption processes and other services which have obtained a
reduction of 194 Mt CO2 eq. in Scope 1 emissions. · Optimisation of power consumption and LED project through which group 2 emissions have been
reduced by 5,553 Mt CO2 eq.
Acerinox Europe also shows its commitment to reducing light pollution by replacing their conventional lighting to one with greater energy efficiency and which causes less impact. To do this, the fluorescent ceiling lights have been changed for LED screens in offices and laboratories, and the metal halide projectors have been replaced with LED projectors in the light towers of the port. A similar process has been undertaken at the Roldan plant where the existing halide light fixtures were changed for LED downlights and projectors in all the transit roads and external manufacturing workshop areas.

3.4 Circular Economy
As a leading company in the metal industry in general, and in particular in the stainless steel industry, Acerinox, is one of the most noteworthy examples in practising circular economy. Acerinox plays an active role within the Spanish Covenant on the Circular Economy, which it signed (along with other companies in the industry) in 2017, becoming the first industry in Spain in which all companies are committed to the transition towards a sustainable model. This commitment means maintaining the value of products, materials, and resources for as long as possible, minimising the generation of waste and promoting the proper treatment and recycling of this waste. The Acerinox Group plants have strict measures in place to prevent, avoid, and resolve spillages from tipping or storing substances. All the plants have neutralisation plants for treating acidic and basic waste water as well as emergency dams and other security mechanisms for containing any possible spillages. Similarly, the tanks are also equipped with a rigid inner tank, with an emergency stop function and an emergency cleaning service. The manufacturing process of stainless steel at Acerinox begins with the melting of scrap (primarily) which, after treatment and the application of the necessary processes, becomes a metal which has many different applications in various industries and, with proper maintenance, it has a useful lifespan which can last for centuries and which leaves a considerably smaller footprint than other alloy emissions. In economic terms, it converts a product of little value into one of great value that will be recycled once again at the end of its useful life, creating jobs in the process, taking care of the environment and thereby polluting the planet even less, thereby closing the perfect economic circle.

Since the creation of the Group, tens of millions of tonnes of scrap have been recycled in the Acerinox Group melting shops, which in 1970 had already created a Circular Economy with its associated benefits.

In promoting the circular economy in its processes, the Acerinox Group signed an agreement with the General Foundation of the Spanish National Research Council (FGCSIC in its Spanish initials) based on the ComFuturo programme to encourage excellence in youth research aimed at achieving progress and improvements in stainless steel production processes. Together, they are developing a project involving the revaluation of slag metal by applying a treatment to it in order to use it in various building materials which allows harmful gases to be converted into harmless ones.

Within the aim to promote a circular economy and in relation to the use and waste management, it is essential to assess the impact of the entire product life cycle, from the manufacturing process to the end of its useful life.

193

To do this, the Company participates in the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) promoted by Eurofer (European Steel Association). This is an internationally recognised, structured method to quantify the emissions, the resources consumed as well as the impact on the environment and health, related to the products placed on the market. The scope of the method encompasses the extraction of the raw materials right through to the useful life of the product.

3.5 Sustainable Use of Resources

The activities developed by the Acerinox Group require a considerable amount of both solid and liquid materials and resources.
One of the most abundant and noteworthy of these is water consumption. Given the large amount of water needed for production, Acerinox invests major resources and efforts in reducing consumption and therefore costs, recovering suspended metals which are derivatives of the production processes and returning as much water as possible back to the environment, in the same condition of purity, quality, and temperature in which it was taken.
Consumption varies substantially between plants due to the differences in air temperature, the different refrigeration requirements of the equipment, and the products which are manufactured.
The volume of water catchment in areas with no shortages in the four main plants are as follows:
Table 5 Volume of water catchment in areas with no shortages:

Volume (m3) Surface water Third-party companies' water Total

2018 3,417,818 m3 233,352 m3 3,651,170 m3

All the plants have neutralisation plants for treating acidic and basic waste water as well as emergency dams and other security mechanisms for containing any possible spillages. Similarly, the tanks are also equipped with a rigid inner tank, with an emergency stop function and an emergency cleaning service.

The proliferation of control systems and efforts in the monitoring of any toxic materials or pollutants has allowed the Group to reach high levels of management in this area.

A vast percentage of the components that make up the stainless steel manufactured by Acerinox comes from recycled materials. A fact that shows the value of the decision to install electric-arc furnaces for melting the scrap, not only for being a decision which is more environmentally advanced but also for being economically

194

more efficient: scrap is raw material which receives a major discount on the aggregate value of the metals that it incorporates. If there is an example of how being environmentally responsible can be more economically beneficial to the Company, this is it.

The total fuel consumption from renewable and non-renewable sources at the four main plants according to the type of fuels used during 2018 has been as follows:

3.6 Protecting Biodiversity
The activity carried out at all of the Acerinox plants surpasses the environmental legislation of each country in which it produces while demonstrating an attitude of scrupulous care for the environment.
The Acerinox plants in Europe, North American Stainless, and Bahru Stainless have their facilities based at sea or river ports which have direct access to their waters. Acerinox only pours pre-treated water, which has had all of the waste that may be unsafe removed from it, into these waters.
Therefore, the activities and operations carried out by Acerinox have no direct influence on biodiversity and protected areas.

With regard to the average remuneration data by job category, it should be noted that most of the administrative staff work at the Barhu plant.
The "know-how" and knowledge of Group's employees represent a competitive difference for Acerinox. The years of experience and training are essential to achieve a product of the highest quality, optimise production, and reduce costs. This is why the company is committed to training new recruits in a constant process aimed at excellence, the assimilation of the Group's values and its competitive nature.
Acerinox does not have any specific measures in place with regards to disconnecting from work out-of-hours

Acerinox's care and respect towards its employees the conditions in which they undertake their activity can also be noted with regard to its personnel with disabilities.

At the Acerinox Europe plant there are 40 employees who have an officially recognised permanent disability.

A total of 29 employees are recognised as having a Total Permanent Disability according to the resolution of the National Institute of Social Security and the other 11 cases through the Andalusian Institute of Social Services. Such circumstances therefore affect about 2% of the workforce. In the case of Spain, Acerinox also complies with the Law on Social Integration of the Disabled (LISMI in its Spanish initials).

4.2 Organisation of the Working Schedule
The organisation of the working schedule for over 85% of the Acerinox staff is to cover the activity carried out at the plants. At the large production centres, the shifts are divided into three groups of eight hours each or two groups of 12 hours (at NAS), depending on the agreement with the workers' representatives, so that the activity at the plants (unless in exceptional cases) does not stop completely at any time and there are always managers present to ensure the safety and proper functioning of the processes.

The opportunities, training and employee remuneration are designed to promote the competitive nature of the organisation, regardless of gender or any other characteristics that are not related to the professional criteria.

The company is continuing to work on encouraging the conciliation personal and professional lives of the employees of the Group, as well as to incorporate new practices which allow them to disconnect from work during non-work hours. Similarly, pregnancy periods, maternity and paternity leave and the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks are respected beyond the applicable laws and their application is facilitated based on the employee's needs.

4.3 Health and Safety
The Board of Directors, the Senior Management at Acerinox, and the Management teams of each of the plants and the Health and Safety Committees allocate the necessary means to ensure the best safety conditions for the employees carrying out each of the activities. Given that the activity of the company is not without risks, the aim is to reduce these risks and mitigate their consequences. For this reason, Acerinox applies its own rigorous regulations that go far beyond that required by the law in force.

Therefore, the company makes an effort to comply with the regulations in this field, paying particular attention to any incident and keeping updated with regards to information on any developments in this field. If any incident should occur, the Group applies the relevant protocols, carefully studying the reasons and, if necessary, immediately applying the necessary corrective measures to prevent the incident from reoccurring. As a result of this rigorous risk monitoring, the number of accidents occurring at all of the group's plants has steadily decreased in the last few years.

Moreover, Acerinox requires that the subcontracted companies working in its facilities accept the requirements established by the Group. Thus, Acerinox determines the models, standards, and certifications applicable to the workers in all its centres.

201

Non-financial Information record

The Group offers first aid and workplace safety courses at its production centres, and has an ongoing programme that analyses possible workplace risks and studies any existing factors that could cause them. All incidents are investigated and analysed, and the best solutions are sought in order to prevent them from reoccurring.

At the plants, Acerinox Europe exceeds compliance with the legislation that is required from the Group, giving thousands of hours of training in health and safety and the ACero campaign, designed to raise awareness of the legislation and enforcement of Health and Safety rules. As regards the NAS plant, it continues with its Zero Tolerance policy. Columbus also applies its own Safety Management System, while also complying with the standards contained in the Occupational Health and Safety Law.

Bahru Stainless has a Health and Safety Committee that inspects and assesses the potential risks with its General Safety Induction programme in the prevention or treatment in the event of an accident.

4.4 Social Relations
Acerinox advocates and facilitates the right of free association of employees and maintains constructive relations with its workers and their representatives in each of its centres.

The agreements and agreed working conditions were fundamental to traverse the toughest years of the economic recession and are being very useful in trying to reach guarantees with regards to the future challenges facing the company.

Health and Safety Committees have been set up in each of the plants with whom workers can clarify any doubts they might have and that report and monitor regulatory compliance.

The number of employees of the main plants of the Group, plus those based at the parent company (Acerinox S.A.), which are covered by some form of agreement, are shown in the following table. It should be noted that in Spain, the collective agreement applicable to the metal industry is applied.

4.5 Training
Professional development is a basic right for the individual and a need for the company. Acerinox believes that the development of its professionals is a priority, given that without adequate training there is neither quality nor innovation, and for that reason it promotes training courses for employees.

Some training courses are compulsory, necessary, and periodical, such as those related to security and prevention of risks. Others are strongly encouraged by the company, including those through systems arising from collective negotiations.

During 2018, the Training Plan was one of the sections of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors, thus reaffirming the company's commitment to this key matter.

4.6 Accessibility
All the Acerinox facilities and workplaces are enabled to facilitate and improve access for employees, customers, suppliers and whoever might need to access them. In addition to the mandatory compliance with the applicable regulations for that purpose, Acerinox facilitates the carrying out of any necessary reforms, studying improvements to its buildings and workplaces.
4.7 Diversity and equal opportunities
At its meeting in December 2018, the Acerinox Board of Directors approved the company's new Diversity Plan in which the principles on this matter and the measures for ensuring equal conditions and defending diversity in the activities of the Group are set forth.
The Acerinox Board of Directors is a true reflection of the international character of the company and the success of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee when it comes to applying diversity guidelines which the Selection of Directors Policy supports.
Starting with gender diversity, currently three of its fifteen members are women. The figure would be even higher if it was not for the recent resignations of two female directors, who have had to submit to the guidelines of their new companies on the matter of compatibility of duties or that have demanded greater dedication due to corporate movements. It must be said previously two other female directors to give up their mandates before the planned time period set due to the same circumstances. The Board of Directors decided to assume a conducive policy that by 2020 at least 30% of the Board members should be women.

204

However, despite gender being an important matter, diversity also extends to other areas. Other forms of diversity must contribute to the process of creating value and that of decision-making at the heart of the organisation and that this should be a melting pot in which a wide range of experience, skills and knowledge merge together and take form.
Four different continents are represented on the Board of Directors thanks to the diverse nationalities of its members. Europe is of course the most represented continent, but we can also find an American, a South African and two Japanese board members.
Three members, plus the non-director Secretary, began their careers in Public Administration or at university before moving to the private sector. Seven of them have a strong industrial nature for having undertaken, or still undertaking various positions both in the metal industry itself, as well as others such as the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, automotive, paper, new technologies and energy industries. Some of them have worked in more than one of these industries. Five of them come from the financial world, including investment banking, savings banks, and the insurance sector.

Non-financial Information record
Since 2016 the largest part of the group is that of the independent directors, made up of eight members, followed by the six proprietary directors, and one executive director. The aim has been to repeat this proportion in the Executive Committee (four independent, one executive, and three proprietary directors). In the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, the distribution is three independent and a proprietary member and the same can be said of the Audit Committee. Both in the Board itself as well as the Committees, the chairperson's position is occupied by an independent director. The Acerinox Group is present in five continents and is made up of people of different cultures, of the most commonly-practised religions in the world and with very diverse beliefs, orientations, and traditions. Diversity is, therefore, a consequence of the international nature of the company. The prevention of sexual and gender harassment in the workplace is regulated in our Code of Conduct, which contains essential statements regarding the prohibition and prevention of harassment of any kind in the workplace. Moreover, Acerinox has enabled a complaints system in the companies which form the group. Any worker who is considered to have been affected has the possibility of requesting precautionary measures to be adopted and these will be implemented automatically while the investigation takes place. The measures to prevent and suppress harassment have been incorporated into the collective agreements through reference to the Code of Conduct. The Group has had no record of any reports of harassment through the normal channels that the company has established for this purpose throughout 2018.

5.1 Due Diligence
The Group provides the necessary complaints channels for any breaches of the Code and other inappropriate behaviour to be made known to the Code of Conduct Monitoring Committee.
These channels, provided by Acerinox, guarantee the confidentiality of the complainant and, if necessary, the Group guarantees its cooperation with the relevant authorities.
5.2 Risk Prevention
Since 2015, the Acerinox Group has had a General Policy for Risk Management and Control, establishing the basic principles and framework for the control and management of risks of any nature that the companies of the Group may face.
The Governance Bodies of the Group have implemented a Risk Management Model to identify, manage, and mitigate risks. The heads of the units draw up a report of any event involving a potential risk to the Company and whose response measures are analysed and assessed by the Director of Corporate Risk Management, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
The current Risk Management Model is based on an event identification methodology applied to all of the business units and, once the risks have been inventoried and analysed they are assessed according to their probability of occurrence and impact.
Currently, the Risk Management Model is evolving to improve the methodology in measuring the risks to complete the expert judgement and allow the definition of tolerance limits accepted by Acerinox to be updated. New metrics and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are being developed which allow the monitoring process to be improved and the monitoring of risks in the entity, by recording the events, causes, and impacts caused. This evolution of Risk Management Model is based on a methodology for assessing the expected loss of each risk by the experts responsible for managing this risk, analysing the probability (frequency) and economic impact (average scenario) of each of the events.
The identified risks are quantified in terms of impact and probability of occurrence in order to allow them to be compared, aggregated, and prioritised. The risk events which have occurred and recorded are compiled in order to calculate the probability of them happening again. Worst-case scenarios as regards their economic impact are also recorded.
5.3 Complaints
Throughout 2018 there have been no complaints or claims of an infringement of human rights in the Group.

5.4 Promotion and Compliance with the Provisions of the Agreements
Ethical behaviour is one of the cornerstones of the Group and is regulated by the Code of Conduct and Best Practices applicable to all professionals in the Company. The principles contained therein also apply to all relationships with third parties who work for them, or on their behalf. 100% of the employees of Acerinox Europa, Columbus Stainless, and Bahru Stainless are covered by collective agreements agreed between the Group and the employees' representatives of each of the plants. The Group supports the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and promotes that explicitly stated: that businesses must support the elimination of all forms of forced labour, child or compulsory labour, and during 2018 the Group has not identified any operations or activities this type.

Acerinox has not made any contributions to sectoral organisations.
6.2 Measures to Combat Money Laundering

The Acerinox Group supports and contributes to the sustainable development of local communities as a valuable contribution to society to maintain a state of well-being in all the countries in which it operates. In order to do this, Acerinox maintains a continuous and two-way dialogue with public bodies and authorities, governments and other local concerned parties, following the guidelines set out in the Code of Conduct and Best Practices of the company.

The payment of salaries, amounts paid in taxes and social security and the indirect activity generated by its plants are one of the leading producers of wealth and a social stabiliser. Each of the companies which make up the Group has its own established communication channels through which it can apply to cooperate with social action programmes. In each of these there are managers for this department whose telephone numbers and email addresses are available in order for them to be able to answer these requests. Following the internal regulations, any request that requires processing must be submitted in writing, specifying the amount of the request, the object for which it is intended, the organisation that has requested it and the channels through which it can be undertaken. In each case, a commission is responsible for assessing all the requests and for the granting of those considered most necessary.
