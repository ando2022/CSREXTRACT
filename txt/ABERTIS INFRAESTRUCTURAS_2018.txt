NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2018
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. ("Abertis" or "the Parent") was incorporated in Barcelona on 24 February 1967 and its registered office is at Paseo de la Castellana, no. 39 (Madrid).
The company object of Abertis is the construction, upkeep and operation (or simply the upkeep and operation) of toll roads under concession arrangements; the management of road concessions in Spain and abroad; the construction of road infrastructure; the operation of service areas; ancillary activities for the construction, upkeep and operation of toll roads and service stations; and any other activity related to transport and communications and/or telecommunications infrastructure for the mobility and transport of people, goods and information, with such authorisation as might be required therefor. It also includes the preparation of studies, reports, designs and contracts, as well as the management and provision of advisory services in relation to the aforementioned activities.
The Parent may carry on its company object, especially its concession activity, directly or indirectly through its ownership interests in other companies, subject, in this respect, to the legal provisions in force at any given time.
Abertis is the head of a group engaging in the management of mobility and communications infrastructure, and currently operates in two sectors: toll road concessions and telecommunications concessions. In this regard, as indicated in Note 7, at 31 December 2018 the Group had, on the one hand, completed the divestment of the terrestrial telecommunications business, through the sale of the ownership interest in Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex) and, on the other, classified as non-current assets held for sale the satellite telecommunications business carried on by the subgroup headed by Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat), which was classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
8

Also, since 29 October 2018 the Parent and the other Group companies have formed part of the Atlantia Group, the parent of which is Atlantia, S.p.A. (with registered office at Via Antonio Nibby, 20, Rome, Italy), which, in turn, belongs to the group headed by Edizione, S.r.l. (with registered office at Piaza del Duomo 19, Treviso, Italy).
The detail of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at 31 December 2018 is shown in Appendices I, II and III, respectively.
Lastly, Note 27-c includes the information on the most significant concession arrangements held by the Group.
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
a) Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2018, which were obtained from the accounting records kept by the Parent and by the other companies composing the Group, were authorised for issue by the Parent's directors at the Board of Directors meeting held on 19 February 2019.
These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group provided for in International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as adopted by the European Union, taking into account all the mandatory accounting principles and rules and measurement bases, and the Spanish Commercial Code, the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, the Spanish Securities Market Law and all other applicable Spanish corporate law, as well as the rules of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), and, accordingly, they present fairly the Abertis Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2018 and the consolidated results of its operations, the changes in consolidated equity and the consolidated cash flows in the year then ended.
9

Since the accounting policies and measurement bases used in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018 may differ from those used by certain Group companies, the required adjustments and reclassifications were made on consolidation to unify the policies and methods used and to make them compliant with IFRSs.
In order to uniformly present the various items composing the consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies and measurement bases adopted by the Parent were applied to all the consolidated companies.
The consolidated and separate financial statements of Abertis and the separate and/or consolidated financial statements of the companies and/or subgroups composing the Group will be submitted to the shareholders or sole shareholder at their respective Annual General Meetings, as applicable, within the legally established time periods. The directors of Abertis consider that the aforementioned financial statements will be approved without any material changes.
The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Parent held on 13 March 2018.
b) Adoption of IFRSs
The Abertis Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with IFRSs, in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002. In Spain, the requirement to present consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as approved by the European Union was also regulated by Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003, of 30 December, on Tax, Administrative, Labour and Social Security Measures.
The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted by Abertis are presented in Note 3.

1 January 2020 1 January 2020

Improvements to IFRSs, 2015-2017 cycle (issued in December 2017)

Minor amendments to a series of 1 January 2019 standards.

(1) The date of first-time application of this standard is being reviewed by the IASB.

As regards these standards, IFRS 16 is expected to have a more significant future impact. In this regard, management assessed the potential impact of applying IFRS 16 in the future and considers that its entry into force will not have a material effect, the findings of the assessment performed being as follows:
· IFRS 16 will come into force in 2019 and will supersede IAS 17 and the current associated interpretations. The main new feature of IFRS 16 is that it introduces a single lessee accounting model in which all leases (with certain limited exceptions) will be recognised in the balance sheet with an impact similar to that of the existing finance leases (depreciation of the right-of-use asset and a finance cost for the amortised cost of the liability will be recognised).

14

Management assessed the total effect that application of IFRS 16 will have on the consolidated financial statements. In this regard, based on a preliminary review of the current leases with a value exceeding EUR 150 thousand, and assuming an average lease term of ten years (or longer if the lease term is longer), the associated financial liability at the date of first-time application (1 January 2019) would be approximately EUR 90 million (recognition of a liability with a balancing entry in assets), generating in the future an additional depreciation charge of approximately EUR 14 million and a finance cost of approximately EUR 3 million, which would offset the decrease of approximately EUR 15 million per year in the operating lease expenses recognised in accordance with the current IAS 17.
The aforementioned assessment, as indicated above, was performed on the basis of an analysis of current leases with a value exceeding EUR 150 thousand, taking into account the present facts and circumstances. Since these facts and circumstances may change in the period up to the date of initial application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, and since the Group has not applied the standard early, the assessment of its potential effect is subject to change. At the reporting date, the Group intends to apply IFRS 16 retrospectively, without restating the comparative information.
c) Presentation and functional currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in the Group's functional currency, the euro, since this is the currency of the main economic area in which the Group operates. In this connection, the financial statements of the foreign companies presented in a functional currency other than the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are translated to euros using the method described in Note 2-g.vi.
15

d) Responsibility for the information and use of accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, management was required to make certain accounting estimates and to consider certain factors on which to make judgements. These estimates and judgements, which are assessed on an ongoing basis, are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations regarding future events that are considered to be reasonable in view of the circumstances. Although the estimates used were based on the best information available at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IAS 8, any change in estimates in the future would be applied prospectively from that time, and the effect of the change in the estimates would be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the period in question.
The principal estimates and judgements made in preparing the consolidated financial statements related to:
· The years of useful life of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (see Notes 3-a and 3-b).
· The assumptions used in the impairment test to determine the recoverable amount of the goodwill, intangible assets and other nonfinancial assets (see Notes 3-c, 8, 9 and 10).
· The business model vis-à-vis the Group's financial assets and the consequent classification thereof (see Note 3-d).
· The estimate of the recoverable amount of the quoted and unquoted financial assets and the financial assets relating to the concession arrangements held by the Group, in particular the balance relating to RD 457/2006 (see Notes 3-d and 13).
· The significant increase in credit risk which led to a change from the general 12-month expected credit loss to a lifetime expected credit loss model (see Notes 3-d and 13).
· The fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments (see Notes 3-d, 3-e and 12).
· The estimate of the maintenance cycles in determining the provisions recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12 (see Notes 3-n and 21).
· The assessment of litigation, provisions, obligations and contingent assets and liabilities at year-end (see Notes 21 and 23).
16

· The assumptions used in determining pension and other obligations to employees (see Notes 3-l and 20).
· The estimate of the income tax expense and the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets (see Notes 3-k and 19).
· The fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in business combinations (if any), and of non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (see Notes 3-h and 7).
· The impact of the changes in the scope of consolidation of the Group, if any (see Note 5).
The consolidated financial statements were prepared on an historical cost basis, except in the cases specifically indicated in these Notes, such as the line items measured at fair value described in Notes 3-d.i and 4-b.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the principle of uniformity in recognition and measurement. If a new standard amending existing measurement bases becomes applicable, it will be applied in accordance with the transition guidance provided in that standard.
Certain amounts in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated balance sheet were grouped together for the sake of clarity, and they are broken down in the corresponding notes to these consolidated financial statements. In this connection, the Group presented different levels of aggregation and disaggregation in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements (balance sheet and statement of profit or loss) for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. This change is part of the change in the Parent's shareholders that took place in 2018 (see Note 15) and was made in order to provide more homogeneous information for users of financial statements in the context of the integration thereof in a higher group.
The distinction presented in the consolidated balance sheet between current and non-current items was made on the basis of whether the assets and liabilities are to be realised or settled within one year or more.
In addition, the consolidated financial statements include all disclosures considered necessary for their correct presentation in accordance with the corporate legislation in force in Spain.
17

Lastly, the figures included in all the consolidated financial statements (consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows) and the notes to the consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of euros, unless it is explicitly stated that they are expressed in millions of euros.
e) Comparative information As required under IFRSs, the information relating to the year ended 31 December 2017 contained in these consolidated financial statements for 2018 is presented solely for comparison purposes. In this connection, in 2018 the Group made changes in the certain criteria used in the presentation of its financial statements and, consequently, adapted the comparative information pursuant to IAS 1, as indicated in Note 5-b.
f) Materiality In determining the information to disclose in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the various line items in the consolidated financial statements or on other matters, the Group took into consideration materiality with respect to these consolidated financial statements for 2018.
18

g) Basis of consolidation
i) Consolidation methods
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are the entities with respect to which Abertis directly or indirectly controls the financial and operating policies, exercises power over the relevant activities, has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of those returns. This is generally because it holds more than 50% of the voting power. Also, in order to assess whether Abertis controls another entity, the existence and the effect of the exercise or conversion of potential voting power is taken into consideration. The subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Abertis and are excluded from consolidation on the date that control ceases to exist. The subsidiaries are fully consolidated. In this connection, at 31 December 2018 and 2017 the Group fully consolidated Grupo Concesionario del Oeste, S.A. (Gco) and Autopistas del Sol, S.A. (Ausol) over which it exercises effective control despite directly holding 50% or less of the dividend and political rights. Specifically, both in case of Gco and Ausol, effective control is exercised as a result of the structure, composition of the shareholding and historical quorum, that gives Abertis to hold de facto control, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.
19

Abertis exercises effective control over the subgroup of which the consolidated company Arteris, S.A. (Arteris) is the parent, since Abertis exercises effective control over the consolidated company Partícipes en Brasil, S.A. (Partícipes, which holds a direct and indirect interest of 82.30% in Arteris, S.A.) as it holds a 51% ownership interest in the latter, and by virtue of the shareholders agreement entered into with the other shareholder of the company, giving it decision-making capacity over relevant activities. Partícipes, as majority shareholder, has the capacity to appoint a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Arteris and, consequently, exercises control over the latter.
Also, Abertis exercises effective control over Túnels de Barcelona i Cadí, Concesionària de la Generalitat de Catalunya, S.A. (Túnels) and Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico, LLC (Metropistas), as it holds ownership interests of over 50%, specifically 50.01% and 51%, respectively, and by virtue of the respective shareholders agreements entered into with the other shareholder of each company, which gives Abertis decision-making capacity over the investees' relevant activities.
The information on all the consolidated subsidiaries at 31 December 2018 is detailed in Appendix I to these Notes.
Joint ventures (jointly controlled entities)
These are companies whose activities are jointly controlled with one or more third parties by virtue of a contractual arrangement and where the strategic financial and operating decisions related to that activity require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control.
The Group's interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 11 using the equity method as indicated in the section on "Associates" below.
The impairment of "Joint Ventures" is measured in the same way as that of "Associates" as described below.
Appendix II to these Notes provides the information on joint ventures (jointly controlled entities) accounted for using the equity method at 31 December 2017.
20

Associates
An associate is a company over which Abertis exercises significant influence and with which it has a long-term relationship that fosters and influences its activities even though it has limited representation in the management and control bodies which, in general, is accompanied by an ownership interest of between 20% and 50% of the voting power of the investee, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such influence does not exist or unless Abertis holds less than 20% of that power and it can be clearly demonstrated that said influence does exist.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. Abertis's investments in associates include, in accordance with IAS 28, any goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment losses) identified on acquisition, recognised under "Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures" in the consolidated balance sheet.
In the case of associates acquired in stages, IAS 28 does not specifically define how to determine the related cost. Therefore, the Group takes the cost of an investment in an associate acquired in stages to be the sum of the amounts paid in each acquisition plus the share of the profits and other changes in equity less any impairment that may have arisen.
Following acquisition, Abertis's share of the profit or loss and reserves of associates is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year and as reserves of consolidated companies (other comprehensive income), respectively, with the value of the ownership interest as the balancing item in both cases. Dividends received and/or accrued after acquisition are adjusted against the amount of the investment.
If the Group's share of the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any receivables for which adequate collateral does not exist, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses, unless it has incurred obligations, provided guarantees or made payments on behalf of the associate.
21

If there are any indications of impairment, the investment will be tested for impairment, pursuant to IAS 36, as if it were an individual asset, by comparing its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. In order to determine the value in use of the net investment, an estimate will be made of: i) its share of the present value, discounted at a rate of the weighted average cost of capital, of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the associate or joint venture, including those from the operations of the associate or joint venture, and the amounts arising from the ultimate disposal of the investment; or ii) the present value, discounted at a rate corresponding to the cost of equity, of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise as dividends to be received from the investment and from its ultimate disposal. The application of either method should produce the same result.
The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or joint venture will be assessed for each associate or joint venture unless the associate or joint venture does not generate cash inflows as a result of its continuing use that are largely independent of the inflows from the Group's other assets.
The data relating to the associates accounted for using the equity method at 31 December 2018 are detailed in Appendix III to these Notes.
ii) Uniformity of timing and measurement
Except in the case of TTPL and JEPL, whose annual reporting periods end on 31 March, the reporting date for all the companies included in the scope of consolidation is 31 December, and their respective financial statements for the year prepared in accordance with IFRSs were used for consolidation purposes. Under current legislation, these companies present either separate financial statements or consolidated financial statements for the subgroups of which they are the parents in accordance with the legislation applicable to them in their country of origin.
For consolidation purposes, in the specific case of Trichy Tollway Private Limited (TTPL) and Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL), timing uniformity adjustments were made, and the respective financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs for a year ended 31 December were used.
22

The accounting policies applied by the Group companies are essentially the same. However, wherever necessary, in order to ensure the uniformity of the accounting policies of the consolidated companies with the accounting policies applied by the Group, the appropriate adjustments were made.
iii) Goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase arising on first-time consolidation
The subsidiaries acquired by the Group are accounted for using the acquisition method provided for in IFRS 3. Acquisition cost is the fair value of the assets acquired, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date, plus any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which the transaction takes place.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially recognised at their acquisition-date fair value, including those attributable to non-controlling interests. For each business combination, the Group may choose to recognise any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at either fair value or the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets identified in the transaction is recognised as goodwill arising on consolidation, which is allocated to the respective cash-generating unit (CGU).
Abertis carries out a provisional allocation of the cost of the business combination at the acquisition date which is remeasured, if appropriate, within the 12 months following the date on which control of the acquiree was obtained.
The resulting goodwill is allocated to the various CGUs to which the benefits of the business combination synergies are expected to flow, separately from any other assets or liabilities of the acquiree allocated to these units or groups of units.
However, if the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised as a gain directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
23

Goodwill on consolidation is not amortised systematically but is rather tested for impairment annually, as indicated in Note 3-c.
In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, on obtainment of control the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the business acquired must be determined including the interest already held. The differences arising from the previously recognised assets and liabilities must be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
In the case of associates acquired in stages, goodwill is calculated for each acquisition based on the cost and the share of the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.
As indicated in Note 2-g.i, goodwill arising from acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is capitalised to the corresponding ownership interest and is measured as indicated in Note 3-b.iii.
iv) Elimination of intra-Group transactions
Intra-Group balances and transactions and gains not realised vis-à-vis third parties arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction evidences an impairment loss on the asset transferred.
Gains and losses arising from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are recognised in the Group's financial statements only to the extent that they arise from the interests of other investors in associates and joint ventures not related to the investor.
v) Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recognised as transactions with the Group's equity holders. Accordingly, in purchases of non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the proportionate share of the carrying amount of the net assets of the subsidiary is taken to equity. Similarly, gains or losses on disposals of noncontrolling interests are also recognised in the Group's equity.
24

If the Group ceases to exercise significant influence or control, the investment retained is remeasured at its fair value and any gain or loss relative to the previously recognised investment is taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. In addition, any amount previously recognised as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to this entity is accounted for as if the Group had directly sold all the related assets and liabilities, which would give rise, where applicable, to the amounts previously recognised under "Other Comprehensive Income" being reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. If the decrease in the investment in an associate does not give rise to a loss of significant influence, the proportional share previously recognised in "Other Comprehensive Income" is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
vi) Translation of financial statements in currencies other than the euro
The financial statements of the foreign companies presented in a functional currency (that of the main economic area in which the entity operates) other than the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements (the euro) are generally translated to euros using the year-end exchange rate method, whereby:
· Equity is translated at the historical exchange rate; · Income and expense items are translated using the average
exchange rate for the year as an approximation to the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date; · The other balance sheet items are translated using the year-end exchange rate.
The exchange differences generated as a result of applying the aforementioned method are included under "Reserves - Translation Differences" in equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
25

Translation of financial statements in currencies other than the euro entities and branches located in hyperinflationary economies
In accordance with IAS 29, in order to assess whether an economy is a hyperinflationary economy, the characteristics of the economic environment of a country are analysed to assess whether certain circumstances exist, such as whether the general population prefers to keep its wealth or savings in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency, whether prices may be quoted in that currency, whether interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index or whether the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%. The existence of certain of these circumstances does not in itself establish the need for an economy to be considered to be hyperinflationary, although it does provide certain elements of judgment for its determination as such.
In this regard, on the basis of these criteria, in the third quarter of 2018 the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary. Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned IAS 29, at 31 December 2018 it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of the Group companies located in Argentina (Ausol and Gco) in order to express them in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period and adjust them for the effects of inflation.
As required by IAS 29, monetary items (mainly cash and accounts receivable) were not restated, whereas non-monetary items (mainly noncurrent assets and equity) were restated on the basis of the change in the Argentine CPI.
Cumulative historical differences between the restated cost and the previous cost of non-monetary items at 31 December 2017, totalling EUR 161 million (EUR 57 million relating to Abertis and EUR 104 million corresponding to non-controlling interests), were recognised with a credit to "Translation Differences" and "Non-Controlling Interests" in consolidated equity effective for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018, while the differences corresponding to the year ended 31 December 2018, together with the restated profit or loss, were recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2018.
Therefore, as stated above, the financial statements of the Argentine consolidated Group companies, whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy as indicated above, were translated to the presentation currency using the closing rate, as required by IAS 21 p.42.
26

vii) Other
Exchange differences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign operation and of loans and other instruments in a currency other than the euro designated as hedges of those investments are recognised in equity. When the investment is sold, those exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a component of the gain or loss on the sale.
Adjustments to goodwill and the fair value of assets and liabilities that arise on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the year-end exchange rate.
h) Changes in the scope of consolidation
i) Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2018
In the year ended 31 December 2018 there were no significant changes in the scope of consolidation. The detail of the most significant changes in the percentages of ownership of consolidated companies is as follows:
· As indicated in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, on 16 January 2018 the acquisition from the Provincia di Verona and Provincia di Vicenza Governments of 6.47% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) for EUR 33 million was completed. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis now holds 90.03% of A4 (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Internacional, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 28 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent (see Note 15-d.i).
· As indicated in Note 20.ii to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, at 31 December 2017 the Group had recognised two commitments to purchase shares of JEPL and Hispasat from third-party shareholders for EUR 14 million (for 26% of the shares of JEPL) and EUR 302 million (for 33.69% of the shares of Hispasat), respectively, which were honoured in the first half of 2018. Thus:
27

o On 27 March 2018, the acquisition from the funds Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte. Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust of 26% of the share capital of JEPL for EUR 15 million was completed. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis now holds 100% of JEPL (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Internacional, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this company did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 8 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent (see Note 15-d.ii).
o The acquisition from Eutelsat, S.A. of 32.63% (lower than the 33.69% indicated as a result of the exercise of the right of proration of thirdparty shareholders of Hispasat) of the share capital of Hispasat for EUR 293 million was completed on 18 April 2018. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis now holds 89.68% of Hispasat (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Telecom Satélites, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 378 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent (see Note 15-d.iii) and, in relation to the percentage of ownership not acquired over which Eutelsat, S.A. had been granted a put option (see Note 21), in accordance with IAS 23.32 since it expired without being exercised a positive impact of EUR 9 million was recognised in the Group's equity (see Note 15-c).
· In 2018, as described in Note 7.ii, the Group completed the sale of the entire ownership interest that it held in Cellnex at 31 December 2017 (34% of its share capital).

It should also be noted that in relation to the consolidated company Gco, on 8 November 2018 the Group, as required by the Argentine National Securities Market Commission, set up a trust for the future sale of 5.73% of the investment in that company, establishing in the agreement, among other aspects, the assignment to the trustee of the voting and dividend rights associated with the ownership interest assigned.
In this regard, on 27 November 2018, after receiving the required authorisation from the National Highway Administration of Argentina (Dirección Nacional de Vialidad de Argentina), the Group subsidiary Acesa sold 9,160,136 of its Class A shares, representing 5.73% of its dividend rights and 7.58% of its voting rights, to TMF Trust Company (Argentina), S.A. ("TMF"). From a legal standpoint, the voting and dividend rights corresponding to the shares were transferred irrevocably to TMF and, accordingly, Acesa's voting rights at Gco were reduced from the 57.7% it held to 49.99%. TMF is an independent international nominee shareholder that belongs to the TMF Group and, as such, will be responsible for transferring the aforementioned shares of Gco to one or several possible interested third parties.

30

From an accounting standpoint, and in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group, on the one hand, the current position of control was reassessed, pursuant to IFRS 10, and it was concluded that de facto control is still held and, on the other, taking into account the terms of the agreement, the transfer was not considered to be a derecognition for accounting purposes since economic risks relating to the price of the shares were retained.
ii) Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2017
The detail of the most significant changes in the scope of consolidation of the Group and of the changes in the percentages of ownership of consolidated companies in 2017 is as follows:
· In 2017 Abertis, through various purchase transactions, completed the acquisition of an additional 47.45% of the share capital of Holding d'Infraestructures de Transport (Hit, a company that controls 100% of Sanef) for a total of EUR 2,214 million. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis now directly owns all the shares of Hit. In this regard, the various purchase transactions carried out were recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a negative impact of EUR 1,275 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent.
The detail of the various purchase transactions carried out is as follows:
o The acquisition from Caisse des Dépots et Consignations (CDC) of 10.52% of the share capital of Hit for EUR 491 million was completed on 20 February 2017. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis now directly owned 63.07% of the shares of Hit.
o The acquisition from Axa République (AXA) of 9.65% of the share capital of Hit for EUR 451 million was completed on 27 March 2017. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis now directly owned 72.72% of the shares of Hit.
o The acquisition from Predica, FFP Invest and CNP Assurances of 17.08%, 5.10% and 5.10% of the share capital of Hit for EUR 796 million, EUR 238 million and EUR 238 million, respectively, was completed on 28 April 2017. As a result of the acquisition of these additional ownership interests, Abertis now directly owns all the shares of Hit.
31

· Also in 2017 Abertis, by means of various purchase transactions, completed the acquisition of an additional 32.16% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) for EUR 179 million. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis now holds 83.56% of A4 (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Internacional, S.A.). In this regard, the various purchase transactions carried out were recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 122 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent. The detail of the various purchase transactions carried out is as follows: o The acquisition from the Gavio Group and the Mantovani Group of 7.58% of the share capital of A4 for EUR 42 million was completed in March 2017. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis indirectly owned 58.98% of the shares of A4. o The acquisition from the Gavio Group, Banco Populare and the Bergamo local authorities of 7.79% of the share capital of A4 for EUR 43 million was completed in June 2017. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis indirectly owned 66.77% of the shares of A4. o The acquisition from Unione Fiduciaria S.p.A. (Serravalle) and the Brescia, Verona, Vicenza and Venezia local authorities of 16.79% of the share capital of A4 for EUR 93 million was completed in July 2017. As a result of the acquisition of this additional ownership interest, Abertis indirectly now owned 83.56% of the shares of A4. o In addition, there were commitments to purchase an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4 which, once fulfilled in January 2018 (as described above), have enabled Abertis to acquire an indirect ownership interest of 90.03% in this company.
32

· On 2 March 2017, Abertis (acting through its wholly-owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis India, S.L.U., Abertis India) completed the acquisition of all the shares of the Indian company Trichy Tollway Private Limited (TTPL,concession operator of the NH-45 toll road in the state of Tamil Nadu) and of 74% of the shares of the Indian company Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL, concession operator of the NH-44 toll road in the state of Telangana) from the funds MSIIPL and SMIT (controlled by Macquarie and the State Bank of India, respectively) for an aggregate amount of EUR 133 million. This acquisition was effective for accounting purposes from 1 March 2017 and both TTPL and JEPL were both fully consolidated.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (EU-IFRSs) and the interpretations in force when the consolidated financial statements were prepared, were as follows:

35

a) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less the accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Property, plant and equipment includes the revaluations made in years prior to 1 January 2004 permitted under local legislation, and, pursuant to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the revalued amounts were taken to be the acquisition cost of the related assets.
Grants related to assets received reduce the cost of acquisition of property, plant and equipment and are recognised when the entity complies with the conditions attaching to their collection. They are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed, reducing the depreciation charge for the year.
Staff costs and other expenses, as well as net borrowing costs directly attributable to property, plant and equipment, are capitalised as part of the acquisition cost until the assets are ready for their intended use.
The costs of renewal, expansion or improvement of items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised to the asset only when this leads to increased capacity or productivity or to a lengthening of the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and provided that it is possible to ascertain or estimate the carrying amount of the items that are derecognised because they have been replaced.
Upkeep and maintenance costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they are incurred.
The investment in infrastructure recognised by concession operators in "Property, Plant and Equipment" relates to assets over which the concession grantor does not retain control (i.e., assets not owned by the concession grantor given that it does not control any residual interest at the end of the term of the arrangement), but which are necessary for the operation and management of the infrastructure. This infrastructure includes mainly buildings used in operations, toll facilities and materials and videosurveillance equipment, etc.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated systematically using the straight-line method over the useful life of the assets, based on the actual decline in value caused by their use and wear and tear.
36

The depreciation rates used to calculate the depreciation of the various items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Item
Buildings and other structures Machinery Tools Other fixtures Furniture Computer hardware Other items of property, plant and equipment Other toll road management assets:
Toll facilities Toll machinery Other

Depreciation rate
2-15 % 6-30 % 7-30 % 7-20 % 10-20 % 20-33 % 8-25 %
8-12 % 8-12 % 10-20 %

When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, its carrying amount is reduced immediately to its recoverable amount, and the impact is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Gains and losses arising from the sale or retirement of assets of this nature are determined as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its selling price and are recognised under "Other Income" or "Other Expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss.

b) Goodwill and other intangible assets
The intangible assets indicated below are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, and their useful life is evaluated on the basis of prudent estimates. Grants related to assets received reduce the cost of acquisition of intangible assets and are recognised when the entity complies with the conditions attaching to their collection. They are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed and reduce the amortisation charge for the year.
The carrying amount of intangible assets is reviewed for possible impairment when certain events or changes indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.

37

i) Computer software
Computer software relates mainly to the amounts paid for title to or the right to use computer programs, only when the software is expected to be used over several years.
It is stated at acquisition cost and is amortised over its useful life (between three and five years). Computer software maintenance costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they are incurred.
ii) Administrative concessions
"Administrative Concessions" in the consolidated balance sheet includes mainly concession arrangements for the construction and operation of various toll road networks, within the scope of IFRIC 12, as well as concessions acquired directly or as part of a business combination.
In this connection, IFRIC 12 governs the treatment of public-to-private service concession arrangements when:
· the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and
· the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.
In general, a distinction must be drawn between two clearly different phases: the first, in which the operator provides and/or subcontracts construction or upgrade services which are recognised as intangible or financial assets by reference to the stage of completion; and a second phase, in which the concession operator provides a series of maintenance and/or operation services in relation to the aforementioned infrastructure.
In these concession arrangements, the operator acts as a service provider; specifically, on the one hand, providing infrastructure construction and upgrade services and, on the other, providing operation and maintenance services over the term of the arrangement. The consideration received for these services is recognised according to the type of contractual right received:
38

· When the right to charge a price to the users of the public service is received and this right is not unconditional but is rather contingent on the extent to which the users actually use the service, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as an intangible asset under "Other Intangible Assets - Administrative Concessions", using the intangible asset model, in which the demand risk is borne by the concession operator. This model applies to the great majority of the Group's toll road concession operators.
· When an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from (or on behalf of) the grantor is received, and the grantor has little or no discretion to avoid payment, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as a financial asset under "Other financial assets ­ Concession arrangements ­ financial asset model" (see Section d.ii of this Note), using the financial asset model, in which the concession operator does not bear any demand risk (it is paid even if the infrastructure is not used, given that the grantor guarantees the concession operator that it will pay a fixed or determinable amount or cover any shortfall). This model is not extensively applied within the Group.
· When there is a combination of the two aforementioned arrangements, the bifurcated model is applied to each component of the arrangement.
The model applicable to most of the main concessions operated by the Group (see Note 27-c) is the intangible asset model, since the consideration received generally consists of the right to charge users a fee for the use of the public service, and the fee depends on users' effective use thereof. In the case of the consolidated companies Elqui, Libertadores and A4 (the latter as a result of the investments made indicated in Nota 9-v), it was considered that the concession model applicable is that of both a financial asset and an intangible asset (bifurcated), since the consideration received consists, on the one hand, of the unconditional right to receive an asset from the grantor in the form of either grants or guaranteed minimum revenue, and, on the other, through a payment system based on the use of the infrastructure.
39

Intangible asset model
Administrative concessions are generally recognised as assets measured at the total amount of the payments made to obtain them, which includes the costs directly allocable to construction incurred until they are ready for use (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services, project execution, project management and administration expenses, installation work and building construction and similar costs) and the related portion of other indirectly allocable costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction phase.
Cost also includes the borrowing costs incurred before the assets are ready for their intended use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects. These capitalised borrowing costs arise from the funds borrowed specifically for the acquisition of an asset.
For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and restoration and any work to upgrade the infrastructure or increase its capacity the revenue from which is provided for in the initial contract are capitalised at the start of the concession and the amortisation of these assets and the interest cost relating to the provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also, provisions for the costs to be incurred in replacing and repairing the infrastructure are systematically recognised in profit or loss as the corresponding obligation is incurred.
Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the assets or an increase in their production capacity are expensed currently.
Administrative concessions acquired through business combinations after 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRSs) are measured, in accordance with IFRS 3, at fair value (obtained from valuations based on the analysis of cash flows discounted to present value at the date of acquisition) and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the concession term.
40

Administrative concessions have a finite useful life and their cost, if recognised as an intangible asset, is recognised in profit or loss through its amortisation over the concession term. In this regard, in order to choose the amortisation method to be used from among those provided for in IAS 38.98 (the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method), the directors consider which method best reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits associated with the administrative concessions are expected to be consumed by the Group, and that method is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.
In this connection, since 1 November 2018, in the framework of the obtainment of control of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by new shareholders (see Note 15-a), the new directors have considered, on the basis of the available information and the future outlook for the business, that the method that best reflects the pattern of consumption of future economic benefits for the administrative concessions in Brazil, Chile and India is the units of production method which, in the case of toll roads, is usually measured in terms of traffic. Therefore, since that date, the aforementioned administrative concessions have been amortised, prospectively, on the basis of projected traffic, while the straight-line method continues to be used for the rest of the Group's assets, since it is not differing significantly from the production units method based on traffic.
Lastly, at least at each reporting date, it is periodically determined whether there is any indication that an asset or group of assets might have become impaired so that an impairment loss can be recognised or reversed in order to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their recoverable amount.
iii) Goodwill
Goodwill generated in various business combinations represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the acquisition-date fair or market value of all the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
41

Since goodwill is considered to be an asset of the acquiree (with the exception of goodwill generated before 1 January 2004 which, pursuant to IFRS 1, was considered an asset of the acquirer), in the case of a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the euro, goodwill is stated in the subsidiary's functional currency and is translated to euros using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, as indicated in Note 2-g.vii.
Any impairment of goodwill recognised separately (that of subsidiaries) is reviewed annually through an impairment test to determine whether its value has been reduced to below its carrying amount at the date of the test and, if so, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year (see Notes 3-c and 8). An impairment loss recognised for goodwill must not be reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill included in the carrying amount of investments in associates and interests in jointly controlled entities is not tested for impairment separately, but rather, pursuant to IAS 36, whenever there is an indication that the investment may have become impaired, the total carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount.
The loss or gain on the sale of an entity includes the carrying amount of the goodwill relating to it.
iv) Other intangible assets
The other intangible assets relate mainly to those associated with managing satellite telecommunications infrastructure that arose as a result of the obtainment of control over Hispasat in November 2013. These intangible assets relate to the use of current orbital positions owned by Hispasat and to business relationships with customers, which at 2018 year-end (as at 2017 year-end) are classified under "Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 7).
42

The aforementioned intangible assets are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at their acquisition-date fair value, obtained from valuations based on the analysis of cash flows discounted to present value at the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3.
Based on an analysis of all relevant factors, it is estimated that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the orbital positions are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group (despite the fact that they are granted through an administrative license), since they are renewed through a mere administrative procedure; accordingly, these assets have been assessed as having an indefinite useful life and, therefore, they are not amortised, but rather are tested annually for impairment. It has been estimated, however, that there is a foreseeable limit to the period over which the customer relationships generate net cash inflows and, consequently, these relationships have been assessed as having a finite useful life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over a useful life of ten years.
Lastly, with regard to the use of the orbital positions, the business activities in the various geographical areas and orbital positions are considered to constitute an integrated business, given the possibility of relocating satellites and customers among the various satellites as a result of their nature and the fact that the Hispasat subgroup's satellites allow for operations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
c) Impairment losses on non-financial assets
At each reporting date, or whenever there is any indication of impairment, the Group assesses the recoverable amount of its assets. If any such indication exists, or when an annual impairment test has to be performed (in the case of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. In assessing the recoverable amount of an asset, the estimated future cash inflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects, inter alia, the long-term time value of money and the risks specific to the asset and, where applicable, any costs of disposal.
43

Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from those of other assets (the case of goodwill), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets) to which the asset belongs. If a cash-generating unit becomes impaired, the carrying amount of any goodwill assigned to it is written down first, followed by that of the other assets in proportion to each asset's carrying amount with respect to the total carrying amount of the cash-generating unit. Impairment losses (carrying amount of the asset higher than its recoverable amount) are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. With the exception of goodwill, the impairment losses on which are irreversible, at each reporting date, if the Group has recognised impairment losses on assets in prior years, it is assessed whether there are indications that such losses have ceased to exist or have been reduced, and, where appropriate, the recoverable amount of the impaired asset is estimated. An impairment loss recognised in prior years is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of an asset since the most recent impairment loss was recognised. If an impairment loss is reversed, the carrying amount of the related asset is increased to its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
44

d) Financial assets (excluding derivative financial instruments)
When initially recognising financial assets, the Group measures them at fair value, adjusted (in the case of a financial asset that is not recognised at fair value through profit or loss) by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase or issue thereof. Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition of an asset classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised directly in profit or loss.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value, depending on their classification.
1. Classification and measurement of financial assets
Financial assets are classified on initial recognition in the following categories:
i) Debt instruments classified as at amortised cost: when these instruments relate to debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, they are, in general, measured at amortised cost.
ii) Debt instruments classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income: when these debt instruments are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows (payments of principal and interest) and selling financial assets, they are, in general, measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
iii) Equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income: these are equity instruments for which the Group makes an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.
iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: debt and equity instruments that do not meet the conditions for being classified in one or other of the aforementioned categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
45

In this regard, at 31 December 2018 the Group did not have any debt instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

i)

Debt instruments classified as at amortised cost

These include both loans and receivables (see Note 13) and other financial assets (see Notes 11 and 13) held within this business model and, therefore, they are measured at amortised cost. In this category the Group classifies mainly:

· Accounts receivable resulting from the application of the bifurcated model when accounting for certain concession arrangements falling within the scope of IFRIC 12.
· Trade receivables, the amortised cost of which does not differ significantly from their nominal value or their fair value on initial recognition.
· Loans to associates, joint ventures and related companies.
· Deposits and guarantees, the amortised cost of which does not differ significantly from their nominal value.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is its amortised cost, before adjusting for any loss allowance.

46

The effective interest method is a method that is used in the calculation of the amortised cost of a debt instrument and in the allocation of the interest revenue or interest expense in profit or loss over the relevant period:
· Financial assets that are not purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets (i.e., assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition): the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts (including all transaction costs), excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument or, where applicable, a shorter period.
· Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets: the credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including any expected credit losses, to the cost of the debt instrument on initial recognition.
Interest revenue is calculated by using the effective interest method for debt instruments subsequently measured at amortised cost:
· Financial assets that are not purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets: interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, except in the case of those that subsequently have become credit-impaired financial assets. For those financial assets, interest revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves to that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.
· Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets: the Group recognises interest revenue by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The calculation does not return to the gross carrying amount even if the credit risk on the financial asset subsequently improves to that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired.
47

ii) Equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income
These include the equity instruments detailed in Note 11 as the Group has made this irrevocable election.
As indicated above, at initial recognition the Group can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Such designation is not permitted if the investment is held for trading or corresponds to contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. In this regard, a financial asset is held for trading if: i) it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; ii) it is, on initial recognition, part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or iii) it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument).
Investments in equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair value plus the related transaction costs. In this regard, fair value is determined as described in Note 12.
They are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal, but is rather transferred to accumulated reserves.
Dividends on these equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payment of the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
48

2. Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments measured at amortised cost or, if it has any, on investments in debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and on lease receivables, trade receivables, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts.
The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial instrument in question.
The Group always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables. Expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted where necessary by factors that are specific to the borrower, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including the time value of money where appropriate.
For all other financial instruments, including financial assets arising from the application of the IFRIC 12 financial asset model, the Group recognises the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument using the general criterion, i.e., recognition of the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

i)

Significant increase in credit risk

When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on a financial instrument since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. When making such an assessment, the Group considers reasonable and supportable quantitative and qualitative information, including historical credit loss experience.

49

ii) Definition of default The Group considers, among other factors, whether the debtor has defaulted on its financial obligations and whether the available information indicates that it is probable that the latter will not be able to settle its borrowings in full, in order to assess whether there has been a default event for credit risk management purposes. In any case, the Group considers that a default event has occurred when a financial asset has been a significant period of time past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate on the basis of the asset analysed.
iii) Credit-impaired financial assets A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred.
iv) Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses Expected credit losses are measured on the basis of the probability of default, the loss given default and exposure at default. The probability of default and the loss given default are measured on the basis of historical information adjusted by forward-looking information. Exposure to credit losses, for financial assets, is represented by the gross carrying amount of the assets at the reporting date. For financial assets, an expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
50

If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for this lifetime expected credit loss measurement are no longer met, it estimates the expected credit loss at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses at the current reporting date, except for assets for which the simplified approach was used.
The Group recognises impairment gains or losses on all financial instruments with the concomitant adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance for expected credit losses account.
v) Impairment policy
The Group derecognises a financial asset when it has information that indicates that the debtor is in a highly adverse financial situation and there is no reasonable prospect of recovering any further cash flows, for example, when the debtor has initiated a liquidation process or, in the case of trade receivables, when they have been past due for a very significant length of time. Financial assets derecognised may still be subject to the Group's recovery operations. Any recovery of a derecognised asset is recognised in profit or loss.
3. Exchange gains and losses on financial assets
The carrying amount of financial assets denominated in foreign currency (with respect to each Group company that owns such assets) is determined in that foreign currency and is translated to euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Specifically:
· In the case of financial assets measured at amortised cost that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
· In the case of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the investment revaluation reserve.
51

4. Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have also been transferred. However, the Group does not derecognise financial assets, and recognises a financial liability for an amount equal to the consideration received, in transfers of financial assets in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained.
e) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its financial risk arising mainly from fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (see Note 4). These derivative financial instruments, whether classified as hedges or not, were recognised either at fair value, which is the market value at the reporting date for quoted instruments, or using valuations based on an analysis of discounted cash flows using assumptions based mainly on the market conditions at the reporting date for unquoted derivative instruments.
All derivative financial instruments must be recognised as an asset or as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value must be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year, unless, opting for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the hedging relationship has to be recognised in equity (fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a currency other than the euro).
At the inception of the hedge, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and the strategy for undertaking various hedges. The Group also documents how it will assess, both initially and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in the hedges are highly effective for offsetting changes in fair value or in the cash flows attributable to the hedged items.
52

The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes is disclosed in Note 12, and the change in the related valuation adjustments recognised in consolidated equity is disclosed in Note 15. Hedge accounting, where applicable, is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss. Classification of financial instruments as current or non-current in the consolidated balance sheet depends on whether at year-end the hedging relationship expires at less than or more than one year. The criteria used to account for these instruments are as follows:
i) Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of designated derivatives that meet the conditions to be classified as fair value hedges of assets or liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year under "Changes in Fair Value of Financial Instruments", together with any change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk. These relate primarily to the derivative financial instruments arranged by the Group companies to convert fixed-rate borrowings into floating-rate borrowings.
53

ii) Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the measurement of derivatives classified as cash flow hedges, net of the related tax effect, is recognised in consolidated equity under "Reserves - Valuation Adjustments Relating to Hedges" until the hedged item affects profit or loss (or when the underlying matures or is sold or it is no longer probable that the transaction will take place), at which point the accumulated gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of derivatives is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year under "Changes in Fair Value of Financial Instruments".
These hedges relate mainly to derivative financial instruments arranged by Group companies to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.
iii) Hedge of a net investment in a currency other than the euro
In certain cases, Abertis finances its activities in the same functional currency as that in which its foreign investments are held so as to reduce the foreign currency risk. This is done by obtaining financing in the corresponding currency or by entering into cross currency interest rate swaps.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity, while the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Accumulated gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on disposal of the foreign investment.
54

iv) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
v) Fair value and fair valuation measurement techniques
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
For financial reporting purposes, the fair value measurements are classified into Level 1, 2 or 3 depending on the degree to which the inputs used are observable and their importance for measuring fair value in its entirety, as described below:
· Level 1 - These inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments traded in active markets.
· Level 2 - These inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (not included in Level 1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and techniques based on valuation models for which all the significant inputs are observable in the market or may be corroborated by observable market data.
· Level 3 - The inputs are generally observable and, in general terms, they reflect estimates of the market assumptions for determining the price of the asset or liability. The unobservable data used in the pricing models are significant with respect to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
In accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a bilateral credit risk adjustment in the fair value of the derivatives in order to reflect both own risk and counterparty risk.
55

To determine the fair value of its derivatives, the Group uses valuation techniques based on expected total exposure (which includes both current exposure and potential exposure) adjusted for the probability of default and loss given default of each counterparty. The total expected exposure of the derivatives is obtained by using observable market inputs, such as interest rate, exchange rate and volatility curves based on the market conditions at the measurement date. The inputs used for the probability of own default and default of the counterparties are estimated on the basis of the credit default swap (CDS) prices observed in the market. Also, to adjust fair value for credit risk, the 40% market standard, which corresponds to the CDS on senior corporate debt, was applied as the recovery rate.
f) Inventories Inventories consist mainly of spare parts for non-current assets and are measured at cost, which is calculated using the weighted average cost formula. The necessary valuation adjustments are made and the corresponding write-downs are recognised.
g) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. In this connection, by virtue of the concession arrangements and/or financing agreements of certain of the Group's concession operators, a portion of the balance is subject to certain conditions of use, even if, in light of the nature of these arrangements, their classification has been maintained.
56

h) Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
i) Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount obtained from the application of the relevant measurement basis in each case and fair value less costs of disposal. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if it is estimated that their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met when the sale of the asset is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification of the asset as held for sale.
ii) Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
· represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
· is part of a single, co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
· is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
57

When an operation meets the criteria to be classified as discontinued, the Group discloses in a single line item the post-tax profit or loss of that discontinued operation, including the possible loss recognised on its measurement at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal, and the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. This condition is regarded as met when the sale of the asset is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification of the asset as held for sale, although an extension of the period required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset from being classified as held for sale if the criteria provided for in IFRS 5 are met.
i) Treasury shares
If any Group company or the Parent acquires treasury shares of Abertis, those shares are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under "Treasury Shares", and they are deducted from consolidated equity and measured at their acquisition cost without recognising any valuation adjustment.
When these shares are sold, any amount received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and of the related tax effect, is included in equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent.
j) Financial liabilities
When initially recognising financial liabilities, the Group measures them at fair value, adjusted (in the case of a financial liability that is not recognised at fair value through profit or loss) by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue thereof. Transaction costs attributable to the issue of a liability classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised directly in profit or loss.
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
58

i) Financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost
Financial liabilities that are not: i) contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination; ii) financial liabilities held for trading; or iii) financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see Note 3-d).
The effective interest method is used in the calculation of the amortised cost of a financial liability and in the allocation of the interest expense over the expected life of the financial liability at amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including transaction costs) through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period
Fixed-rate borrowings hedged with derivatives that change the interest rate from fixed to floating are measured at the fair value of the hedged item, and any changes therein are recognised in profit or loss, thereby offsetting the impact on profit or loss of the change in the fair value of the derivative.
ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is:
a) contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination;
b) held for trading; or c) designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
In this regard, a financial liability is classified as held for trading if: i) it is incurred principally with an intention to repurchase it in the near term; ii) it is, on initial recognition, part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or iii) it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.
59

A financial liability that is not a financial liability held for trading or contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination may be designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if: i) this designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; ii) the financial liability is part of a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities that is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy of the Group, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis; or iii) is part of a contract that contains one or more embedded derivatives, and IFRS 9 permits the designation of the entire hybrid contract as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and any gain or loss arising from changes in its fair value are recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the item is not part of a designated hedging relationship. In this regard, a change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income unless such treatment creates an accounting mismatch, and they are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss (they are transferred to reserves if the financial liability is derecognised). Gains and losses on financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss.
60

iii) Derecognition and/or modification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligations giving rise to them cease to exist.
Also, when debt instruments are exchanged between the Group and a third party and the various terms and conditions differ substantially, the Group derecognises the original financial liability and recognises the new one. The difference between the carrying amount of the original financial liability and the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, is recognised in profit or loss. In this regard, the Group considers that the terms and conditions of financial liabilities do not differ substantially whenever the lender in the new loan is the same as that which granted the original loan, the characteristics of the financial liability do not differ significantly from those of the original liability and the present value of the discounted cash flows, as per the new terms and conditions, including any fees and commissions paid, net of any fees and commissions received and using the original effective interest rate to discount the liability, does not differ by more than 10% from the discounted present value of the cash flows of the original financial liability that remain outstanding.
Changes in the contractual cash flows of a financial liability not leading to the derecognition of the financial liability must be recognised as a change in estimate of the contractual cash flows of the liability, maintaining the original effective interest rate and adjusting its carrying amount at the date of the change, and the related modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
k) Income tax
The income tax expense (tax income), comprises current tax expense (current tax income) and deferred tax expense (deferred tax income).
Both the current and deferred income tax expense (tax income) are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. However, the tax effect relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.
61

Deferred taxes are calculated using the balance sheet liability method based on the temporary differences that arise between the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, using the tax laws and tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and which are expected to apply when the corresponding deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities that arise from temporary differences associated with the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and/or associates are always recognised, unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that the Group will have future taxable profits against which it will be able to offset the deductible temporary differences or the unused tax losses or other tax assets. Any deferred tax assets that arise due to temporary differences associated with the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and/or associates are recognised if, in addition, it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed when they arise, and at the end of each reporting period, based on the earnings performance projected in the companies' respective business plans.
Lastly, the tax effect that may arise as a result of including the results and reserves of the subsidiaries in the Parent's equity is not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since, pursuant to IAS 12, it is considered that no transfers of reserves giving rise to additional taxation will be made. Since the Parent controls the timing of distribution, it is not probable that such distribution will occur in the foreseeable future, but rather that the results and reserves will be used as financing resources at each company.
62

l) Employee benefits
Under the respective collective agreements, various Group companies have the following obligations to employees:
i) Post-employment obligations:
Defined contribution obligations
In relation to defined contribution employee benefit instruments (which basically include employee pension plans and group insurance policies), the Group makes fixed contributions to a separate entity and does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the entity does not hold sufficient assets to pay the employee benefits. Consequently, the obligations under plans of this nature are limited to the payment of the contributions, the annual expense of which is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year as the payments are made.
Defined benefit obligations
Defined benefit obligations relate mainly to obligations in the form of bonuses or retirement benefits and temporary and/or life-time annuities, and a medical plan for retired former employees.
Where the company assumes certain actuarial and investment risks, the liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet is the present value of the obligations at the reporting date less the fair value of any plan assets at that date not arranged with related parties.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit obligations is conducted annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method to determine both the present value of the obligations and the related current and past service costs. The actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions are recognised in the year in which they occur, and are not presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss but rather in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
63

ii) Other long-term benefits
In relation to other long-term employee benefits relating mainly to employees' length of service at the company, the liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet coincides with the present value of the obligations at the reporting date, as there are no plan assets in this connection.
The projected unit credit method is used to determine both the present value of the obligations at the reporting date and the related current and past service costs. The actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions -unlike the case of the post-employment obligations- are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they arise.
In addition, the Group has obligations to certain employees in relation to a medium-term incentive plan ("2018-2020 Incentive Plan") tied to the degree of achievement of certain business objectives. The cost of the plan is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss as staff costs on an accrual basis based on the probability that the objectives established will be fulfilled.
iii) Employee termination plan obligations
Provisions for obligations relating to plans for the termination of the employment relationship of certain employees (such as early retirement or other forms of employment termination) are calculated individually based on the terms agreed upon with the employees, which, in certain cases, may require actuarial valuations to be made, based on both demographic and financial assumptions.
m) Transactions in currencies other than the euro
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the Group's presentation currency (the euro) using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange gains and losses arising on settlement of these transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, unless they are deferred in equity, as in the case of cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, as indicated in Note 3-e.
64

n) Provisions and contingencies At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the Group differentiated between:
· Provisions: credit balances covering present obligations at the reporting date arising from past events which could give rise to a loss for the Group, which is certain as to its nature but uncertain as to its amount and/or timing.
· Contingent liabilities: possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the consolidated companies.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of past events with respect to which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount thereof can be estimated reliably. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is determined to be the present value of the future cash flows estimated to be necessary to settle the present obligation. The provisions recognised relate to the estimated amounts required for probable or certain liability arising from litigation in process, indemnity payments or other liabilities derived from the Group's business activities that will lead to future payments, which were measured on the basis of the information currently available. These provisions are recognised when the third-party liability or obligation giving rise to the indemnity or payment arises, taking into consideration the other conditions established by IFRSs.
65

For infrastructure concessions subject to the concession operator's fulfilment of contractual obligations, such as maintaining a certain level of serviceability of the infrastructure or restoring the infrastructure to a certain condition before handing it over to the grantor at the end of the service arrangement, the related provisions are recognised, in accordance with IAS 37, on the basis of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.
o) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in such a way as to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, IFRS 15 establishes a revenue recognition approach based on five steps:
· Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. · Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. · Step 3: Determine the transaction price. · Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract. · Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation.
In this connection, revenue is recognised as an entity satisfies the obligations, i.e. when the "control" of the goods or services underlying the obligation in question is transferred to the customer.
Interest revenue is generally accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, as described in the Section d) of this Note in relation to the measurement of financial assets.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established, i.e., when the shareholders at the Annual General Meetings of the investees approve the distribution of the related dividends.
66

Following the discontinuation of the satellite telecommunications business at the end of 2017, as detailed in Note 7, substantially all of the Group's revenue is now generated by its toll roads segment and relates primarily to toll revenue, which is recognised, in accordance with the recognition criterion described above, when the service is provided (as is the case for non-core income). Lastly, it should be noted that although the Abertis Group does not generally carry on activities related to the construction of concession assets, since it incorporates the infrastructure that it operates under administrative concession arrangements by acquiring it from third-party companies that construct it on behalf of Abertis, in accordance with IFRIC 12.14, "Infrastructure Upgrade Revenue" and "Infrastructure Upgrade Expenses" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year include the revenue and expenses relating to the infrastructure construction or upgrade services provided in the year, including the capitalization of financial expenses, and the infrastructure is recognised at fair value. In this regard, "Infrastructure Upgrade Revenue" includes the borrowing costs incurred before the concession infrastructure is ready for its intended use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the infrastructure. Also, revenue and expenses associated with concession infrastructure classified as financial assets relating to the provision of operation and maintenance services (application of the IFRIC 12 financial asset model) are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with the general recognition criterion, and the finance costs relating to the concession are recognised in the accompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss according to their nature.
67

p) Leases Leases are classified as operating leases when they meet the conditions in IAS 17, i.e., when the ownership of the leased asset and substantially all the risks and rewards relating to the leased asset are attributable to the lessor, and the related expenses, including any incentives granted by the lessor, are recognised on an accrual basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. At 2018 year-end the main operating leases related to the properties at which the Group companies carry on their activities, and the Group had not contracted with tenants for significant minimum lease payments.
q) Activities affecting the environment Each year, payments made in order to comply with legal environmental requirements are either recognised as an expense or an investment, depending on their nature. The amounts capitalised are amortised over the years of useful life of the related asset. It was not considered necessary to recognise any provisions for environmental contingencies and charges, since there are no contingencies relating to the protection of the environment.
r) Related party transactions The Group performs all its transactions with related parties on an arm's length basis. Also, the transfer prices are adequately supported and, therefore, it is considered that there are no material risks in this connection that might give rise to significant liabilities in the future.
68

s) Consolidated statements of cash flows The following terms are used in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the meanings specified:
· Cash flows are inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents. · Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities
of the Group and other activities that are not investing or financing activities. · Investing activities relate to the acquisition and disposal of longterm assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents. · Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and borrowings of the Group.
For the purpose of preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows, "Cash and Cash Equivalents" were considered to be cash on hand, demand bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Lastly, in relation to the provisions required under IFRIC 12 charged to profit or loss and the infrastructure upgrade services, since the latter relate to investments to replace and upgrade concession assets operated by Abertis, the former were included in the cash flows from investing activities.
69

4. FINANCIAL RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
a) Financial risk factors
The Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks, the most significant being foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and inflation risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risks.
Financial risk management is controlled by management of the Financial Area, subject to authorisation from the CEO of Abertis, in the framework of the corresponding policy approved by the Board of Directors.
i) Foreign currency risk
The Group also operates outside the euro zone and owns assets basically in South America, Puerto Rico and India; therefore, it is exposed to foreign currency risk in foreign currency transactions, especially in relation to the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Argentine peso, the US dollar and the Indian rupee. Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency risk on the net assets in the Group's transactions in currencies other than the euro is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies and/or cross currency interest rate swaps.
The foreign currency risk hedging strategy in investments in currencies other than euro should aim to hedge this risk, and should be implemented within a reasonable time frame, based on the market and after an assessment of the impact of the hedge.
In relation to foreign currency risk, the detail of the contribution to the main aggregates in the Abertis Group's consolidated statement of profit or loss by the companies that operate in a functional currency other than the euro is as follows:

(1) The contributions detailed do not include the contributions of their respective parents as the latter operate with the euro as their functional currency.
(2) Mainly the US dollar (USD) and the Indian rupee (INR).

The contribution to the 2018 consolidated statement of profit or loss of the companies that operate in Brazilian reais, Chilean pesos, Argentine pesos and US dollars was adversely affected by the depreciation in the average value of the aforementioned currencies against the euro in 2018 (in 2017 the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso increased in value and the Argentine peso and the US dollar decreased in value).

The contribution to the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018 of the companies that operate in Brazilian reais, Chilean pesos and Argentine pesos was affected by the depreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the aforementioned currencies in 2018 (in 2017 these currencies also depreciated in value). The contribution to the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018 of the companies that operate in US dollars was affected by the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the aforementioned currency in 2018 (in 2017 the US dollar depreciated in value).

In this regard, the estimated sensitivity of the consolidated statements of profit or loss and consolidated equity to a change of 10% in the exchange rates against the euro of the main currencies in which the Abertis Group operates with respect to the exchange rate considered at year-end would be as follows:

(*) Contributions of revenue and gross profit from operations for 2017 considering the adoption for comparison purposes, pursuant to IAS 1, of the changes in certain presentation criteria in the financial statements indicated in Note 5-b.
(1) The estimated sensitivity of aggregates for 2018, excluding the non-recurring impact of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport (see Note 27-c).
(2) Impact on equity of translation differences arising on consolidation.

In this connection, the impacts with an effect on the Group's equity would be partially offset by the impact also on equity of the hedges of net investments made (see Notes 12 and 16.i).

ii) Interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk arises from current and non-current borrowings.
The borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk on its cash flows, whereas the borrowings arranged at a fixed rate expose the Group to interest rate risks in relation to fair value.
The purpose of interest rate risk management is to achieve a balance in the debt structure that makes it possible to minimise the volatility in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over a multi-year time horizon. In this regard, at 31 December 2018 82% of borrowings were at fixed interest rates or fixed through hedging (31 December 2017: 79%), in line with Group policy, with the estimated net impact after taxes (and before minority interests) on profit or loss of a change of 50 basis points in the interest rate on floating rate debt of EUR 11.3 million in 2018 (2017: EUR 14.6 million) (see Note 16), after considering the effect of the hedging instruments arranged.

73

In this connection, and based on various estimates and objectives regarding the debt structure, in order to manage the interest rate risk on the cash flows, hedging transactions are carried out through the arrangement of derivative financial instruments consisting of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings bearing floating interest rates into borrowings bearing fixed rates, so the Group undertakes with other parties to exchange, at certain intervals, the difference between fixed interest and floating interest calculated on the basis of the main notional amounts arranged (see Note 12).
Also, in order to comply with the aforementioned policy, the Group arranges fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to hedge fair value interest rate risk (see Note 12).
iii) Credit risk
Due to the nature of the Group's businesses, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk, since there are no significant accounts receivable except for those receivable from public authorities (which the Group monitors on a monthly basis) and balances with banks (mainly derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents).
Credit risk arises mainly from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits at banks and financial institutions, as well as other debts, including outstanding accounts receivable and committed transactions.
In this regard, the Group -in order to mitigate the aforementioned credit risk- performs derivative transactions and cash transactions only with banks of proven creditworthiness, recognised by international rating agencies. This creditworthiness, expressed by the rating of each entity, is reviewed periodically to ensure active management of counterparty risk.
The credit limits were not exceeded in the reporting periods and no losses are expected to arise from the default of any of the counterparties indicated.
74

iv) Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk prudently, which entails ensuring the availability of sufficient financing through committed credit facilities and the ability to liquidate market positions. Given the dynamic nature of the Group's businesses, management of the Finance Area has the objective of maintaining flexible financing through the availability of the credit lines arranged. The cash outflows projected in relation to the Group's borrowings and available credit facilities are detailed in Note 16.
v) Inflation risk Most of the toll road concessions generate revenue through tariffs which vary directly on the basis of inflation and, accordingly, a scenario of rising inflation would bring with it an increase in the value of these projects. In this connection, in relation to Royal Decree 55/2017, of 3 February, implementing Law 2/2015, of 30 March, on economic de-indexing, it is estimated that the aforementioned Royal Decree should not have any impact on the tariffs applicable to the Spanish concessions operated by the Group (see Note 27-c), since the Royal Decree does not generally apply to concession arrangements already in force.
75

b) Fair value measurement
The measurement of the assets and liabilities at their fair value must be broken down by levels based on the hierarchy described in Note 3-e.v, the breakdown at 31 December of the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the aforementioned levels being as follows:

In 2018 and 2017 there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.
As indicated in Notes 3-d and 3-e, the fair value of the financial instruments traded in active markets is based on the market prices at the reporting date. The quoted price used for financial assets is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments not listed on an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The Group employs a variety of methods and uses assumptions based on the market conditions at each reporting date, including the concept of "transfer", as a result of which credit risk is taken into account.

For non-current borrowings observable market prices are used; the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows and the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using the forward exchange rates quoted in the market at the closing date. In this regard, the fair value based on the aforementioned hierarchies of the loans and bonds at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is detailed in Note 16.
c) Capital management
The Group's objective in relation to capital management is to safeguard its ability to continue operating as a going concern so that it can continue to generate returns for shareholders and profits for other holders of equity instruments, maintain an optimum capital structure and reduce the cost of capital.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of its leverage ratio, which is in line with the industry norm. This ratio is calculated by dividing net bond issues and bank borrowings by total capital. Net bond issues and bank borrowings are calculated as total borrowings from these banks (including current and non-current, as evidenced in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, plus net debt to these banks.
In 2018 the Group's strategy in this connection did not change significantly. In this regard, the decrease in Group's net bond issues and bank borrowings in 2018, due mainly to the sale of 34% of Cellnex (see Note 7), together with the increase in the Group's equity, mainly as a result of the positive impact on equity recognised, relating to reserves attributable to shareholders of the Parent arising from the gain on the aforementioned sale of Cellnex (see Note 22-e), made it possible to reduce the leverage ratio at 31 December 2018 in comparison with that at 2017 year-end.

At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the leverage ratios were as follows:

5. MATTERS ARISING FROM THE TRANSITION TO IFRSs 9 AND 15 AND OTHERS
a) Matters arising from the transition to IFRSs 9 and 15
As indicated in Note 2-b.i, these consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 are the first in which IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers have been applied.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is the new comprehensive standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers which, from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, has superseded the following standards and interpretations that until then had been in force: IAS 18, Revenue; IAS 11, Construction Contracts; IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes; IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate; IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers; and SIC-31, Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services.

79

In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15, revenue must be recognised in such a way as to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard establishes a revenue recognition approach based on five steps as detailed in Nota 3-o.
Pursuant to IFRS 15, revenue must be recognised as an entity satisfies the obligations, i.e. when the "control" of the goods or services underlying the obligation in question is transferred to the customer. IFRS 15 includes much more prescriptive guidelines for specific scenarios and requires extensive disclosures.
In relation to the aforementioned standard, in the toll road concession management business (operating segment now representing 100% of the Group's revenue), the application of the criteria provided for in IFRS 15 has not led to a significant change in the revenue recognition method with respect to that formerly applied.
Lastly, it should be noted in relation to the transition methods that the Group has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively without restating the comparative information.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments
From the annual reporting period beginning on 1 January 2018 onwards IFRS 9 has superseded IAS 39 and affects both financial assets and financial liabilities, in three main blocks: (i) Classification and measurement; (ii) impairment methodology; and (iii) hedge accounting.
The Group has analysed the impacts of applying IFRS 9, which has significant differences with respect to the preceding financial instrument recognition and measurement standard (IAS 39), the most significant of which are as follows:
80

· Debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are, in general, measured at amortised cost. When these debt instruments are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows (payments of principal and interest) and selling financial assets, they are, in general, measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. All other debt and equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, an entity may make an irrevocable election to present in "Other Comprehensive Income" subsequent changes in the fair value of particular investments in equity instruments and, in general, only the dividends from those investments will be recognised subsequently in profit or loss.
· Changes in the contractual cash flows of a financial liability not leading to the derecognition of the financial liability must be recognised as a change in estimate of the contractual cash flows of the liability, maintaining the original effective interest rate and adjusting its carrying amount at the date of the change, and the related modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
· In relation to impairment losses on financial assets, IFRS 9 requires the application of a model based on expected credit loss, as opposed to the model in the former IAS 39 which is based on incurred credit losses. Under this model, the entity updates the expected loss and the changes therein at each reporting date to reflect the changes in credit risk since initial recognition. In other words, it is no longer necessary for an impairment event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
· IFRS 9 has provided a greater degree of flexibility in terms of the types of transactions that qualify for hedge accounting, specifically, broadening the types of instruments that fulfil the criteria to be considered as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that qualify for hedge accounting. Also, the effectiveness test was reviewed, and was replaced by the "economic relationship" principle. Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer necessary.
81

The most significant conclusions drawn as a result of the application of IFRS 9 by the Group are as follows:
i) Classification and measurement of financial instruments:
Loans granted and accounts receivable measured at amortised cost, the amounts of which are detailed in Note 13, as well as current financial assets, the amounts of which are detailed in Note 11, are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principle amount outstanding. Consequently, these financial assets continue to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9.
Quoted and unquoted equity instruments classified under "Other NonCurrent Financial Assets" (see Note 11) continue to be measured at fair value, the Group having made the irrevocable election to classify them as at fair value through other comprehensive income whereby cumulative gains or losses cannot subsequently be recognised in profit or loss (previously cumulative fair value gains or losses on these assets were recognised in equity but were reclassified to profit or loss when the instruments were sold). In this regard, the cumulative net gains at the date of first-time application (1 January 2018), amounting to EUR 24 million, were reclassified within the Group's equity, reducing "Reserves" and increasing "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet).
In 2014 the Group renegotiated its financial liabilities which under the then effective IAS 39 were considered non-material and, consequently, did not require an adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial liabilities that had not been derecognised. In this connection, the treatment of these transactions under IFRS 9 requires a change in the carrying amount of the amortised cost of these financial liabilities at the date of the change, the impact at the date of first-time application (1 January 2018) being EUR -64 million (decrease in "Bond Issues and Bank Borrowings" in the consolidated balance sheet, with a net increase of EUR 47 million in "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves").
82

All the other financial assets and liabilities continue to be classified and measured on the same basis as that previously adopted under the former IAS 39.
ii) Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets measured at amortised cost, finance lease receivables, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
The new standard replaces the former IAS 39 "incurred credit loss" models with a single "expected credit loss" model. This new model requires the recognition, at the date of initial recognition of a financial asset, of the expected credit loss that results from a default event on a financial instrument that are possible within the twelve months after the reporting date (twelve-month expected credit losses) or over the expected life of the financial instrument, depending on the changes in the credit risk of the financial assets since initial recognition or applying the simplified approach permitted by the standard for certain financial assets.
At the date of first-time application (1 January 2018) the Group had recognised write-downs on trade receivables and certain concession assets or loans, although at that date it increased the balance thereof in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model.
As a result of the evaluations performed, the Group ultimately opted to apply the general approach (recognition of the 12-month expected credit loss that results from a default event over the next 12 months or over the expected life of the financial instrument, depending on the changes in the credit risk of the financial assets since initial recognition) to the financial asset balances at 1 January 2018 (date of first-time application), recognising additional write-downs, net of the related tax effect, of EUR -32 million at that date (decrease in "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet).
The most significant expected credit losses recognised at 1 January 2018 relate to financial assets associated with concession arrangements (see Note 13).
83

In determining the expected credit loss on these assets, the Group considered mainly observable market data on credit risk coverage and the credit rating of the counterparty, as well as the changes in the credit risk since initial recognition in order to evaluate the expected credit loss during the next 12 months or over the lifetime of the asset. iii) Hedge accounting Since the new hedge accounting requirements are more closely aligned with the Group's risk management policies, and, in general, more hedging instruments and hedged items meet the relevant requirements, the Group's existing hedging relationships at the date of first-time application (1 January 2018) met the conditions to continue as hedging relationships on application of IFRS 9, and the accounting treatment and method used to recognise fair value changes were maintained. Lastly, it should be noted that the Group applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, without restating the comparative information.
84

As a result of the foregoing, the detail of the main effects of applying IFRSs 9 and 15 (the latter with no impact) at the date of first-time application (1 January 2018), as well as the reconciliation between the magnitudes of the consolidated balance sheet and the Group's consolidated equity at 1 January 2018 in accordance with IFRSs without applying IFRSs 9 and 15 to those obtained by applying IFRSs 9 and 15:

Note: The amounts relating to equity adjustments are shown net of the related tax effects including, where applicable, the amounts relating to both fully consolidated companies and companies accounted for using the equity method.

IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been applied as of the first application date at 1 January 2018 and, according to the transition options included in the aforementioned standards, both have been applied retroactively by the Group without restating the comparative information.

b) Other
In 2018 the Group made changes in the presentation of its consolidated financial statements in order, in the framework of the change in the Parent's shareholders, to provide more homogeneous information for users of financial statements in the context of the integration thereof in a higher group and, consequently, adapting the comparative information pursuant to IAS 1.
The main changes in the presentation of these financial statements affect the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the detail thereof, together with the impacts in relation to the information included in the consolidated financial statements for 2017, is as follows:

87

1. Presentation of the income associated with financial assets recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12 at amortised cost as finance income rather than operating income (EUR 24.2 million in 2017).
2. Presentation of certain items relating to charges associated with the activity of the consolidated companies as a reduction in income rather than as an operating expense (EUR 27.6 million in 2017).
3. Presentation of capitalised borrowing costs as concession infrastructure accounted for under the intangible asset model in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as construction services instead of directly reducing finance costs (EUR 48.9 million in 2017).
Accordingly, the reconciliation of the consolidated financial statements (presented in condensed format) for 2017 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017 under the new presentation rules updated by the Group for 2018 is as follows:

Operating income Infrastructure upgrade revenue Income from operations Operating expenses Infrastructure upgrade expenses Expenses from operations Profit from operations
Net financial loss Result of companies accounted for using the equity
method Profit before tax Income tax Profit from continuing operations Profit from discontinued operations Profit for the year Profit attributable to non-controlling interests Profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent

6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In 2018 no business combinations took place that might be material with respect to these consolidated financial statements.
Also, the initial accounting for the business combinations involving TTPL and JEPL described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017 is now considered to have been completed, since one year has elapsed since the acquisitions made in March 2017. In this regard, with respect to the impacts indicated in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, the fair value of the provisions recognised by TTPL and JEPL increased by EUR 2,342 thousand and EUR 2,750 thousand, respectively, and consequently the related goodwill increased.

7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE

The detail of the profit or loss from discontinued operations, the non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations and the liabilities associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

i) Hispasat (satellite telecommunications) As indicated in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, at the end of 2017 the Group decided to discontinue the satellite telecommunications business (Hispasat subgroup) effective November 2017, since it had initiated an orderly divestment process for the satellite telecommunications business in order to focus the growth of Abertis only on the Toll roads operating segment. Consequently, based on IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, since 30 November 2017 the assets and liabilities relating to the satellite telecommunications business have been presented as assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups held for sale. Also, since the divestment involves a significant and separate line of business, all the income and expenses for the year are presented as "Profit (Loss) from Discontinued Operations". In this respect, it should be noted that on 12 February 2019 Abertis entered into an agreement with Red Eléctrica Corporación for the sale of the Group's 89.68% ownership interest in Hispasat for EUR 949 million (not adjustable by such dividends as might be paid by Hispasat to Abertis before the completion of the transaction). In this connection, based on the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018, the agreement entered into is not expected to give rise to any gain or loss.

At 31 December 2018, Abertis Telecom Satélites, S.A. (a wholly-owned investee of Abertis which directly holds 89.68% of Hispasat (31 December 2017: 57.05%)) owed Abertis a total of EUR 489,508 thousand (31 December 2017: EUR 199,608 thousand), which were duly eliminated on consolidation. This amount is therefore excluded from the balance of "Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the balance sheet shown above. As a balancing entry for the aforementioned account payable to the Group, Abertis has recognised borrowings from third parties under "Non-Current Liabilities- Bond Issues and Bank Borrowings" in the consolidated balance sheet which, consequently, was not included under "Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations".
The income and expense recognised directly in equity relate mainly to translation differences and valuation adjustments relating to hedges, which in 2018 presented changes in value of EUR -5,281 thousand and EUR 2,808 thousand, respectively (2017: decrease of EUR -4,917 thousand and increase of EUR 7,456 thousand).
Also, at 31 December 2018 the Hispasat subgroup did not have any property, plant and equipment purchase commitments (2017 year-end: EUR 27,320 thousand for the development of new satellites).

93

ii) Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex) In the framework of the tender offer for shares of Abertis described in Note 15-a.i, in 2018 the divestment was completed of the entire ownership interest in the investee Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex), in which an ownership interest of 34% was held at 31 December 2017. In this connection, the main milestones of the aforementioned process that took place in 2018 were as follows: i. On 14 March 2018, Atlantia, S.p.A. (Atlantia) published a relevant event
communication announcing the agreement reached with Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) and ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) whereby, if the tender offer for shares of Abertis launched by Hochtief (see Note 15-a.i) were completed successfully, Atlantia would be entitled to demand that Hochtief take the measures required for Abertis to sell all or a portion of its ownership interest in Cellnex to Atlantia or to such company as Atlantia might designate. This possible sale would be effected in the following terms:
a) The selling price for the shares of Cellnex would be their average market price in the six months prior to the settlement of the Hochtief tender offer, with a floor of EUR 21.20 per Cellnex share and a cap of EUR 21.50 per Cellnex share (adjusted by such gross dividends as might be paid after the date of the agreement).
b) 29.9% or 34% of the share capital of Cellnex would be transferred, as decided by Atlantia.
c) This sale would have to be settled in the two months following the settlement of the Hochtief tender offer, which took place on 18 May 2018.
94

ii. On 23 March 2018, Atlantia published a new relevant event communication announcing its decision to exercise the aforementioned call option and, in addition, to enter into a put option agreement with Edizione S.r.L. (Edizione) whereby Atlantia acquired the option to sell to Edizione shares representing the 29.9% stake in Cellnex that Atlantia would obtain prior to the execution of the aforementioned call option agreement. This sale would be effected for a price of EUR 21.50 gross per share. This put option did not place any restriction on Atlantia's right to receive and accept, as the case may be, other offers for, or expressions of interest in, Cellnex shares.
iii. On 16 April 2018, Atlantia published a new relevant event communication announcing that it had not received any offers for the shares of Cellnex on which it held a call option that bettered that made by Edizione and, therefore, that it had decided to exercise its put option vis-à-vis Edizione in relation to shares representing 29.9% of the share capital of Cellnex.
iv. On 5 June 2018, Abertis sold shares representing 4.1% of the share capital of Cellnex to qualified investors through an accelerated bookbuilt offering. Through this offering, Abertis sold 9,499,013 Cellnex shares for a price, net of fees and commissions, of EUR 22.45 per share (EUR 213,253 thousand), giving rise to a non-taxable gain of EUR 79,726 thousand (see Note 22).
v. Lastly, on 12 July 2018 Abertis completed the sale of shares representing 29.9% of the share capital of Cellnex to the Italian company ConnecT S.p.A. (Connect, a subsidiary of Edizione S.r.l.). Specifically, Abertis sold 69,273,289 Cellnex shares for a price of EUR 21.50 per share (EUR 1,489,376 thousand), giving rise to a non-taxable gain of EUR 525,698 thousand (see Note 22).
95

In connection with all the foregoing, it should be noted that following the completion in May 2018 of the tender offer for all the shares of Abertis (see Note 15-a.i), the Group considered that the requirements provided for in IFRS 5 for classifying the ownership interest that it held in the share capital of Cellnex as a non-current asset held for sale had been met. Consequently, based on IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, since 31 May 2018 the asset relating to the ownership interest in Cellnex, until then recognised under "Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures", has been recognised as assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale, although, as mentioned above, at 31 December 2018 Abertis had completed the divestment of its entire ownership interest in Cellnex.
Also, since this asset was not a separate major line of business, the profit or loss contributed by Cellnex in the year up to its sale continued to be presented under "Result of Companies Accounted for Using the Equity Method" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year, and the gain obtained on the sale of the ownership interest as a whole (34.0%) is presented under "Gains or Losses on Disposals of Financial Instruments" in that consolidated statement of profit or loss (see Note 22).
ii) Other
At 31 December 2017, "Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" and "Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the consolidated balance sheet included, in addition to the items detailed in section i) above, the operations and respective assets and liabilities of Globalcar Service S.p.A. (EUR 10,710 thousand and EUR 5,790 thousand, respectively, at 31 December 2017). This company had ceased to be classified as a discontinued operations at 2018 year-end.
96

Lastly, it should be noted that in May 2017 the Bolivian Government paid Abertis a pre-tax amount of USD 23 million (EUR 21.5 million) as indemnification for the nationalisation in 2013 of Servicios de Aeropuertos Bolivianos, S.A. (Sabsa), the then Group subsidiary which managed the three main airports in Bolivia. Since this asset formed part of the Airports operating segment that was discontinued in 2013, in accordance with IFRS 5.35, the impact of the indemnity payment was recognised at its post-tax value under "Profit (Loss) from Discontinued Operations" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2017.

The exchange differences that arose in the year relate primarily to assets in Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico and were a result of the decrease in the yearend exchange rates of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso in the case of Brazil and Chile and the increase in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar in the case of Puerto Rico. In 2017 the exchange differences related mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rates of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the US dollar.
The additions in 2018 relate mainly to certain upgrades to assets of the Hit subgroup amounting to EUR 51 million. The additions in 2017 related mainly to advances paid for the acquisition of non-current assets (new satellites) by the Hispasat subgroup amounting to EUR 89 million, until the discontinuation thereof in 2017.
It should be noted that no interest was capitalised in 2018 (2017: EUR 5,022 thousand).

100

It should also be highlighted that the variations in 2017 arising from changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations related to:
· The impact associated with the sale in July 2017 of the investee Infracom (EUR -92,785 thousand).
· The impact of the acquisition of 100% and 74% of the share capital of the Indian companies TTPL and JEPL, respectively (EUR 466 thousand).

The detail of the grants related to assets -which are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed with a reduction in the depreciation charge for the year and are recognised as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and returnable assets, is as follows:

At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of impairment exists, it estimates the asset's recoverable amount applying the general policies described in Note 3-c. The assessment carried out at 31 December 2018 did not reveal any indications of impairment or, therefore, the need to recognise significant impairment losses (as was also the case at 2017 yearend).

Also, at 31 December 2018 the Group had firm property, plant and equipment purchase commitments of EUR 3,848 thousand (2017 year-end: EUR 2,522 thousand) corresponding mainly to assets of Metropistas.

Also, at 31 December 2018 the following items of property, plant and equipment were subject to restrictions and/or had been pledged as security for liabilities:

The exchange differences that arose in the year relate primarily to assets in Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico and were a result of the decrease in the yearend exchange rates of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, and the increase in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar. In 2017 the exchange differences related mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rates of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the US dollar.

The additions shown are a result of investments made in the year primarily to expand the capacity of the toll road networks owned by these subgroups and/or concession operators. In the case of the Chilean concession operators, this includes CLP 119,284 million (EUR 150 million) corresponding to the investment obligation of Sol, recognised at the present value thereof with a balancing entry under the corresponding other liabilities account (see Note 21), in relation to the agreement executed in the year for the performance of construction work associated mainly with the construction of third lanes leading to Talagante (see Note 9-iv).

It should be noted that the additions in 2017 of the Arteris subgroup included the amount of the tender for the new Via Paulista concession (BRL 1,516 million, approximately EUR 396 million).
The transfers in 2018 include, by virtue of the agreements entered into by the Argentine consolidated companies Ausol and Gco to amend the concession arrangements operated by them (see Note 27-c), a transfer on 24 July 2018 to "Concession arrangements ­ financial asset model", for an amount of EUR 101,167 thousand (at the exchange rate then prevailing) relating to the value of the unamortised intangible asset associated therewith (see Note 13-i-h, previously restated for the effects of hyperinflation in accordance with IAS 29 as indicated below).

106

Also, "Other" includes mainly:
· On the one hand, the recognition by the Chilean company Andes of a grant from the Chilean Ministry of Public Works (CLP 22,758,749 thousand, EUR 29,844 thousand, at 31 December 2018) in connection with the new stretch of toll road brought into service in February 2018. As indicated in Note 3-a, grants related to assets received are recognised as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and returnable asset balances and are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the years of useful life of the asset being financed, reducing the related period depreciation charge.
· On the other, in relation to the consolidated companies Gco and Ausol, as described in Note 2-g.vi, as the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary, it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of these Group companies located in Argentina in order to express them in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. In this connection, the cumulative historical differences between the restated costs and the previous costs of intangible asset items at 31 December 2017, amounting to EUR 167,901 thousand, were recognised with a credit to "Translation Differences" and "Non-Controlling Interests" in consolidated equity with effect for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018.
In 2018 the capitalised borrowing costs amounted to EUR 21,013 thousand (2017: EUR 48,902 thousand) and related mainly to the extension and upgrade work carried out by the Arteris subgroup (EUR 20,303 thousand in 2018 and EUR 43,723 thousand in 2017).
It should also be noted that the changes in 2017 arising from changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations related to:
· The impact associated with the sale in July 2017 of the investee Infracom (EUR -15,087 thousand).
· The impact of the acquisition of 100% and 74% of the share capital of the Indian companies TTPL and JEPL, respectively (EUR 210,419 thousand).

109

iii) Impairment losses
As detailed in Notes 3-b and 3-c, at each balance sheet date (and at least at each year-end) the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of the assets may have become impaired, such as a very significant drop in traffic and/or highly adverse changes in the main macroeconomic aggregates of the countries in which the assets are located (GDP, inflation, interest rates, etc.), taking into account the potential impact on the aggregates of the concession asset. If any such indication exists, or when an annual impairment test has to be performed (in the case of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset, for which purpose, as stated in the aforementioned Notes, the following steps were taken:
· The time in which it is estimated that the investment will generate cash flows (the concession term of the toll road concession operators, of between 2 and 42 years) was determined.
Projections for periods longer than five years are used, since concession infrastructure has a finite life and, therefore, the period over which cash flows are projected has been clearly restricted and defined (as indicated above, the remaining concession term is used).
· Before preparing the revenue and expense projections, the Group checked, inter alia, the changes in the most significant variables included in the impairment test for 2017, and the achievement of the key assumptions used in that test, against the results obtained in 2018, in order to assess any possible variances.
The comparison of the projections for 2018 included in the impairment tests of 2017 and the actual results for 2018 did not disclose any significant variances.
· Revenue and expense projections were prepared using the following general criteria:
o In the case of revenue, in order to estimate changes in tolls, the Group took into consideration the official CPI forecast of each country in which investments are made (considering the corresponding toll revision formulas established in the concession arrangements of the various toll roads, based on changes in the local CPI and/or any specific adjustments).
110

To estimate the activity of the toll road business (average daily traffic, or ADT), the reference used was the GDP growth forecasts made by the official agencies in each country (including any applicable corrections). The past performance of each investment with respect to GDP, the maturity of each infrastructure and other specific aspects that might affect the activity in the future are also taken into account. o Expenses were estimated on the basis of the foreseeable changes in the CPI, the projected activity and the operating efficiency plans implemented by the Group. o Also, the impact of future infrastructure maintenance and upgrade work was considered on the basis of the best estimates available and the Group's experience, taking into account projected activity. · The cash projections obtained from the revenue and expense projection described above were discounted at the rate resulting from adding to the long-term cost of risk-free money, the risk premium assigned by the market to each country where the activity takes place, the risk premium assigned by the market to each business (at long term, in both cases) and the target market financial structure of the related cash-generating unit. The projections are generally based on the budgets and on the most recent available long-term projections.

The results of the impairment tests conducted on the various cashgenerating units to which the various items of goodwill recognised are allocated (as well as the respective revalued assets) at 31 December 2018 are as follows:
HIT/Sanef subgroup (France) As regards the goodwill of Hit/Sanef, it should be noted that the revenue recognised in 2018 exceeds the amounts budgeted and included in the impairment test of 2017 for this year and the recoverable amount obtained sufficiently exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill that was recognised and that of the allocated assets. There is no indication of a significant risk of impairment arising from changes in the assumptions used (the sensitivity analyses conducted on the projections indicate that the assets could withstand a reduction of more than 15% in their values).
Arteris (Brazil) In relation to the impairment tests on the intangible assets of the Arteris subgroup, it should be stated that on the one hand, as mentioned above, the changes in 2018 are in line with those envisaged in the 2017 impairment test and that, on the other, in 2018 traffic -having excluded the exceptional events in the year-, tolls and the main macroeconomic assumptions were in line with those budgeted for the year. Thus, the recoverable amount obtained exceeds the carrying amount of the allocated assets, although the sensitivity analyses performed on the projections considered disclose a limited tolerance (of around 5%) to changes in the key assumptions used.
113

Spanish concession operators
As regards the impairment tests on the goodwill of the Spanish toll roads, in the case of Iberpistas/Castellana and Aucat the recoverable amount obtained significantly exceeds the carrying amount of each company's goodwill and, therefore, if the assumptions used in the calculations changed significantly, there would be no indication of a significant impairment risk (the sensitivity analyses conducted on the projections evidence clearly that the goodwill of these companies could withstand a reduction in value of more than 15%).
In the case of Avasa, the results of the impairment tests also suggest that the carrying amount of the goodwill and the revalued allocated assets would be recovered, although they are less resistant to changes in the key assumptions used (around 5%). The projections considered are above those considered in 2017 as a result of the increase in traffic during the year.
Chilean concession operators
Based on the impairment tests on the goodwill and allocated assets of Autopista Central , the revenue recognised in 2018 is higher than the figures budgeted and included in the impairment test for 2017 for this year, and the recoverable amount obtained sufficiently exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill recognised and of the assets and, therefore, if the assumptions used in the calculations changed significantly, there would be no indication of a significant impairment risk, although they are less resistant to changes in the key assumptions used (around 5%).
As regards the impairment tests on the goodwill and allocated assets of the Abauchi III subgroup, the recoverable amount sufficiently exceeds their carrying amount and, therefore, if the assumptions used in the calculations changed significantly, there would be no indication of a significant risk of impairment, since the sensitivity analyses conducted on the projections clearly evidence that the goodwill and allocated assets of these companies could withstand a reduction in value of about 15%. The projections considered are in line with those considered in 2017 as a result of the increase in traffic during the year.
114

A4 (Italy)
Based on the impairment tests on the goodwill and allocated assets of A4 , the revenue recognised in 2018 is higher than the figures budgeted and included in the impairment test for 2017 for this year, and the recoverable amount obtained sufficiently exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill recognised and of the assets and, therefore, if the assumptions used in the calculations changed significantly, there would be no indication of a significant impairment risk, although they are less resistant to changes in the key assumptions used (around 5%).
Metropistas (Puerto Rico)
The Group's investment in Puerto Rico has been affected by the worsening macroeconomic situation in the country since 2015, which was exacerbated by the major hurricanes that hit the island at the end of 2017. Despite this, traffic, tolls (affected by the agreement reached in 2016 with the Puerto Rican Highway and Transportation Authority (Autoridad de Carreteras y Transportación, ACT) for the amendment of several provisions of the concession arrangement for the PR-5 and PR-22 toll roads which, among other aspects, resulted in an additional increase in the effective toll) and the main macroeconomic assumptions are better than those budgeted for the year and, furthermore, are better than those of the previous year. At the same time, the company has a solid financial structure (Metropistas has a credit rating of BBB- with a negative outlook, issued on 2 July 2015 by Standard and Poor's (ratified in January 2018), well above the credit rating of government institutions in Puerto Rico).
The impairment tests on the concession infrastructure of Metropistas do not disclose any problems in relation to the valuation of the aforementioned asset, indicating that it could withstand reductions in activity and reasonable increases in the discount rate (around 5%).
115

TTPL and JEPL (India) Based on the impairment tests on the goodwill and allocated assets of TTPL and JEPL (of which control was obtained in March 2017), their recoverable amount is in line with that considered during the purchase price allocation process carried out during the year and, therefore, if the assumptions used in the calculations changed significantly, there would be no indication of a significant impairment risk, although they are less resistant to changes in the key assumptions used (around 5%). It should be noted that the projections considered are in line with the figures included in the impairment test for 2017. Therefore, according to the estimates and projections available to the directors of the Group and of each of the companies concerned, the projected cash flows attributable to these cash-generating units (or groups of units) to which the various items of goodwill are allocated will make it possible to recover the carrying amount of all the goodwill and intangible assets recognised at 31 December 2018 and, therefore, no impairment losses were recognised at 2018 year-end (as at 2017 year-end).

117

The following investment obligations of the Group are also worthy of mention:
· In January 2017 Sanef entered into a memorandum of understanding with the French Government to launch a new investment plan to modernise its network, which was ultimately completed on 24 July 2018. Under the agreement, Sanef will invest EUR 122 million in various projects in exchange for an additional annual increase in tolls for 20192021 (0.225% for Sanef and 0.218% for Sapn).
· The Hit/Sanef subgroup, within the framework of "Plan Relance" for French toll roads formalised in 2015, reached an agreement with the French Government to make investments of approximately EUR 600 million to upgrade the toll road network in exchange for the extension of the term of the concessions (two years for Sanef and three years and eight months for Sapn). At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 266 million had been made (2017 year-end: EUR 151 million).
· In August 2016 the A4 subgroup received approval from the Comitato Interministeriale per la Programazione Economica (CIPE) to upgrade the A31 toll road by carrying out the "Valdastico Norte" project, which led to the confirmation of the term of the concession arrangements for the A4 and A31 toll roads until 31 December 2026 (see Note 27-c). The purpose of this project, which is currently being designed, is to build a road interconnection corridor between the d'Astico Valley, the La Valsugana Valley and the Adige Valley and will entail for the A4 subgroup, by the time the project has been completed, estimated total investments of around EUR 2,200 million pursuant to the current economic and financial plan. The investments will be recovered, as described in Note 3-b.ii, partly during the remaining concession term (up to December 2026) and partly through an unconditional right to receive an amount from the grantor that will be exercised at the end of the concession term. At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 24 million had been made.
118

· Also in 2016 Autopista Central entered into a non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work in connection with the Nudo de Quilicura junction (the estimated investment in building works amounts to close to CLP 389 billion, approximately EUR 489 million at 31 December 2018), which in return would lead to the extension of the concession arrangement by around 32 months from July 2031 to March 2034 (see Note 27-c). At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, this memorandum of understanding had not yet been executed.
· In the case of Sol, in March 2018 a Supreme Decree was published formalising the framework memorandum of understanding and the resolution ordering the performance of the engineering work (both documents signed in 2016 with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works) relating to the project for construction work associated mainly with the construction of third lanes leading to Talagante (the estimated maximum investment is around CLP 132 billion, approximately EUR 166 million at 31 December 2018 including VAT and project administration expenses), which in return has led to the extension of the concession arrangement from May 2019 to March 2021 (see Note 27-c). At the reporting date, investments amounting to CLP 1.4 billion had been made (approximately EUR 1.8 million at 31 December 2018).
· Also, on 25 January 2018 Sol entered into a new non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work in connection with the new access to San Antonio Port ("NAPSA") the estimated maximum investment being around CLP 26 billion (approximately EUR 33 million at 31 December 2018), which in return would lead to the extension of the concession arrangement by 13 months from March 2021 to April 2022. At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, this memorandum of understanding had not yet been executed.
119

· Lastly, also in the case of Sol, on 6 December 2018 a resolution was handed down ordering the performance of engineering and construction work associated with the implementation of a free-flow electronic tolling system, with an estimated maximum investment of close to CLP 17 billion (around EUR 22 million at 31 December 2018). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by an eight-month extension to the concession arrangement, and the Ministry of Public Works may choose to replace this extension with a direct payment of the balance not yet settled in this connection. At the date of formal preparation of these consolidated financial statements, this arrangement had not yet been executed, the related ad referendum agreement had not been signed and the Supreme Decree had not yet been published in the Chilean Official Gazette.
· In addition, Rutas del Pacífico, also on 25 January 2018, entered into a non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work with an estimated maximum investment of close to CLP 120 billion (approximately EUR 151 million at 31 December 2018), which in return would entail the extension of the concession arrangement by 24 months. At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, this memorandum of understanding had not yet been executed.
· Also, on 31 May 2018 Rutas del Pacífico entered into a non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work associated with the implementation of a free-flow electronic tolling system, with an estimated maximum investment of close to CLP 16 billion (around EUR 20 million at 31 December 2018). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by a ten-month extension to the concession arrangement. This memorandum of understanding was executed in November 2018 by means of an ad referendum agreement, and was published in the Chilean Official Gazette on 15 December 2018, at which time it became fully effective.

· On 31 May 2018, Libertadores agreed with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works the bases for a future non-binding framework memorandum of understanding relating to the possible performance of construction work associated with the implementation of a free-flow and stop & go electronic tolling system, with an estimated maximum investment of close to CLP 5 billion (around EUR 6 million at 31 December 2018). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by a 12-month extension to the concession arrangement, and the Ministry of Public Works may choose to replace this extension with a direct payment of the balance not yet settled in this connection. The corresponding resolution ordering the performance of the engineering and construction work associated with the aforementioned project was handed down on 23 November 2018, pending formalisation through the signing of the agreement which will execute the arrangement.
· The Group also has various investment obligations under agreements entered into with the grantors (see Note 13-i).

In this respect, the exchange differences arising in the year correspond mainly to assets located in Colombia due to the depreciation of the year-end exchange rate of the Colombian peso (also depreciation at 2017 year-end), and to assets located in the UK due to the drop in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling (also depreciation at 2017 year-end).
The most notable changes in 2018, in addition to the Group's share of profit or loss and the accrued dividends, are as follows:
· The increases in the year relate to the subscription of the capital increases carried out at Bip&Drive, S.A. and Leonord, S.A.S. (in which Abertis continues to hold an ownership interest of 35% in both cases).
· As detailed in Note 7, the transfer to "Assets Classified as Held for Sale" corresponds to 34% of the capital held in Cellnex at the time of the transfer, which had been disposed of in full at 2018 year-end.
· Derecognition of investments in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa (totally impaired) as associate entities afther the decision to open the liquidation phase, cause of full dissolution of a company and irrevocable liquidation, and the transfer of the management of its assets to Seittsa.
· The translation differences relate mainly to Coviandes and Coninvial (as a result of the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Colombian peso) and RMG (due to the drop in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling).
Also, the most noteworthy changes in 2017 were as follows:
· The increases in the year related to the subscription of the capital increase carried out at Bip&Drive, S.A. (in which Abertis continues to hold an ownership interest of 35%).
· The changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations related to the impact associated with the sale of the investee Infracom in relation to the associates in which Infracom held an ownership interest.
· The translation differences related mainly to Coviandes and Coninvial (as a result of the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Colombian peso) and RMG (due to the drop in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling).

(1) The goodwill detailed in the foregoing table is included in the value of the investments in associates and interests in jointly controlled entities accounted for using the equity method. In the case of Coviandes, it arose from the year-end depreciation of the Colombian peso; and in the case of RMG, it was a result of the depreciation of the pound sterling at year-end.
(2) Also included are the Italian companies Rio de Vetrai, CIS and G.R.A di Padova the carrying amount of which at 2018 and 2017 year-end (except in the case of G.R.A di Padova and also this year the Spanish companies Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa) was EUR 0 thousand.
(3) Investment included up to its disposal in July 2018 under "Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet following its classification as a non-current asset classified as held for sale in May 2018 (see Note 7).

125

As indicated in Note 2-g.i, if the Group's share of the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or has payment commitments on behalf of the associate.

In this context, and as in prior years, no additional losses were recognised in the case of the associates Alis, Rio de Vetrai, C.I.S. and G.R.A. di Padova (in 2017 additionally to the previous ones, Irasa Alazor and Ciralsa), the carrying amount of all of which has been reduced to zero (in the case of the Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa the carrying amount of the loans to them have also been reduced to zero).

The detail of the accumulated losses of these investees, based on the percentage of ownership held by Abertis, is as follows:

126

i) Investments in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa
In relation to the investments in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa, since the companies had not passed the common phase of the insolvency proceedings as the various arrangement proposals submitted had not been approved, in 2017 the respective courts issued orders agreeing to the opening of the liquidation phase and, consequently, the resolution of the respective concession contracts was requested (in the case of Alazor and Irasa, the concession arrangements were operated by the investees Accesos and Henarsa, respectively). Subsequently, in March, April and May 2018, the concession infrastructure of these operators, R2 (Irasa), Circunvalación de Alicante (Ciralsa) and R3-R5 (Alazor), began to be managed by Sociedad Estatal de Infraestructuras del Transporte Terrestre, S.A. (Seittsa), which was subrogated to the activity and the personnel of the original operators. In this context and within the framework of the aforementioned irrevocable liquidation processes, the aforementioned concession infrastructure has been replaced by the amount resulting from Governmental Liability (Responsabilidad Patrimonial de la Administración (RPA)).
It should be noted in relation to the investment held in Alazor that its shareholders and the guarantors of the latter, including Iberpistas and Acesa, entered into an agreement with its creditor banks to provide financial support. Pursuant to this support agreement, certain of the creditor banks filed a claim against the shareholders and their guarantors in 2014 for the enforcement of possible obligations with regard to a portion of the borrowings. In this regard, at the end of February 2014 the Group arranged the payment into court of the deposit for the amount claimed, totalling EUR 131 million.
In relation to the aforementioned claims, on 27 March 2015 an order enforcing the aforementioned judgment was received upholding the enforcement claim submitted by Alazor's creditor banks and obliging Alazor's shareholders to pay the amounts claimed. By virtue of this order, on 28 April 2015 the claimant creditor banks requested the payment of the amounts claimed which Iberpistas and Acesa had already deposited into the court in 2014 in accordance with the foregoing.
127

In view of these circumstances, on 5 May 2015 the Group requested the court to suspend the payment request and on 11 May 2015 it filed an appeal against the enforcement order, reiterating the request to suspend the obligation to hand over any amounts to the claimants. In this regard, in May 2016 the Court granted leave to proceed with the request of the enforcing banks and, therefore, EUR 89 million of the total EUR 131 million deposited into court were handed over by Iberpistas and Acesa, following which a portion of the provision recognised in relation to the existing deposit was recognised in profit or loss. In relation to the aforementioned enforcement proceeding, on 19 September 2017 the Madrid Provincial Appellate Court handed down a decision on the appeal against the court judgment obliging payment to be made to the creditor banks, finding for the shareholders of Alazor and thereby setting aside the enforcement proceeding and ordering the creditor banks to refund the amounts they had received provisionally. Accordingly, at the end of December 2017 Iberpistas and Acesa were refunded most of the amounts paid into the court previously (the entire amount at 31 December 2018), which was recognised with a credit to the aforementioned provisions.
On 4 and 11 December 2018, the purported new agent bank of the syndicate of current creditor banks of Alazor and Accesos required -out of court- the shareholders of Alazor and its guarantors, by virtue of the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support, to pay the amounts they consider outstanding of the subordinated loan arranged by Alazor with Accesos (EUR 176 million corresponding to the guarantee they attribute to the Group companies). In this regard, on 22 January 2019, an action in ordinary declaratory proceedings was lodged by five funds that claim to be current creditors of a portion of the bank debt of Alazor and Accesos, claiming from Alazor's shareholders and its guarantors certain financial contribution obligations arising from the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support (EUR 223.5 million relating to the guarantee they attribute to the Group companies).
In any event, Abertis will respond with as many legal actions as may be necessary to protect its interests and those of its shareholders.
In this context, as the risks giving rise to the initial recognition of the provisions by the Group in prior years, it was considered reasonable to maintain them to cater for probable future payments as a result of the guarantees given to Alazor's creditor banks (see Note 20-ii).
128

Lastly, as regards these investments, it is considered that with the provisions recognised in prior years the resolution of the aforementioned insolvency proceedings and lawsuits will not have a significant impact on these consolidated financial statements.

ii) Joint ventures

The Group has interests in the following joint ventures accounted for using the equity method:

iii) Impairment losses
In addition to the impairment tests referred to above, the Group performed impairment tests to determine the recoverability of the investments in associates as well as in companies under joint control (joint ventures). To perform these tests, the Group considered future cash flow projections in a manner similar to that indicated in Note 2-g.i.
A summary of all of these matters for the most significant assets is as follows:

2018
Cash-generating unit

(1) Cumulative annual growth from 2017 onwards is indicated due to the estimated adverse impact of the application of the new concession framework.
(2) Cumulative annual growth for the first five projected years is indicated, although the measurement considers a longer time frame by including perpetual income.

The following should be noted in connection with the impairment tests to determine the recoverability of the investments in associates and interests in companies under joint control (joint ventures) at 31 December 2018:

131

Autema It should be noted in relation to the recoverability of the investment in Autema that the performance in the year of the aggregates of this investee, on which in 2015 the Group recognised an impairment loss, is in line with the estimates made for the current period in the impairment test of 2017 (which already took into account the new terms and conditions unilaterally established by the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government in the concession arrangement). In this regard, as a result of the amendment of the terms and conditions of the concession arrangement (the main reason for recognising the impairment loss), Autema filed pleadings with the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government expressly opposing the projected amendment of the terms and conditions of the concession arrangement. The pleadings were not addressed by the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government, which passed a Decree unilaterally amending the concession arrangement. Autema filed an appeal against this Decree at the Catalonia High Court, on which a decision had not been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
iv) Other disclosures Also, as at 2017 year-end, at the end of 2018 there were no significant restrictions on the capacity of associates or joint ventures (companies under joint control) to transfer funds to the Parent in the form of dividends, debt repayments or advances other than such restrictions as might arise from the financing agreements of those associates or from their own financial situation, and there are no contingent liabilities relating to associates and joint ventures that might ultimately be assumed by the Group.
132

11. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EQUITY

The assets included in this line item include investments over which the Group does not have significant influence or control. As indicated in Note 5, these quoted and unquoted equity instruments (which until the application of IFRS 9 were classified as "Available-for-Sale Financial Assets") are recognised at their fair value and the Group made the irrevocable election to recognise the changes in the fair value thereof in equity.

The changes in "Available-for-Sale Financial Assets" in 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

At 1 January
Additions Disposals Revaluation gains/(losses) recognised in other
comprehensive income (Note 15-b) Impairment losses Other
At 31 December

2018 118,348 251 (260)
(9,632) (14)
108,693

2017 103,948 (1,899)
28,929 (12,630)
118,348

The most noteworthy changes in 2018 were as follows:
· The additions relate to the conversion of a loan granted to Confederazione Autostrade, S.p.A. into capital.
· The disposals relate mainly to the sale of Veneto Strade, S.p.A. for its carrying amount (EUR 258 thousand).
· "Revaluation Gains/(Losses) Recognised in Other Comprehensive Income" relates to the revaluation loss on the investment in the real estate fund "Sansovino" (recognised based on an appraisal by an independent valuer) and Confederazione Autostrade, S.p.A.

133

In addition, the following significant changes occurred in 2017:
· "Revaluation Gains/(Losses) Recognised in Other Comprehensive Income" related mainly to the change in value of the interest held in Autostrada del Brennero, S.p.A.
· The impairment losses in the year relate to the investment in the "Serenissima Vitruvio" and "Sansovino" property funds, which were recognised in accordance with an appraisal conducted by an independent valuer.

The net total accumulated amount recognised in the equity of Abertis arising from changes in the fair value of these equity instruments was an accumulated gain of EUR 18,651 thousand at 31 December 2018 (2017 year-end: accumulated gain of EUR 23,761 thousand, amount recognised in reserves at the date of first-time application (1 January 2018).
The detail of these equity instruments at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

"Serenissima Vitruvio" real estate fund Autostrade Lombarde, S.p.A. "Sansovino" real estate fund Autostrada del Brennero, S.p.A. Soc. di Progetto Bre.Be.Mi., S.p.A. Autovie Venete, S.p.A. Interporto Padova, S.p.A. Confederazione Autostrade, S.p.A. Veneto Strade, S.p.A. Other

a) Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2018 totalled EUR 4,641,250 thousand (2017: EUR 1,122,125 thousand), and the fixed interest rates ranged from 0.39% to 4.11% (2017: from 0.65% to 4.11%) with the Euribor as the main floating interest reference rate.

136

In this respect, Túnels de Barcelona i Cadí, Concessionària de la Generalitat de Catalunya, S.A. (Túnels), which is in the process of refinancing its bank debt (see Note 16), arranged new interest rate swaps totalling EUR 48,750 thousand, expiring in 2034 and with fixed interest at 1.54%.
Also, in December 2018 Abertis, in anticipation of future debt issues to be carried out in 2019, arranged new interest rate swaps for a total of EUR 3,500 million, which were classified as hedges since the requirements for such classification were met given, inter alia, that these debt issues were considered to be highly probable transactions. These transactions would be performed throughout 2019, and it is expected that the issues will expire between 2024 and 2031.
b) Cross currency interest rate swaps
In 2018 no interest rate and/or cross currency swaps were settled early, and the notional principal amount was not increased as a result of the arrangement of new instruments.
In this connection, the following transactions were performed in the year:
· Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Chilean pesos amounting to CLP 206,824,975 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 239,250 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in a cross currency interest rate swap, which is designated as a partial hedge of the net investment made in various Chilean companies. Following that renewal, these hedges now expire in 2019 and 2021.
· Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Brazilian reais amounting to BRL 524,138 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 175,000 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in cross currency interest rate swaps, which are designated as hedges of the net investment in Arteris. Following that renewal, these hedges now expire in 2019 and 2020.
137

· In 2018 Arteris renewed an interest rate and foreign currency swap for a nominal value of EUR 44,704 thousand, whereby it converted a loan of USD 50 million bearing fixed interest into an account payable in Brazilian reais and bearing floating interest tied to the CDI rate. Following that renewal, the hedge now expires in 2020.
Also, no interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions expired in the year.
Also, in 2017 interest rate and/or cross currency swaps with a notional principal amount of EUR 209,537 thousand expired and/or were settled early, and the notional principal amount also increased by EUR 130 million, due mainly to the arrangement of new instruments.
In this regard, in 2017 the interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions carried out in the year included most notably the following:
· Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Brazilian reais amounting to BRL 129,100 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 40,000 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in a cross currency interest rate swap, which is designated as a hedge of the net investment in Arteris. Following that renewal, these hedges expire in 2022.
· Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Chilean pesos amounting to CLP 20,221,000 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 24,803 thousand, which had been designated as part of the hedge of the net investments in various Chilean companies. Following that renewal, these hedges expire in 2019.
· Abertis settled derivative financial instruments in Chilean pesos amounting to CLP 20,000,000 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 24,532 thousand, which had been designated as part of the hedge of the net investments in various Chilean companies.
138

· Abertis settled derivative financial instruments in US dollars amounting to USD 27,220 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 20,000 thousand, which had been designated as part of the hedge of the net investment in Metropistas.
· Abertis Finance settled derivative financial instruments in US dollars amounting to USD 103,000 thousand (with an equivalent euro value of EUR 80,892 thousand), which converted a US dollar fixed rate bond issue to a euro-denominated floating rate instrument tied to Euribor (fair value hedge), following the early settlement of the aforementioned issue.
· Abertis India arranged hedges in Indian rupees amounting to INR 6,341,800 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 90,000 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in several cross currency interest rate swaps, which were designated as hedges of the net investment made with the acquisition of TTPL and JEPL in 2017. These hedges expire in 2022.
Also, the interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions that expired in 2017 included most notably the following:
· In relation to the hedges of the net investments in Elqui, Gesa, Abertis Chile, Rutas del Pacífico, a portion of Autopista Central and Opsa, CLP 78,313,273 thousand (EUR 87,574 thousand) expired.
· In relation to the hedge of a portion of the net investment in the Arteris subgroup, BRL 74,675 thousand (EUR 25,000 thousand) expired.
As a result of all the foregoing, the detail of the main interest rate and/or cross currency swaps held by the Group at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

a) Royal Decree 457/2006 (Acesa)
Royal Decree 457/2006 approved the Agreement between the Spanish Government and Acesa to amend certain terms of the Barcelona-La Jonquera, Barcelona-Tarragona, Montmeló-El Papiol and ZaragozaMediterráneo toll road concessions.
This Agreement envisages, inter alia, the building of an additional lane on certain stretches of the AP-7 toll road, implementing a closed-toll system and granting free transit and discounts in certain cases, as well as Acesa's waiver of its right to claim any possible indemnities as a result of the effect that the construction of second lanes on the N-II and CN-340 roads might have on traffic.
The Agreement establishes that the difference in revenue resulting from the variance between actual traffic and the amount of traffic specified in the Royal Decree until the end of the concession will be added to or subtracted from the investments made in the compensation account created to restore the economic and financial balance that was altered by the obligations assumed by Acesa. The adjusted amount in this compensation account will be received by the concession operator at the end of the concession, once the term of the concession has expired, if the economic and financial balance has not been restored.
The grantor thus secured the undertaking of the concession operator to carry out extension work not included in the concession arrangement, to waive any indemnity that it might be entitled to receive as a result of parallel roads and to give certain rebates and discounts. The grantor is not, however, required to make any payment for the projects and waivers, although it is required to assume a risk relating to the possibility that traffic might not exceed certain thresholds.
The detail of the balance of the compensation at 31 December 2018 and 2017 for each of the items of which it is composed and of the theoretical changes in line with the Group's interpretation under Royal Decree 457/2006 of this compensation balance is as follows:

(1) As detailed in this section, since 1 January 2015, compensation for guaranteed traffic ceased to be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss; the related balance at 31 December 2014 was also provisioned in full in 2015. The foregoing detail shows the balance of compensation for guaranteed traffic at 31 December 2018 based on the Group's interpretation of Royal Decree 457/2006 despite the discrepancies with the Spanish Ministry of Public Works.
Lastly, this figure will increase or decrease until the end of the concession based on the difference between actual traffic and the traffic levels envisaged in Royal Decree 457/2006.

Previously, Royal Decree 457/2006 and the Agreement that it approved received favourable reports from the various technical services of the Ministries of Public Works and Finance as well as from the Government Advisory Council. Although the latter acknowledged the unique nature of this contractual amendment based on the transfer of traffic risk, it expressly stated that it did not object to it on legal grounds.
Following its approval, the Agreement was interpreted in the same way by both parties and both the review by the Regional Government Office of the toll road concession operators of the Ministry of Public Works ("Administrative Review") as well as the audits of the financial statements of Acesa for 2006 until 2010, confirmed that the calculation of the compensation and the accounting treatment of the compensation account provided for in the Agreement were correct.

However, although the Administrative Review of 2011 recognised the amounts accrued in the year and the compensation balance payable to Acesa at 31 December 2011, calculated using the same methodology, it raised questions as to the interpretation of the compensation for guaranteed revenue arising from the decrease in traffic as a result of the economic downturn and proposed that a provision be recognised for this revenue until these issues were clarified. Acesa filed an administrative appeal to a superior administrative body against this Administrative Review, which was dismissed in 2015. The ruling dismissing the appeal filed stated that any Administrative Review of Acesa would be in line with the decision of the Government Advisory Council requested in the framework of the Administrative Review of 2013 described below ("2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council"). Therefore, this ruling meant, on the one hand, not considering the guaranteed traffic compensation (and the related interest cost) as an integral part of the Agreement and, on the other, the existence of certain discrepancies in relation to the accounting treatment of the investments made and the recognition of the related interest cost. Acesa filed an appeal for judicial review at the Madrid High Court against that ruling which was upheld in full on 7 March 2017 and, therefore, rendered null and void the Administrative Review of 2011 and in the same way as the 2006 decision of the Government Advisory Council (therefore contradicting the 2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council) held that the AP-7 Agreement was valid and effective for all purposes. The Ministry of Public Works filed a cassation appeal against that judgment at the Supreme Court, against which Acesa has submitted pleadings on which a decision had not yet been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, having set 26 February 2019 as the date for the vote and decision on this appeal.
Also, the Administrative Review for 2012 did not include any recommendation to recognise a provision, although it did reiterate the matters referred to in the Administrative Review for 2011.
In the Administrative Review for 2013 Acesa was informed that the Ministry of Public Works had requested an opinion from the Government Advisory Council with a view to resolving the differences of interpretation raised in the Administrative Review for 2011 and raising the possibility of unilaterally modifying the agreement entered into with Acesa.
147

Subsequently, the Administrative Reviews of 2014, 2015 and 2016 confirmed the stance adopted in the 2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council, in relation to both the balance of the compensation and the investments made and the related interest cost. Acesa filed appeals to a superior administrative body against these Administrative Reviews; however, since these appeals were not expressly resolved by the Government by the corresponding deadline, Acesa filed appeals for judicial review.
With respect to the 2014 Administrative Review, on 14 March 2018 the Madrid High Court upheld in full the accounting policy applied Acesa in relation to the aforementioned Agreement. The Ministry of Public Works filed a cassation appeal against this judgment, on which a judgment had not yet been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
With respect to the 2015 Administrative Review, as in relation to the 2014 Administrative Review, on 23 November 2018 the Madrid High Court upheld in full the accounting policy applied by Acesa in relation to the balance of the aforementioned Agreement. The Ministry of Public Works may file a cassation appeal against this judgment, which had not occurred at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
With respect to the Administrative Review of 2016, on 24 April 2018, Acesa filed the corresponding appeal for judicial review at the Madrid High Court on which a judgment had not been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
Also, it should be noted that on 19 July 2018 Acesa received the proposed Administrative Review of 2017, which is in line with the Administrative Reviews of 2014, 2015 and 2016 and, consequently, different stances were maintained with respect to the accounting treatment of the investments made and the related interest cost and tax effect (see Note 13.i). In August 2018, Acesa filed the corresponding administrative appeal against that 2017 Administrative Review to a superior administrative body; however, at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements no decision had yet been handed down.
148

Moreover, in connection with the request submitted by the Ministry of Public Works to the Government Advisory Council within the framework of the Administrative Review of 2013 described above, in 2015 the Group was informed of the following opinions and reports issued at the request of the Ministry of Public Works:
i) Report from the Spanish State Legal Service as to whether the compensation formula could be revised ex officio in order to exclude the effect of the decrease in traffic resulting from the economic downturn and, if not, whether the Royal Decree and the Agreement could be amended unilaterally pursuant to the Spanish Toll Roads Law or the "rebus sic stantibus" clause.
The State Legal Service issued the requested report, stating that:
a) A review of the compensation formula governed by the Royal Decree and the Agreement was not warranted, since the amendment was contractually valid (as deemed by the 2006 opinion of the Government Advisory Council, insofar as it did not object on legal grounds to the exclusion of the risk corresponding to the concession operator) and because the four-year deadline for declaring it detrimental to the public interest had elapsed.
b) Nor would unilaterally amending the Royal Decree and the Agreement which it approved be warranted, either under the Toll Roads Law or under the "rebus sic stantibus" clause. Regarding the latter, the report stated that a decrease in traffic is not a wholly unforeseeable circumstance, given that the nature of this factor is to fluctuate and vary, especially over a period as lengthy as 16 years.
Accordingly, in 2014 the State Legal Service concluded, as had the Government lawyer for the Ministry of Public Works in 2006 and the opinion of the Government Advisory Council in 2006, that the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006 is valid and legally effective, and therefore it may not be unilaterally amended by the grantor.
149

ii) A new opinion from the Government Advisory Council, that concludes, among other aspects: (a) the concession operator does not have a vested right to the annual compensation balances and, consequently, any financial statements that include amounts accrued as a result of decreased toll road traffic should not receive a favourable review from the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators; (b) the compensation system set forth in the Agreement does not cover possible compensation for decreases in toll road traffic other than decreases that are caused by the doubling of the N-II and CN-340 roads (which, in the opinion of the Government Advisory Council, has not occurred) and that exceed the maximum amount of the investments made; (c) since there has been no imbalance in the performance of the Agreement, the Agreement should not be unilaterally amended; and (d) in the case of the Agreement in question, the provisions set out in Directive 2014/23/EU of 26 February on the award of concession contracts must be taken into account.
The new decision of the Government Advisory Council in 2014 expressly rendered its previous 2006 decision null and void. It justified, from a legal standpoint, its change of stance on the basis that the novation agreement to amend the Agreement does not permit the traffic risk to be transferred, that the regulated participating loans subsequently rendered the forecasts of guaranteed traffic set forth in the Agreement void, and that Directive 2014/23/EU of 26 February on the award of concession contracts requires the concession operator to assume the demand risk. Accordingly, it does not accept the compensation balance for guaranteed traffic, which at 31 December 2018 stood at EUR 2,061 million, excluding the related tax effect (31 December 2017: EUR 1,767 million).
However, the Government Advisory Council does state that the concession operator may prepare and approve its financial statements as it deems fit. However, it emphasises that non-approval of the Administrative Review applies if the same accounting policy continues to be used, and that if the Ministry considers that the compensation account included the effect of the decrease in traffic it may amend Royal Decree 457/2006 and the Agreement using administrative powers, including the application of the "rebus sic stantibus" clause.
150

Also, in relation to the foregoing and in view of the differing interpretations made by the parties, on 29 June 2015 a written request was submitted to the Spanish Cabinet through the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators in Spain asking that it exercise its powers of interpretation regarding Acesa's concession arrangement, with respect to the correct understanding of the compensation clause included in the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006, in order to include the guaranteed traffic expressly agreed in the arrangement in the compensation account. In this connection, on 30 September 2015 Acesa filed an appeal for judicial review at the Supreme Court against the dismissal of the request submitted to the Spanish Cabinet due to administrative silence in relation to the query that had been filed.
As a result of the request submitted on 29 June 2015, the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators in Spain initiated on 28 March 2017 a proceeding relating to the interpretation of the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006, and a reply brief was filed by Acesa and sent to the Government Advisory Council so that a decision could be handed down in in this regard. On 3 July 2017, the Spanish Cabinet announced that it had adopted a decision against the interpretation of the Agreement by Acesa. This decision confirms, therefore, the decision to reject the request for interpretation previously challenged at the Supreme Court and can only be perceived for legal purposes as being included in the obligation incumbent upon any government to decide on proceedings brought by the interested parties, since rejection by the administrative silence route does not release the Government from the obligation to comply with its duty to hand down an express decision.
In view of the above, Acesa requested the Supreme Court to extend the appeal to the content of the express decision issued by the Spanish Cabinet, which was accepted by the Supreme Court, giving rise to the reopening of the initial submissions proceeding at the Court. In this connection, 6 February 2019 was set as the date for the vote and decision on this appeal, although at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements no decision had been handed down on the aforementioned appeal. In any event, Acesa is, if possible, even more convinced after this of the soundness of its legal arguments, based on the Agreement itself that the granting authority and the concession operator signed for reasons of general interest.
151

With regard to the aforementioned decisions and the interpretation ruling issued by the Spanish Cabinet on 3 July 2017, it should be emphasised that the position of the State Legal Service-Government Legal Services Office is in line with the stance adopted in various external reports that the concession operator commissioned and made available to the grantor. These reports were issued by Government lawyers, lawyers of the Government Advisory Council and Parliament and jurists of recognised prestige and experience, such as Juan José Lavilla and José María Barrios (Clifford Chance), Benigno Blanco and Jesús Trillo-Figueroa (Iuris C.T.), Jordi de Juan, and Alicia de Carlos (Cuatrecasas Abogados and MA Abogados). The same stance was taken by the law firms Pérez-Llorca and Uría Menéndez in the legal report they issued at the request of CVC prior to the purchase of its package of shares in 2010. These reports also agreed with those issued by the Government lawyers and by members of various governing bodies of the Company, i.e., Ricard Fornesa, Mónica López-Monís and Josep Maria Coronas.
In addition, the accounting policies applied by the Company received a favourable report from the current auditors (Deloitte) as well as the previous auditors (PWC), and from other accounting experts of recognised prestige, such as Enrique Ortega (Gómez Acebo & Pombo) and Sergio Aranda and Tamara Seijo (PWC).
Also, the statutory auditor's reports on the financial statements of Acesa for the years ended 31 December 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were not qualified in this connection.
Acesa emphasises that, in addition to the rigour of, and agreement between, the various public and private opinions issued previously, including those of the Government Advisory Council in 2006 and of the State Legal Service-Government Legal Services Office in 2014, Royal Decree 457/2006 expressly acknowledges that when it came force "the configuration of the concession changed", based on the guaranteed traffic. Also, the participating loans referred to by the Government Advisory Council in its decision of 17 December 2014 and regulated by the Budget Laws did not refer to Acesa. There is no mechanism that enables the application thereof in its favour and they were unconnected with the effects of the Agreement. Furthermore, with respect to the 2014 Directive (also mentioned in the decision) it should be noted that its transposition into Spanish domestic legislation in 2017, under no circumstances, enables it to be applied retrospectively, an issue included in 2015 by Jordi de Juan, Alicia de Carlos and MA Abogados in their opinions, when they updated their reports in light of the new decision of the Government Advisory Council.
152

Despite the foregoing, considering that the stance of the Ministry of Public Works questions the guaranteed traffic compensation balance (and the recognition of the related interest cost), on which the parties have different interpretations, an impairment loss was recognised in 2015, amounting to EUR 982 million at 31 December 2014 and the compensation ceased to be recognised in profit or loss from 1 January 2015 onwards. This stance was maintained by the Group at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements and it is expected to be maintained until the various court proceedings in progress have been resolved.
Lastly, in relation to the aspects of the balance on which the parties do not have differing interpretations regarding their validity, i.e., the investments made and the related interest cost, but with respect to which they do have differences regarding their accounting treatment, the treatment applied in previous years was maintained.
In any case and notwithstanding the impairment loss recognised in prior years, Acesa and Abertis understand that the legal grounds that have always supported the legal validity of the compensation balance remain sound. As they have always done, they will attempt to reach a solution with the Government which protects their interests and those of their shareholders and, if this were not possible, they will defend such interests as appropriate in court and all other instances of appeal.
b) Royal Decree 1132/1986 (Aumar)
Although no receivables had been recognised for accounting purposes by Aumar at 31 December 2018 (as at 31 December 2017), it must be stated that on 18 February 2011 Aumar submitted a request to the Spanish Government for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility of the AP7/AP4 concession which it managed (see Note 27-c) as a result of the impacts on the economic basis of the contracts arising from the construction of roads running in parallel, which had not been subject to a waiver included in the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006 (see Note 13-a).
153

To this end, Aumar requested the adoption of measures required to restore the economic and financial feasibility that had been lost in order to offset in full the losses suffered as a result of the loss of traffic and revenue; and, secondarily, if the measures requested were not adopted, the acknowledgement of its right to damages as a result of breach of the related contractual terms and conditions. The aforementioned damages should include the amount for the loss of revenue from 2002 to the end of the concession in 2019.
The request for the aforementioned restoration of the economic and financial feasibility was initially dismissed by the Regional Government Office for Spanish toll road concession operators. In view of this situation, Aumar filed an administrative appeal to a superior administrative body which was only partially upheld by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure and Transport on behalf of the Ministry of Public Works, due to a material lack of jurisdiction, since it was a matter submitted to the Spanish Cabinet for its consideration and decision.
In November 2014 Aumar received a proposal from the Ministry of Public Works dismissing its request for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility, although it was granted a hearing. Aumar submitted the related pleadings at the hearing, defending the soundness of the grounds for its case based on the damage caused by actions taken by the Government that were unforeseen when the concession arrangement was entered into. Since the Spanish Cabinet did not hand down an express decision within the legally required period, on 22 July 2015 Aumar filed an appeal for judicial review at the Supreme Court, since it considered that there were sound legal arguments for defending its rights and legitimate interests, together with those of Abertis and its shareholders.
On 18 March 2016, the Spanish Cabinet handed down an express decision dismissing the claim for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility submitted by Aumar. In this respect, the appeal for judicial review filed was extended to this express decision, having set 13 February 2019 as the date for the vote and decision on this appeal, although at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the decision about this judicial review have not yet been communicated.
154

c) Royal Decree 483/1995 (Invicat) Royal Decree 483/1995 sets forth the Agreement entered into in January 2010 between Invicat and the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government and includes a schedule containing a framework cooperation agreement setting forth the general conditions for modifying and adapting the stretch of the C-32 toll road between Palafolls and the junction with the GI-600 road that is being widened, in addition to other road and mobility management improvements linked to the toll road and its operation in the Maresme corridor. In the framework of the aforementioned Agreement, on 19 March 2015 a new Agreement was entered into to include the construction, upkeep and operation of a new toll-free access road connecting the toll road with Blanes and Lloret de Mar. The investments to be made are estimated at EUR 96 million (at 2010 prices) (at 31 December 2018, the investment made amounted to EUR 27,263 thousand, as compared with EUR 26,508 thousand at 2017 yearend). The C-32 toll road Agreement provides that any additional revenue stemming from the increased capacity of the toll road shall be used for restoring the economic and financial balance altered by the work provided for in the Agreement. It also sets out the procedure for calculating the economic compensation that the concession operator would receive if, once the concession term had ended, the economic and financial balance had not been restored.
155

d) Government Agreement 185/2013 (Invicat) and Government Agreement 186/2013 (Aucat)
In early 2014 the Agreement with the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government entered into by Invicat (Royal Decree 185/2013), the concession operator of the Montgat-Palafolls up to the GI-600 (C-31/C-32) and Barcelona-Montmeló (C-33) toll roads and by Aucat (Royal Decree 186/2013), the concession operator of the Pau Casals (C-32, CastelldefelsSitges-El Vendrell) toll road, came into force. These Agreements provide for the implementation of a uniform toll system and a closed-toll system in which users pay on the basis of the stretch of road they use, as well as a series of auxiliary projects, an exemption on payment of tolls by regular public-transportation passenger vehicles operating under administrative concessions and, in the case of Aucat, compensation for the loss of property tax rebate. The investments to be made were estimated at approximately EUR 100 million (at 2014 prices) (at 31 December 2018, the investment made amounted to EUR 23,971 thousand, as compared with EUR 23,436 thousand at 2017 year-end).
As with other agreements, this Agreement provides for the restoration of the economic and financial balance that has been altered by the work that it envisages, using a compensation account that will be settled on expiry of the concession.
e) Royal Decree 1467/2008 (Iberpistas)
The Agreement contained in Royal Decree 1467/2008, entered into on 29 August 2008 by Iberpistas and the Spanish Government, provided for the construction of a third lane in each direction on the San Rafael-Villacastín stretch of the toll road and the performance of work necessary for the infrastructure to meet the standards set forth in current legislation regarding road layout and safety. The Agreement estimated that, following the recent price revisions, the total value of the investment needed to carry out this work -at 2008 prices- is EUR 70 million (at 31 December 2018, the value of the investment amounted to EUR 77,529 thousand and to EUR 77,059 thousand at 31 December 2017).
156

As with the other agreements, this Agreement provided that any additional revenue stemming from the increased capacity of the toll road, as well as from the 1.7% additional increase in tolls from 2009 to 2013 (up to 5.5%), shall be used for restoring the economic and financial balance altered by the work set forth provided for in the Agreement. It also sets out the procedure for calculating the economic compensation that the concession operator would receive if, once the concession term had ended, the economic and financial balance had not been restored, up to a limit of EUR 75 million.
Taking into account that, as indicated in Note 27-c, the concession arrangement involving the Villalba-Adanero (AP-6) toll road for which Iberpistas is the concession operator expired on 29 January 2018, the compensation balance is expected to be collected once it has been reviewed by the Ministry of Public Works, and no significant differences are expected with respect to the net amount of the compensation reflected in these consolidated financial statements.
f) Royal Decree 971/2011 (Castellana)
Royal Decree 971/2011, of 1 July, amends certain terms of the administrative concession operated by Castellana (construction, maintenance and operation of the section of the AP-6 toll road that connects with Segovia (AP-61) and the section of the AP-6 toll road that connects with Ávila (AP-51), as well as the maintenance and operation, from 30 January 2018, of the Villalba-Adanero stretch of the AP-6 toll road), to offset cost overruns for additional work, as set forth in Additional Provision Forty-One of 2010 General Budget Law 26/2009, of 23 December, through which the General Directorate of Roads acknowledged the need for additional work for the toll road construction project not initially foreseen amounting to EUR 89,018 thousand.
This Royal Decree was intended to restore the economic and financial feasibility of the concession affected by the additional work that had to be carried out. To this end, in light of the situation of the concession, it was considered that the most appropriate course of action was to extend the period during which the AP-6 toll road tolls would apply, regulated by the Agreements approved by Royal Decree 315/2004, of 20 February, and Royal Decree 1467/2008, of 29 August, in both cases until the aforementioned cost overruns resulting from the additional work amounting to EUR 89,018 thousand and the interest for the delay in the payment to restore the economic balance as a result of this, amounting to EUR 29,471 thousand, had been offset.
157

g) Minimum guaranteed revenue and other guarantees in the concession arrangement (application of the bifurcated model)
In addition, the Chilean toll road concession operators Elqui and Libertadores have an account relating to the minimum guaranteed revenue and other guarantees established in the concession agreements. These amounts are recognised as a financial asset as a result of applying the bifurcated model in accordance with IFRIC 12, as described in Note 3-b.ii.
h) Ausol and Gco agreements
As described in Note 27-c, on 24 July 2018 the concession arrangements held by the Argentine consolidated companies Ausol and GCO were amended. Under the terms of the agreement reached, the applicable model under IFRIC 12 is the financial asset model since Ausol and GCO are granted an unconditional right to receive an amount from the grantor (in accordance with the application of the financial asset model described in Note 3-b.ii). In this respect, the agreement resulted in the recognition of a financial asset in accordance with IFRIC 12 at the fair value upon execution of the agreement, net of the value of the unamortised intangible asset associated with the aforementioned concession arrangements (see Note 9 and Note 13.i).
i) Other
"Concession arrangements ­ financial asset model" relates to the balance receivable by the Group under Section B of Schedule 3 of the Agreement entered into by Acesa and the Spanish Government (Royal Decree 457/2006) whereby the latter compensates Acesa with respect to the income tax it pays in relation to the interest expense on the balance.
Lastly, at 31 December 2018 "Other current financial assets ­ Concession arrangements ­ financial asset model" includes a past-due balance of EUR 34,393 thousand (primarily at toll road concession operators). A loss allowance has not been recognised for this amount, since the Group expects it to be paid by the related authorities (2017 year-end: EUR 9,123 thousand, for which, similarly, no loss allowance was recognised).
158

At 31 December 2018 (as at the end of 2017 and previous years), noncurrent receivables from Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa related mainly to loans, basically to finance the companies owing to the payment cost overruns for compulsory purchases and, to a lesser extent, to meet their own financing needs, which, just as at 2017 year-end, were fully provisioned (see Note 10.i).

iii) Trade receivables
At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the account did not have any significant past-due balances that had not been provisioned.

iv) Current tax assets

The detail of "Current Tax Assets" at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

VAT refundable Tax withholdings and pre-payments Other taxes Current tax assets

"Current Tax Assets - Other Taxes" includes mainly:

· The amount to be recovered by Abertis, as the parent of the Spanish consolidated tax group, in relation to income tax for 2018 amounting to EUR 582,572 thousand, associated mainly with the dividends received by the various companies and the gains obtained on the sale of Cellnex by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. This income is tax exempt but, in accordance with current legislation, it was considered taxable in the income tax prepayments of 2018.
· Also, the amount to be recovered by Abertis, as the parent of the Spanish consolidated tax group, in relation to income tax for 2017 amounted to EUR 112,885 thousand (2017: EUR 113,148 thousand). This amount has been collected during January 2019.

The impairment recognised in the period (a total of EUR 132,916 thousand) relates mainly to the recognition of the expected credit losses associated with the concession arrangements which, in accordance with IFRIC 12, were recognised as financial assets. In this respect, the Group recognised expected credit losses on the financial assets associated with the concession arrangements of Ausol and GCO (see section i) above) amounting to EUR 127 million, in view of the significant worsening of the macroeconomic situation in Argentina and of the counterparty's credit risk since the initial recognition of the arrangements, resulting in the calculation of the losses over the entire term of the arrangement in accordance with IFRS 9 (see Note 22-e).

With respect to the expected credit losses associated with the other financial assets, according to the analysis performed by the Group in 2018, there was no significant increase in the credit risk.

There were no changes in the estimation techniques or the main assumptions used in assessing expected losses in 2018.

14. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The breakdown of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Cash on hand and at banks Bank deposits maturing within three months Cash and cash equivalents

2018
1,811,304 925,766
2,737,070

2017
1,268,870 1,189,231 2,458,101

The balance of this heading at 31 December 2018 and 2017 relates mainly to the following companies/subgroups:

Abertis Infraestructuras Abertis Chile subgroup (Chile) HIT/Sanef subgroup (France) A4 subgroup (Italy) Arteris subgroup (Brazil) Other Cash and cash equivalents

2018
1,133,310 494,859 441,375 229,979 235,074 202,473
2,737,070

2017
10,787 541,186 1,393,435 165,074 177,404 170,215 2,458,101

"Cash and Cash Equivalents" increased in 2018 mainly as a result of the sale of 34.0% of Cellnex, which gave rise to a cash inflow of EUR 1,703 million, offsetting in the year the investments made, the payment of dividends and the debt repayments made.
In this regard, the increase in cash of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is due mainly to the impact of the sale of the 34% of Cellnex mentioned above. It should be noted that at 2017 year-end the cash of the Hit subgroup included the impact of various financing operations carried out towards the end of the year for a total of EUR 1,000 million, which were not fully drawn down.

At 31 December 2018, the share capital of Abertis consisted of 911,565,371 fully subscribed and paid ordinary shares, all of the same class and series, represented by book entries, of EUR 3 par value each, and the changes therein in 2018 were as follows:

The Board of Directors is authorised to increase, at one or several times, the share capital through monetary contributions, up to a maximum amount of EUR 1,347,458 thousand before 1 April 2019.

165

In this connection, the Board of Directors of Abertis called a General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. for 25 July 2018 at which, inter alia, the shareholders were asked to approve a reduction of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by EUR -236,448 thousand through the retirement of the 78,815,937 treasury shares (representing 7.9581% of its share capital) held by the Group at 30 June 2018 amounting to EUR 1,168,679 thousand, which also had an impact of EUR -932,231 thousand on the Group's reserves (overall, no impact on the Group's equity). In this respect, on 25 September 2018 the Board of Directors, exercising the powers delegated by the aforementioned Extraordinary General Meeting, agreed to this capital reduction, which was performed with a charge to voluntary or unrestricted reserves, and the requisite reserve for retired capital was recognised for an amount equal to the par value of the treasury shares effectively retired (EUR 236 million), which will only become unrestricted if the requirements for capital reductions provided for in Article 335.c) of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law are met. At the same meeting the shareholders approved the delisting of shares representing all the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. from the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges, a measure that was completed on 6 August 2018 when all the shares of Abertis were delisted from those Stock Exchanges. Until that date the shares had been traded on the Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System as they had been excluded from the IBEX-35 index on 9 May 2018 as a result of the tender offer (described below) in which Abertis was involved in the year.

Of note in 2018 were, on the one hand, the completion of the tender offer in which the Parent had been engaged since 2017, and on the other hand, the agreement for the merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. with its shareholder Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. In this connection, the following should be noted:
Tender offer
Atlantia tender offer
· On 15 May 2017 the Italian company Atlantia, S.p.A. announced its decision to launch a tender offer for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. Under the terms and conditions of this tender offer detailed in the prospectus authorised by the CNMV on 9 October 2017, Atlantia offered the shareholders of Abertis the possibility of choosing between the following three alternative types of consideration: (i) cash consideration consisting of the payment of EUR 16.50 per share of Abertis; (ii) consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia (par value of EUR 1 per share) determined on the basis of a share exchange ratio of 0.697 special shares of Atlantia for every share of Abertis; and (iii) a combination of alternatives (i) and (ii). However, only the holders of a maximum of 230,000,000 shares of Abertis (23.22% of the total) could opt to receive the consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia. Also, the effectiveness of Atlantia's offer was conditional upon holders of a minimum of 100,000,000 shares of Abertis (10.10% of its share capital) accepting the consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia. In addition, Atlantia made the effectiveness of its tender offer conditional upon acquiring a minimum of 50% plus one share of the shares of Abertis.
168

On 18 October 2017, the Board of Directors of Abertis issued a detailed and reasoned report on Atlantia's tender offer in which it stated that it considered the offer to be positive from the industrial standpoint and the amount of the cash consideration to be reasonable on the basis of a fundamental analysis of Abertis (as also reflected by the fairness opinions received from AZ Capital, S.L., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International, plc.). However, it was considered that there was room for improvement in Atlantia's offer, as also evidenced by the positive performance from the time the offer was announced: (i) of the price of the shares of Abertis; and (ii) the difference in the share exchange ratio with respect to the cash consideration.
Hochtief tender offer
· On 18 October 2017, the German company Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) presented a rival offer also for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., upon which the acceptance period for the aforementioned tender offer launched by Atlantia was suspended.
Under the terms and conditions of this tender offer detailed in the prospectus authorised by the CNMV on 12 March 2018, once considered the adjustment of the dividend paid by Abertis previously to the completion of the tender offer, Hochtief also offered the shareholders of Abertis the possibility of choosing between the following three alternative types of consideration: (i) cash consideration that would consist of a payment of EUR 18.36 per share of Abertis; (ii) consideration in the form of ordinary shares of Hochtief based on a share exchange ratio of 0.1254 ordinary shares of Hochtief for each share of Abertis; and (iii) a combination of alternatives (i) and (ii). In this case, only 193,530,179 shares of Abertis (19.54% of the total) could opt for the shares of Hochtief, this being the maximum and minimum acceptances in the form of shares of Hochtief that Hochtief would permit. In other words, should the holders of more than 193,530,179 shares of Abertis opt for shares of Hochtief, the shares would be apportioned on a pro rata basis, and should the acceptance be lower, Hochtief would be entitled to withdraw its offer. In addition, Hochtief made the effectiveness of its tender offer conditional upon acquiring a minimum of 50% plus one share of the shares of Abertis.
169

Also, Hochtief announced its intention to exercise its squeeze-out right if it achieved the legally required acceptance threshold and, if the threshold were not reached, its intention to exclude the shares of Abertis from trading.
The Board of Directors of Abertis also had to draft a detailed and reasoned report on the tender offer of Hochtief explaining, among other matters, its opinion regarding the pros and cons of the offer and the reasonableness of the price offered by Hochtief, although the report was ultimately prepared in connection with Hochtief's modified tender offer, as detailed below.

Modification of the Hochtief tender offer and withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer

· On 14 March 2018, Hochtief announced changes to its tender offer, having reached a binding agreement in principle with Atlantia and Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) to make a joint investment in Abertis; the agreement was simultaneously ratified and approved by the respective Boards of Directors of Hochtief, Atlantia and ACS on 14 March 2018.
The agreement entered into was structured on the basis of the following principles:

i.

Modification of the consideration offered

Hochtief modified its offer by eliminating the "consideration in the form of shares" (and the concomitant condition concerning the choice of this form of consideration by the holders of a specified percentage of the share capital of Abertis) and, therefore, the price of the tender offer, which remained unaltered at EUR 18.36 per Abertis share, became payable in full in cash.

ii. Holding company

Atlantia, ACS y Hochtief would contribute capital of approximately EUR 7,000 million to a jointly owned holding company that would subsequently acquire from Hochtief its entire ownership interest in Abertis for the same price as that paid by Hochtief in the tender offer and in subsequent share purchases (adjusted by such gross dividends as might be paid).

170

The share capital of this company would be owned as follows: (i) Atlantia 50% plus one share; (ii) ACS 30%; and (iii) Hochtief 20% minus one share. Also, the parties would enter into a shareholders agreement with a view to regulating their relationships as shareholders of the jointly owned holding company.
iii. Injection of capital and investment by Atlantia in Hochtief
Hochtief would increase capital by approximately 6.43 million shares, which would be subscribed in full by ACS for EUR 143.04 per share. Also, ACS would sell for the same price to Atlantia shares of Hochtief for a total value of up to EUR 2,442 million.
iv. Strategic cooperation agreement
Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief would enter into a long-term agreement with a view to maximising strategic relations and synergies between the parties and Abertis in new publicprivate partnerships in both projects at the tendering and construction phases and projects in the operating phase.
v. Withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer
On the basis of the aforementioned agreements, Atlantia would withdraw its tender offer for Abertis shares described above.
As a result of all of the above, on 12 April 2018, on the one hand, Atlantia, by virtue of the aforementioned agreements, withdrew its voluntary tender offer for Abertis described above and, on the other, the CNMV authorised Hochtief's voluntary tender offer for Abertis shares, which became the only surviving tender offer. Also, the CNMV extended the period for accepting the Hochtief tender offer until 8 May 2018, the date on which it was completed.
Also, on 16 April 2018 the Board of Directors of Abertis issued a detailed and reasoned report on the modified tender offer of Hochtief stating that it considered the offer to be positive, highlighting that it deemed the amount of the cash consideration to be reasonable and included a share premium of 33% of the average Abertis share price in the six months preceding 13 April 2017 (the day before that on which the relevant event communication announcing the potential Atlantia tender offer following the speculation that had appeared in the press was published), considerations that were supported by the fairness opinions received from AZ Capital, S.L., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International, plc. This report was published on 17 April 2018.
171

Lastly, on 14 May 2018 the CNMV published the result of the tender offer launched by Hochtief for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., which had been accepted by holders of 780,317,294 shares, i.e., 78.79% of its share capital (85.60% if the 78,815,937 treasury shares held by Abertis at that date were disregarded).
Good 'til cancelled share purchase order and delisting
· Since the threshold of acceptances legally required to be able to exercise the squeeze-out right vis-à-vis the shareholders that had not accepted the tender offer was not reached, Hochtief triggered the call by Abertis of an EGM for 25 July 2018 which approved the delisting of the shares representing the entire share capital of Abertis from the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges. The delisting from the four Stock Exchanges became effective on 6 August 2018. In accordance with the requirements provided for in the applicable legislation to be able to delist the shares, Hochtief had previously made a good 'til cancelled share purchase order of EUR 18.36 per share for a maximum of 52,612,289 shares of Abertis representing 5.31% of its share capital. This good 'til cancelled share purchase order, which commenced on 21 June 2018, resulted in the acquisition of an additional stake of 3.06% in Abertis once it was completed on 27 July 2018. At the date of signing of these consolidated financial statements approximately 1.3% of the shares of Abertis were in the hands of other non- controlling shareholders.
Retirement of treasury shares of Abertis
· Also, as described above, the Board of Directors meeting of Abertis held on 25 September 2018, exercising the powers granted to it by the EGM held on 25 July 2018, resolved to reduce the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by EUR 236,448 thousand through the retirement of 78,815,937 treasury shares of EUR 3 par value each, representing 7.9581% of its share capital. The objective of the capital reduction was to retire the treasury shares held by Abertis.
172

Incorporation of Abertis HoldCo, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A. and transfer of the shares of Abertis to the latter
· Lastly, Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief, pursuant to the resolutions adopted described above, contributed the shares of Abertis acquired as a result of the Hochtief tender offer to a jointly owned holding company with the following structure: 1.- Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief incorporated a Spanish company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., in which Atlantia has an ownership interest of 50% plus one share, ACS has an ownership interest of 30% and Hochtief has an ownership interest of 20% minus one share. Equity of EUR 6,758.8 million was contributed to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., and it currently has borrowings from the financing banks for a nominal amount of EUR 9,823.9 million. 2.- In turn, that company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., incorporated, as its sole shareholder, Abertis Participaciones, S.A., to which it contributed equity of EUR 16,519.6 million. 3.- Hochtief sold to Abertis Participaciones, S.A., for cash, its entire ownership interest in Abertis, representing 98.7% of its share capital, for the same price as it had paid in its acquisition, i.e., EUR 18.36 per share. This sale was completed on 29 October 2018, the date on which control of Abertis was therefore transferred to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., which is in turn controlled by Atlantia.
173

Merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
On 10 December 2018, the Boards of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. formally prepared the merger balance sheet and the draft terms of merger of the two companies in accordance with the provisions of Articles 30, 31 and the related provisions of Law 3/2009, of 3 April, on structural modifications of companies formed under the Spanish Commercial Code (the Structural Modifications Law), with the aim of simplifying the corporate structure, facilitating the allocation of resources and achieving a reduction in costs. The merger will be performed pursuant to Articles 22 et seq of the Structural Modifications Law. In particular, the planned merger will be carried out through the absorption of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., as the absorbed company, by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., as the absorbing company, with the dissolution without liquidation of the former and the transfer en bloc of its assets and liabilities to Abertis which will acquire by universal succession all the rights and obligations of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. As a result of the merger, the shares of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., all of which are owned by its sole shareholder, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., will be retired. In addition, the aforementioned merger will be subject to the special tax regime established in Chapter VII of Title VII of Income Tax Law 27/2014, of 27 November. Lastly, the merger by absorption of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., as the absorbing company, and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., as the absorbed company, was approved on 8 February 2019 by the shareholders at the General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and by the sole shareholder of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
Also, in 2017, it should be noted that in addition to the commencement of the tender offer on 23 January 2017, Inmobiliaria Espacio, S.A. (through its investee OHL Emisiones, S.A.U.) sold 24,759,486 shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. representing 2.5% of its share capital through, on the one hand, the private placement among institutional investors of 18,253,312 shares representing 1.8% of its share capital and, on the other, the sale of 6,506,174 additional shares representing 0.7% of its share capital. As a result of these transactions, Inmobiliaria Espacio, S.A. now held a direct ownership interest of only 1.74% in the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., per the most recent notification sent to the CNMV, with no changes having been subsequently reported.
174

ii) Treasury shares

Pursuant to the authorisations granted by the shareholders, in 2018 Abertis, as indicated in the preceding section, retired all the treasury shares that it had held at 2017 year-end (which represented 7.96% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.), with the concomitant capital reduction, and made several subsequent acquisitions.

In this regard, after the aforementioned competition of the aforementioned Hochtief's good 'til cancelled share purchase, Abertis has acquired 8,500 treasury shares at a price of EUR 18.36 per share based on the authorization approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on 25 July 2018, in which, among other agreements, the Board of Directors of Abertis was authorized for the derivative acquisition, directly or indirectly through other companies, of treasury shares for a maximum price of EUR 18.36 per share and for a maximum term of 5 years, that means until 25 July 2023.

As a result of the transactions carried out, the treasury shares held at 31 December 2018 represented 0.001% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (7.96% at 2017 year-end).

In any case, the use of the treasury shares held at year-end will depend on such resolutions as might be adopted by the Group's governing bodies.

The changes in the treasury share portfolio in 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

(1) On 3 April 2017, the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Abertis approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.37 gross per share out of voluntary reserves, offering the shareholders the option of receiving it in cash or receiving it in the form of shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., using for this purpose treasury shares held by the Parent and cash. In this regard, the holders of 15.3% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. opted to receive the dividend in the form of treasury shares, which led to the delivery of 2.9 million treasury shares representing 0.29% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.

b) Reserves

i) Valuation adjustments relating to hedges
These relate to the reserve generated by the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated and classified as cash flow hedges and/or hedges of net investments in foreign operations in the case of the fully consolidated companies.

ii) Available-for-sale financial assets
At 31 December 2017, these related to the unrealised gains or losses that arise from changes in the fair value of the available-for sale financial assets
Since 1 January 2018, within the framework of IFRS 9 application, these reserves were transferred to reserves for revaluation of investments under "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" since they will not be transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss, and related, mainly, to changes in the fair value of various financial investments held by A4 subgroup.

iii) Translation differences
The detail of "Translation Differences" at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

(*) Relating mainly to the translation differences of Autopista Central (EUR -59,306 thousand in 2018 and EUR 81,055 thousand in 2017).

The changes in translation differences in 2018 are due, on the one hand, to the depreciation at the reporting date of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, and the appreciation of the US dollar and, on the other hand, to the application of the criteria established in IAS 29 to the Argentine consolidated companies Gco and Ausol as described in Note 2-g. Also, the changes in the translation differences in 2017 were due mainly to the depreciation at the reporting date of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the US dollar.

(2) Including EUR 61,748 thousand in relation to the dividends paid corresponding to treasury shares held at the time of distribution (EUR 30,231 thousand for the second payment of the dividend for 2016 and EUR 31,517 thousand for the first payment of the dividend for 2017).

178

i) Legal reserve of the Parent

Under the Consolidated Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, 10% of net profit for each year must be transferred to the legal reserve until the balance of this reserve reaches at least 20% of the share capital. The legal reserve cannot be distributed to shareholders except in the event of a company's liquidation.

The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below 10% of the increased share capital amount.

Otherwise, until the legal reserve exceeds 20% of share capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose.

At 31 December 2018, the balance of this reserve had reached the legally required minimum.

ii) Retained earnings (excluding profit for the year) and other reserves

In addition to the effect of the capital reduction through the retirement of treasury shares described in Note 15-a above and to the recognition of the dividend paid in the year, as shown in Note 15-e, the most significant changes in this line item in 2018 were as follows:

· The impact recognised in equity as a result of the transactions carried out with non-controlling interests of the A4 and Hispasat subgroups and of JEPL described in Notes 2-h and 14-d):

Retained earnings and other reserves

(*) In connection with the aforementioned effects, if the effect of the initial recognition against reserves of the respective liabilities amounting to EUR 14 million and EUR 302 million, recognised in prior years, is taken into account, the net impact of the aforementioned transactions totals EUR -5 million and EUR +85 million, respectively.

179

The acquisitions of the non-controlling interests in JEPL and Hispasat were carried out following the fulfilment in the year of the purchase commitments that the Group had to the aforementioned companies' third-party shareholders, the recognition of which in prior years had an accumulated negative impact on reserves of EUR 14,012 thousand and EUR -302,000 thousand, respectively (see Note 21). Therefore, following the recognition in prior years of the purchase commitments relating to shares of JEPL and Hispasat and their subsequent exercise in the first half of 2018, the accumulated impact in the year on the Group's reserves amounted to EUR +8,467 thousand and EUR +387,199 thousand, respectively. · The positive impact on reserves of EUR 31,526 thousand (2017: EUR 61,748 thousand) of the dividend paid relating to treasury shares.
In addition to the recognition of the dividend paid, the most significant changes in this line item in 2017 were as follows:
· The impact recognised in equity as a result of the transactions carried out with non-controlling interests in the Hit subgroup and A4 amounting to EUR -1,275,335 thousand (of which EUR 17,986 thousand relate to valuation adjustments relating to hedges) and EUR 122,442 thousand (of which EUR 5,880 thousand relate to availablefor-sale financial assets), respectively.
· The positive impact on reserves of EUR 61,748 thousand of the dividend paid relating to treasury shares.
· In the framework of the acquisition of JEPL, the negative impact on reserves of EUR -14,012 thousand in relation to the contingent commitment to purchase shares of JEPL from its third-party shareholders, the ultimate strike price of which would be the market value of the shares.
· The negative impact of EUR -770 thousand partially offsetting the effect of the same amount recognised under "Treasury Shares" following the deliveries made in the year.

(2) Companies controlled by Abertis as described in Note 2-g.i.
In relation to Gco, on 8 November 2018 the Group, as required by the Argentine National Securities Market Commission, set up a trust as described in Note 2-h).
(3) Relating to non-controlling interests in the Hit subgroup.

The increase in the non-controlling interests in Ausol and Gco was due mainly to the impact associated with the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of these Argentine companies following agreements reached on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport extending the respective concession arrangements until December 2030 (see Notes 13-i-h and 27-c).
In relation to the main non-controlling interests detailed above, the summarised financial information on the assets, liabilities, profit or loss for the year and the cash flows of the related subgroups included in the consolidation process is as follows:

189

i) Acquisition of an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4.
As indicated in Note 2-h, in 2018 Abertis acquired an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4), which gave it an ownership interest of 90.03% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the acquisition was reduced by a total amount of EUR 60,832 thousand.
Additionally, since this was an equity transaction carried out with the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that did not modify the controlling position in the A4 subgroup, it gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 28,067 thousand on "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet.
ii) Acquisition of an additional 26.00% of the share capital of JEPL.
As indicated in Note 2-h, in 2018 Abertis, following the exercise of the purchase commitment vis-à-vis third-party shareholders, acquired an additional 26.00% of the share capital of Jadcherla Expressways Private Ltd. (JEPL), which gave it an ownership interest of 100% in this company, thereby completing its controlling position, as a result of which the noncontrolling interest existing at the date of the acquisition, totalling EUR 9,794 thousand (see Note 14-c), ceased to exist.
iii) Acquisition of an additional 32.63% of the share capital of Hispasat.
As indicated in Note 2-h, in 2018 Abertis, following the exercise of the purchase commitment vis-à-vis third-party shareholders, acquired an additional 32.63% of the share capital of Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat), which gave it an ownership interest of 89.68% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the noncontrolling interest existing at the date of the acquisition was reduced by a total amount of EUR 377,700 thousand (see Note 14-c).
190

Also, "Changes in the Scope of Consolidation and Other" in 2017 related mainly to the impact of the following:
i) Acquisition of an additional 47.45% of the share capital of Hit.
In the first half of 2017 Abertis, through several purchase transactions, acquired an additional 47.45% of the share capital of Holding d'Infrastructures de Transport (Hit, which controls all the share capital of Sanef), which made it the sole shareholder of this company and completed its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the various acquisitions totalling EUR 939,050 thousand ceased to exist.
Additionally, since these were equity transactions carried out with the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that did not modify the controlling position in the Hit subgroup, they gave rise to the recognition of a negative impact on the Group's equity of EUR -1,275,335 thousand (EUR -1,257,349 thousand on "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet and EUR -17,986 thousand on "Reserves - Valuation Adjustments Relating to Hedges").
ii) Acquisition of an additional 32.16% of the share capital of A4.
In 2017 Abertis, through various purchase transactions, completed the acquisition of an additional 32.16% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4), which gave it an ownership interest of 83.56% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the various acquisitions was reduced by EUR 301,519 thousand.
Additionally, since these were equity transactions carried out with the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that did not modify the controlling position in the A4 subgroup, they gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 122,442 thousand (EUR 116,562 thousand on "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet and EUR 5,880 thousand on "Reserves - Available-for-Sale Financial Assets").
191

iii) Acquisition with obtainment of control over JEPL as a result of the acquisition of 74.00% of its share capital.
In March 2017 Abertis acquired an indirect ownership interest of 74.00% of the share capital of JEPL (thereby becoming the majority and controlling shareholder). JEPL started to be fully consolidated on 1 March 2017, which at the date of acquisition gave rise to the recognition of a non-controlling interest of EUR 14,692 thousand.
e) Dividends and dividend proposal On 13 March 2018, the Annual General Meeting of Abertis approved the payment of a dividend out of voluntary reserves of EUR 0.40 gross per share of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., representing EUR 396,152 thousand. Also, at 2017 year-end EUR 396,153 thousand, corresponding to a first payment of the 2017 dividend of EUR 0.40 gross per share and EUR 366,441 thousand relating to a final dividend for 2016 of EUR 0.37 gross per share, had been approved. In relation to the latter, as detailed in Note 14-a.ii, the aforementioned Annual General Meeting held on 3 April 2017 resolved to offer the shareholders the choice of opting to receive the dividend in cash or to receive it in the form of shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. relating to treasury shares held by the Parent. Consequently, the total dividend for 2017 totalled EUR 0.80 gross per share, representing EUR 792.305 million (dividend of EUR 722.978 million for 2016 relating to the distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.73 gross per share).

219,723 366,441 586,164
356,537 366,441 722,978

The distribution of dividends is determined on the basis of the separate financial statements of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and pursuant to the corporate law currently in force in Spain.
The dividends to be distributed to the shareholders are recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements from the time the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (or by the Board of Directors in the case of interim dividends) until they are paid.
At 31 December 2018, no interim dividend had been paid out of the profit for 2018.
If on a dividend distribution date Abertis were to hold shares that did not carry dividend rights, the amount corresponding to those shares would be transferred to voluntary reserves.

193

In this regard, the directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. will submit for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the following distribution of the 2018 profit of Abertis:

Basis of distribution (Profit)
Distribution: To dividends To voluntary reserves

2,406,758
875,103 1,531,655 2,406,758

The Board of Directors proposes to distribute a 2018 dividend charged to the profit of the financial year of EUR 875.103 thousand representing 0.96 euros gross for each of the currently existing and outstanding shares entitled to receive a dividend at the date of its payment. This dividend includes the proportional attribution of the one that in its case would correspond to the existing treasury shares. The dividend will be paid once obtained a rating equal to or above BBB in a Rating Evaluation Services (RES) provided by Standard & Poor´s and the CEO of Abertis has verified the fulfilment of this precedent condition. If S&P rating is below BBB, the Board of Directors shall then revise the proposal of application of results and/or shall take any other measures consistent with the Shareholders' Agreement.

This BOD resolution shall be submitted for its approval to the Annual General Shareholders´ Meeting.

The detail of the dividend for the years 2018 and 2017 would be as follows:

f) Earnings per share

i) Basic
As shown below, basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of Abertis by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of treasury shares held by the Group and, in the event that a capital increase through a scrip issue were performed, considering its impact as if it had been performed at the beginning of the year, adjusting the impact retrospectively for the years presented.

ii) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share are determined by including in the calculation described above the effect (should there be one) of converting all potentially dilutive shares (share options) into shares of Abertis. In this regard, the conversion is considered to take place at the beginning of the year or, if the potentially dilutive shares were issued during the year, at their issue date.
In 2018 (as in 2017) Abertis did not hold any potentially dilutive shares consisting of share options and, therefore, diluted earnings per share do not differ from basic earnings per share.

Given the Group's cash position indicated in Note 14, in 2018 Abertis increased its net debt from bond issues and bank borrowings (excluding the accounts payable to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and bonds and other assets and liabilities) by EUR 2,091,465 thousand to EUR 13,275,060 thousand.
The reduction in the year in the Group's net bank borrowings was due mainly, in addition to the cash generated by the Group in its operations, to:
· The sale of 34.0% of Cellnex, which gave rise to a cash inflow of EUR 1,702,629 thousand.
· The impact of the adoption of IFRS 9, effective from 1 January 2018, amounting to EUR 63,640 thousand (see Note 5).
· The exchange rate effect at 31 December 2018, due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso at the reporting date, which reduced the Group's net bank borrowings by EUR 158,112 thousand.

196

These effects were partially offset mainly by:
· The impact of the purchase of an additional 32.63% of Hispasat for EUR 292,501 thousand, the purchase of an additional 6.47% of A4 for EUR 32,765 thousand and the purchase of an additional 26% of JEPL for EUR 15,338 thousand.
· The effect of the investments (in operations and for expansion purposes) made in the year amounting to EUR 604 million.
· The payment of dividends in the year (EUR 396,152 thousand relating to the second payment of the dividend for 2017, from which EUR 31,526 thousand, corresponding to the dividend associated with treasury shares, must be deducted).
· The payment of EUR 634,012 thousand, relating mainly to the prepayment made in relation to the dividends received by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and to the gain obtained on the sale of Cellnex, which are exempt for tax purposes but which, pursuant to current legislation, were treated as taxable in the income tax pre-payments made.
Various financing transactions carried out in 2018 provided new funds for the Group, for a net amount of EUR 1,279,190 thousand (2017: EUR 3,966,730 thousand), aimed at allowing it to service part of the debt maturing in 2018 (with debt totalling EUR 2,878,551 thousand being serviced and refinanced) (2017: EUR 2,388,697 thousand), increasing its liquidity and optimising its debt maturity profile and borrowing costs, thereby strengthening its financial position. The transactions included most notably the following:
· The arrangement of loans maturing in 2024 and 2025 amounting to EUR 815 million by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. against which no drawdowns had been made at 31 December 2018.
All the new borrowings were arranged at floating rates, calculated based on the corresponding Euribor rate plus a spread. In addition, commercial paper issues were launched in the period, which had been settled at the balance sheet date.
Lastly, EUR 915 million were repaid, of which EUR 100 million relate to the maturity of commercial paper, EUR 240 million to the maturity of a bilateral loan and EUR 575 million to the early repayment of bilateral loans.
197

· The issue by certain companies in the Arteris subgroup of new bonds and promissory notes of BRL 1,400 million (approximately EUR 315 million at 2018 year-end) the detail of the maturity and rates of which during the year is as follows:

The financing transactions carried out in 2017 included most notably the following:
· The arrangement by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. of loans amounting to EUR 2,140 million, maturing between 2018 and 2022 (with an average term of 3.4 years) and promissory note issues amounting to EUR 100 million in order to cater for the maturity in June 2017 of a EUR 785 million bond and a portion of the acquisition of shares of Hit.
· Hit carried out a public bond issue of EUR 500 million maturing at six years (March 2023) and with a coupon rate of 0.625%, as well as another public bond issue also amounting to EUR 500 million maturing, in this case, at ten years (November 2027) with a coupon rate of 1.625%. A portion of the amount obtained was used to partially repurchase bonds issued in previous years by Hit itself amounting to EUR 140 million, maturing in October 2021, and with an annual coupon rate of 4.875%. It should also be noted that although the amounts obtained at 2017 year-end were not used in full, they are expected to be used to refinance current borrowings and for other corporate purposes.
· The A4 subgroup (through Autostrada Brescia Verona Vicenza Padova, S.p.A.) partially repurchased (for EUR 200 million) bonds issued by it in previous years, amounting to EUR 600 million, maturing in 2020 and with an annual coupon rate of 2.375%.

Also, Arteris arranged a loan of USD 50 million (approximately EUR 40 million at 31 December 2017) maturing in 2018 and with a coupon rate of 12m CDI +1.60%.

· The repurchase in full by Libertadores of the outstanding balance (CLP 90,341 million, approximately EUR 122 million at 2017 yearend) of bonds issued by it in previous years, amounting to CPL 128,661 million (approximately EUR 175 million at 2017 year-end), maturing in January 2025 and with an annual coupon rate of UF +5.07%.
· The early repurchase by Abertis Finance of bonds amounting to USD 103 million (approximately EUR 85 million at 31 December 2017) maturing in 2019 and with an annual coupon rate of 5.26%.
It should be noted in connection with the transactions to repurchase the aforementioned bonds carried out by Hit, A4 and Libertadores that the bond redemption costs amounted to EUR 27 million, EUR 12 million and EUR 14 million, respectively, and these amounts were recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2017 (see Note 22-e).
Also, the Parent took steps to optimise the Group's liquidity and to reduce the finance costs associated with the borrowings by renegotiating in 2017 credit facilities amounting to EUR 900 million. Accordingly, the total and drawable volume of the credit facilities of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. at the end of 2017 was 2,600 million (all the credit facilities mature at more than one year).

(1) Including at 31 December 2018 EUR 221,303 thousand corresponding to Abertis Infraestructuras Finance B.V., relating in full to bonds (2017 year-end: EUR 210,920 thousand also relating in full to bonds).
Of the total borrowings obtained by the Parent and Abertis Infraestructuras Finance B.V., at 31 December 2018 EUR 1,770,571 thousand had been lent in turn to other Group companies (2017 year-end: EUR 2,226,666 thousand).
(2) Corresponding substantially in full, both in 2018 and 2017, to the gross payables to third parties of the toll roads business in India.

The main changes in gross bank borrowings in 2018 were as follows:
· The change in gross borrowings in Brazil and Chile was affected by the depreciation of the exchange rate at the reporting date of the Brazilian real (impact of EUR 158,749 million, offset by the issues launched by Brazilian companies indicated above) and the Chilean peso (impact of EUR -86,714 million). On the other hand, in the case of Puerto Rico the increase in the Group's gross borrowings was affected by the appreciation of the exchange rate at the reporting date of the US dollar (impact of EUR 32,998 million).
· Also, the reduction in gross borrowings at Abertis France and Chile was due mainly to the repayment of borrowings in the year (EUR 915 million, EUR 620 million and EUR 313 million, respectively).
The weighted average interest rate in 2018 on bond issues and bank borrowings was 3.73% (2017: 4.04%).

The Group's borrowings based on the contractually stipulated cash flows, taking into consideration the related hedges referred to Note 12, are denominated in the following currencies:

(*) The amounts of borrowings shown in the foregoing table relate to the cash flows provided for in the related agreements, converted at the closing exchange rate or at the fixed in the associated coverage, which also differ from the carrying amount of the borrowings due to the effect of applying IFRS 9 in relation to the borrowings arranged.

As indicated in Note 12, a portion of the borrowings in US dollars and all the borrowings in Japanese yen are converted to euros through derivative financial instruments.

The detail of the bank borrowings by maturity based on the amounts payable to maturity at each reporting date, as provided for in the respective contracts, is as follows:

Of the EUR 16,396,738 thousand, EUR 10,159,223 thousand (62%) relate to debt of subsidiaries without recourse to Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (2017: EUR 11,051,076 thousand (61%)).

203

At 31 December 2018, the average term to maturity of the debt was 5.0 years (2017 year-end: 5.3 years).

Also, interest on the aforementioned loans and bonds accrues and is settled on the basis of the specific terms and conditions and maturities. In 2019 interest on the borrowings based on the debt at 31 December 2018 is expected to amount to approximately EUR 617 million (EUR 686 million estimated at 2017 year-end for 2018).

At 31 December 2018, 82% (2017: 79%) of the borrowings bore a fixed interest rate or a rate fixed through hedges. Therefore, possible interest rate fluctuations are not expected to have a significant impact on these consolidated financial statements.

The estimated sensitivity of the consolidated statement of profit or loss to a 50 bp change in the interest rates applied to the floating-rate debt is as follows:

In addition, it should be noted in relation to the sensitivity of derivative transactions to interest rate fluctuations that, in terms of the derivative transactions analysed at 31 December 2018 taken as a whole, with a 50 bp change in the EUR, USD, YEN, INR, CLP and BRL interest rate curves, and other variables staying constant, the fair value of the derivative transactions taken as a whole would have changed by EUR 165 million (2017: EUR 29 million), with a net impact of EUR 124 million on equity and virtually no impact on profit after tax (2017: impact of EUR 21 million on equity and again virtually no impact on profit after tax).

Lastly, the detail of the carrying amount and fair value of the bonds and non-current bank borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

The carrying amount of the current bank borrowings approximates their fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate borrowings is calculated by discounting the payment flows of each debt by the interest rate curve of the currency to which they are tied, and in the case of bonds, the issuer's credit curve is added, which is estimated on the basis of the market prices of the liquid obligations observed for the same issuer in its reference markets.

211

Lastly, it should be noted that since 20 April 2017 Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. has had a EUR 500 million promissory note issue programme registered (in force at 31 October 2018), against which no amount had been drawn down at 31 October 2018 (2017 year-end: EUR 100 million).

iii) Other bank borrowings
As at 2017 year-end, at 2018 year-end the other non-current bank borrowings related to the account payable for the acquisition in 2016 of 51.4% of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) for EUR 594 million, of which EUR 589 million will be paid in February 2023 (present value of EUR 509 million at 31 December 2018 and EUR 491 million at 31 December 2017).
It should be noted in this regard that the seller factored the receivables from Abertis to a syndicate of banks (with Abertis as a party to the arrangement) and, accordingly, in 2016 those banks became creditors of the Group.

212

iv) Corporate rating At the date of formal preparation of these consolidated financial statements Abertis had a long-term "BBB" investment-grade adequate credit quality rating awarded by the international credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Ltd. In the latest report, dated October 2018, the "BBB" rating and "stable" outlook were ratified. In addition, in the latest report, dated October 2018, Abertis was awarded a long-term "BBB" credit rating and a short-term "F3" credit rating by the international credit rating agency Fitch Ratings Ltd. The aforementioned latest report also revised the outlook from "negative" to "stable".

18. PAYABLE TO SUPPLIERS AND OTHER PAYABLES

The detail of "Payable to Suppliers and Other Payables" at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Trade payables Payable to non-current asset suppliers Payable to related parties Remuneration payable Other payables Payable to suppliers and other payables

2018 416,964 21,509 7,300 97,235 20,061 563,069

2017 521,546 20,564 1,683 111,361 16,874 672,028

The decrease in this line item was affected by the depreciation of the exchange rate of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso against the euro.

Also, for the Group companies with tax residence in Spain, the following information is required by Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010, of 5 July ("Disclosure Requirement"), amended by Final Provision Two of Law 31/2014, of 3 December, amending the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law to improve corporate governance, in accordance with the Resolution of 29 January 2016 of the Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute on disclosures to be included in the notes to financial statements for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 in relation to the average period of payment to suppliers in commercial transactions, published in the Official State Gazette on 4 February 2016:

(1) The maximum payment period applicable to the Group companies with tax residence in Spain is, under Law 11/2013, of 26 July, 30 days, unless a longer period has been contractually specified, although such period may not exceed 60 days.

The payments shown in the foregoing table in relation to payments to suppliers relate to suppliers that because of their nature are trade creditors for the supply of goods and services and, therefore, they are included under "Payable to Suppliers and Other Payables" in the consolidated balance sheet.

215

19. INCOME TAX
a) Tax-related disclosures
At the end of 2018 Abertis filed consolidated tax returns as the parent of the tax group, the subsidiaries of which are the investees that are at least 75%-owned by it and that are resident for tax purposes in Spain. In this regard, as result of the change of shareholders described in Note 15-a, from 1 January 2019 Abertis files consolidated income tax in a new tax group which the parent is Abertis HoldCo, S.A. Also, the Group's subsidiaries with tax residence in France and Italy file consolidated income tax returns in those countries. The other companies included in the scope of consolidation file individual tax returns (except the Hispasat subgroup, see Note 7).
At 31 December 2018, in general the Group companies had open for review by the tax authorities all the taxes applicable to them for which the statute of limitations period had not expired at that date in each of the jurisdictions where they are located.
It should be noted in this connection that:
· In July 2018 Abertis received notification of the commencement of tax audits of the consolidated tax group in Spain for 2014 to 2016 in relation to income tax and for June 2014 to December 2016 for VAT.
· In Spain, the tax group the parent of which is Abertis received tax assessments for income tax for 2010 to 2013, personal income tax withholdings for 2012 and 2013 and VAT for July 2011 to December 2013. Those assessments were signed on a contested basis and were appealed against; at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements no decision thereon had been handed down.
· In France in 2017 Hit received a tax assessment for income tax for 2014, which did not have a significant impact on equity. A decision was handed down in Hit's favour in relation to the appeal filed in 2018 against the aforementioned tax assessment.
216

In this regard, as at 2017 year-end, Abertis considers that any tax audits under way, the proceedings associated with the tax assessments signed on a contested basis and possible differences in the way current tax legislation is interpreted in relation to the years open for review will not have a significant impact on the equity reflected in these consolidated financial statements.
Lastly, it should be noted that in 2007 the European Commission initiated an investigation procedure against the Kingdom of Spain in relation to State aid relating to Article 12.5 of the former Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law. In this connection, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 (First Decision) on acquisitions within the EU and Decision 2011/282/EU of 12 January 2011 (Second Decision) on foreign shareholding acquisitions, stating that the deduction regulated by Article 12.5 of the Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law constituted unlawful State aid. In addition to the foregoing, the Commission adopted Decision 2015/314/EU of 15 October 2014 (Third Decision) also classifying as State aid the deductions that applied under Article 12.5 of the Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law in the case of indirect acquisitions (Third Decision). On 1 April 2015, Abertis filed an action for annulment at the General Court of the European Union against the Third Decision of the Commission, a proceeding that was immediately stayed by the Court until judgments had been handed down on the cassation appeals filed by the Commission against two judgments of the General Court on the Decisions of 2009 and 2011 on this issue.
Since the cassation appeals against the First and Second Decisions were upheld, in the first quarter of 2017 the General Court of the European Union ordered the end of the stay of all the actions for annulment against the Third Decision and the re-initiation of the proceedings affected, including that brought by Abertis. Therefore, on 24 March 2017 the European Commission lodged a defence with the General Court, following which Abertis lodged the related reply on 30 May 2017. At the end of this proceeding the General Court of the European Union must hand down a judgment analysing the solid legal grounds presented by Abertis against the Third Decision.
217

In this connection, on 15 November 2018, the General Court dismissed the appeals against the First and Second Decisions of the Commission, upholding that the amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes constituted State aid incompatible with the internal market, although it confirmed the existence of legitimate expectations in the cases of acquisitions prior to 21 December 2007. These decisions may be appealed at the Court of Justice of the European Union. The appeal filed by Abertis against the Third Decision is in progress at the same chamber of the General Court of the European Union and the aforementioned decisions do not prejudge the specific issues of a different nature raised by Abertis in its appeal against the Third Decision.
In any case, the resolution of this matter is not expected to have a negative impact on the Parent's equity because either it has returned the corresponding amount plus late-payment interest, or because it had already recognised a deferred tax liability associated with the goodwill deducted to date which has not yet been actually returned to the Spanish tax authorities.

b) Income tax expense

The standard income tax rates in the main countries in which Abertis carries on its operations are as follows:

Spain France (1) Italy (2) Brazil Chile (3)

2018 25% 34.4% 24% + 3.9% 34% 27.0%

2017 25% 39.4% 24% + 3.9% 34% 25.5%

(1) An amendment to the French General State Budget Law for 2017 approved in December 2017 established an increase in the income tax rate for large companies from 34.43% to 39.43% solely for 2017. In addition, the income tax rate in France envisaged for 2020 remained at 28% and an additional reduction of the rate to 25% in 2022 was included in the Budget Law.
(2) The Italian companies are subject to the income tax known as IRES (Imposta sul reddito sulle società) at a rate of 24%, and to the IRAP (Imposta regionale sulle attività produttive) at a rate of 3.9%, although the IRAP tax base is broadly equivalent to the gross margin of the company.
(3) Law 20.780, of 28 September 2014, on the Reform of the Chilean tax system, established a gradual increase in the income tax rate in Chile over five years from 21% in 2014 to 27% from 2018 onwards (it is assumed that the Abertis Group companies will apply the income tax calculation system known as the "parcialmente integrado" (partially integrated) system.

218

It should be noted that an amendment to the Vizcaya Income Tax Regulation was approved in Spain in March 2018, giving rise to a reduction in the tax rate to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (until 2017 the tax rate was 28%).
Also, it should be noted that the French General State Budget Law for 2018 approved in December 2017 established, on the one hand, an increase solely for 2017 in the income tax rate from 34.43% to 39.43% (maintaining the envisaged reduction to 28% in 2020) and, on the other, included an additional reduction to 25% in 2022.
The reconciliation of the theoretical tax expense to the tax expense recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year is as follows:

Profit before tax

2018 2,163,449

2017 1,291,227

Theoretical tax rate - 25% in 2018 and 2017 (1) Effect on the tax expense of:

(22,526) 6,459

(1) The impact of the different tax rates in certain countries, as well as the profit or loss of companies accounted for using the equity method (taxed at source), is reflected in the other line items (mainly in "Other Tax Effects").
(2) In 2018 it relates, on the one hand, to Spain in connection with the reduction, in the Province of Vizcaya, of the tax rate from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (EUR 14,330 thousand) and, on the other, to Argentina due to the reduction of the tax rate from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand). In 2017 it related to France and the reduction in the tax rate from 28% to 25% from 2022 onwards (EUR 20,831 thousand).

"Non-Taxable Income" and "Non-Deductible Expenses" in 2018 and 2017 include items that, in accordance with the tax legislation applicable to the respective consolidated companies, are not taxable or deductible, respectively.

219

In this regard, at 2018 year-end "Non-Taxable Income" includes mainly the tax effect associated with the gain on the sale of Cellnex, and the tax effect associated with the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession contracts until December 2030.

The main components of the income tax expense for the year (for the fully consolidated companies) are as follows:

Current tax Deferred taxes:
Change in tax rate (1) Changes in deferred taxes (2) Other Tax expense (continuing operations)

2018 471,115
(15,687) (150,295)

11,184

Tax effects recognised in equity

11,863 285,788

26,326 402,080

(1) In 2018 it relates, on the one hand, to Spain in connection with the reduction, in the Province of Vizcaya, of the tax rate from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (EUR 14,330 thousand) and, on the other, to Argentina due to the reduction of the tax rate from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand). In 2017 it related to France and the reduction in the tax rate from 28% to 25% from 2022 onwards (EUR 20,831 thousand).
(2) In addition, in 2017 a EUR -1,759 thousand change associated with the satellite telecommunications business until it was discontinued must be taken into account.

As a result of the reduction in the income tax rate from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards in the Province of Vizcaya (Spain), the Group company with tax residence in this province (Avasa) recognised a reduction of EUR 14,330 thousand in the current income tax expense for the year mainly as a result of the decrease in net deferred tax liabilities that were expected to reverse in 2018 and subsequent years.

The change in deferred taxes was due mainly to the effect of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities associated with business combinations detailed below.

220

The income tax for 2017 included, in addition to the effect of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities associated with business combinations, the following:
· As a result of the one-off increase for 2017 in the standard income tax rate in France from 34.4% to 39.4%, the Group companies with tax residence in France recognised a higher income tax expense accrued in the year (current tax) amounting to EUR -30,010 thousand.
· On the other hand, as a result of the reduction in the standard income tax rate in France from 28% to 25% from 2022 onwards, the Group companies with tax residence in France recognised a reduction of EUR 20,831 thousand in the income tax expense for 2017 mainly as a result of the decrease in net deferred tax liabilities that were expected to reverse in 2022 and subsequent years.
· In addition, in December 2017 an amendment to the French General State Budget Law for 2017 was approved which eliminated the 3% tax on dividends distributed by French companies, and also permitted the refund of the amounts paid in this connection by French companies in 2017 and prior years. In this respect, in 2013 the French company Hit began an appeals process against the application of this tax and in December 2017 the related appeals were upheld resulting, among other impacts, in the recognition of a refund of EUR 25,651 thousand which was paid in 2017.
Lastly, it should be noted that Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, which came into force on 1 January 2016, established the obligation to reverse those impairment losses on holdings in the share capital or equity of entities that were deductible for income tax purposes in the income tax base in tax periods commencing prior to 1 January 2013. The amount reversed shall be included, at least, in equal parts in the tax base for each of the first five tax periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.
The aforementioned Royal Decree-Law also limited the offset of tax losses to 25% of the tax base prior to offset. This change will not affect the recoverability of deferred tax assets recognised at the Group (see Section c.i) of this Note).

(1) In 2018 it included the impact indicated in b) above due to the change in the tax rate in the Province of Vizcaya in Spain (EUR 14,330 thousand) and the change in the tax rate in Argentina from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand). In 2017 it included the aforementioned impact of the change in the tax rate in France (EUR 20,831 thousand).

The exchange differences arising in the year relate mainly to deferred tax assets and liabilities of companies with tax residence in Brazil (BRL 556,482 thousand and BRL 429,609 thousand, respectively, in 2018, and BRL 447,481 thousand and BRL 539,483 thousand, respectively, in 2017), and to deferred tax assets and liabilities of Chilean companies (CLP 94,761,214 thousand and CLP 387,303,468 thousand, respectively, in 2018, and CLP 123,334,616 thousand and CLP 449,121,122 thousand, respectively, in 2017), as a result of the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso at year-end (2017 year-end also depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso).

222

It should also be noted, in relation to the consolidated companies Gco and Ausol, as described in Note 2-g.vi, that as the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary, it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of these Group companies located in Argentina in order to express them in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. In this connection, the cumulative historical differences between the restated costs and the previous costs of deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2017, amounting to EUR -29,230 thousand, were recognised with a credit to "Translation Differences" and "Non-Controlling Interests" in consolidated equity with effect for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018.
Also, the changes in 2017 arising from changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations related to:
· The impact associated with the sale in July 2017 of the investee Infracom (EUR -6,494 thousand of deferred tax assets and EUR 13,091 thousand of deferred tax liabilities).
· The impact of the acquisition of 100% and 74% of the share capital of the Indian companies TTPL and JEPL, respectively (EUR -19,420 thousand of deferred tax liabilities).

(1) In the case of the Arteris subgroup, the change was brought about by the depreciation at year-end of the Brazilian real and in the case of Autopista Central, Libertadores, Sol, Los Andes, Rutas del Pacífico and the Invin subgroup, the change was brought about by the depreciation of the Chilean peso at year-end. In the case of TTPL and JEPL the change was brought about by the depreciation of the Indian rupee.
(2) In the case of Avasa, the change was brought about by the amendment to the Vizcaya Income Tax Regulation that was approved in Spain in March 2018, giving rise to a reduction in the tax rate to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (until 2017 the tax rate was 28%).

a) Pension obligations
Among the obligations to their employees, various Group companies in Spain sponsor defined contribution employment-based pension plans and/or have defined contribution and/or defined benefit pension obligations, arranged through insurance policies, as provided for in the legislation governing the externalisation of pension obligations.

226

Abroad, various Group companies have defined contribution and/or defined benefit obligations to their employees. These obligations are instrumented through external entities, except in countries where local legislation allows internal allowances to be set up.
The economic-actuarial information on the existing liability for the various Group companies' pension obligations to their employees is as follows:
i) Defined contribution obligations
The amount recognised as staff costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in relation to defined contribution obligations totalled EUR 6,649 thousand (2017: EUR 7,699 thousand) (see Note 22-c).
ii) Defined benefit obligations
Except in countries where local legislation allows internal allowances to be set up, pension obligations are instrumented through insurance policies or separate entities, in accordance with the applicable legislation in each country, and are not included in the balance sheet. However, this line item includes the obligations and the related plan assets in cases in which the legal or constructive obligation to provide the benefits agreed upon is retained.
In relation to obligations of this nature, at 31 December 2018 (as at 31 December 2017), Abertis had pension obligations relating to defined benefit plans in the following countries:
· In Spain, Abertis, Aumar, Acesa, Invicat and Aucat have pension obligations arising from retirement bonuses regulated in collective agreements. These obligations are financed externally pursuant to local legislation.
· In France, the Hit/Sanef subgroup companies and Emovis and Eurotoll offer retirement bonuses corresponding to a legal obligation (IFC). In addition, Sapn has a healthcare plan for retired former employees.
227

· In Italy, A4 offers termination indemnities corresponding to a legal obligation (TFR: Trattamento di fine Rapporto). Since 1 July 2007, the benefit rights of employees of companies in the subgroup with more than 50 employees are covered by other external systems (National Social Security Institute (INPS) or a defined contribution pension plan) and, therefore, the TFR plan does not offer additional rights for services beyond this date at those companies. The TFR is not externally financed.

In relation to the aforementioned defined benefit obligations of the various Group companies to their employees, the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the actuarial present value of these obligations is as follows:

At 1 January
Current service cost Interest cost Effects of changes in demographic assumptions Effects of changes in financial assumptions Experience adjustments Benefits paid Curtailments/settlements Changes in the scope of consolidation (1) Transfer to/from liabilities associated with

2017 100% 100%

At 31 December 2018 (as at 31 December 2017), all the assets related to guaranteed interest rate group insurance policies and profit-sharing.

For obligations financed through insurance contracts, the entity is not exposed to unusual market risks and it does not need to apply asset-liability matching strategies or longevity swaps. For the other obligations, the Group does not have any asset-liability matching strategies, as there are no plan assets. Similarly, there are no transferable financial instruments held as plan assets or plan assets that are property occupied by the entity.

The Group does not have any responsibilities for the governance of the plans, apart from participating in the negotiation of collective agreements that determine the benefits to be paid and in the settlement of the required contributions.

The actuarial assumptions (demographic and financial) used are the best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits.

231

The main actuarial assumptions used at the reporting date are as follows:

Discount rate (based on type of obligation and currency) Percentage salary increase (based on type of obligation and
currency) Pension obligations in Spain:
Mortality tables Disability tables Pension obligations in France: Mortality tables Disability tables Pension obligations in Italy: Mortality tables Disability tables

The discount rate used was determined on the basis of the "iboxx AA" corporate bond rate curve at 31 December 2018, depending on the duration of the obligations (as in 2017).

It should also be noted that for the main defined benefit plans the estimated sensitivity of the obligation recorded at year-end to a 50 bp change (in the variables shown below) would be:

Discount rate Percentage salary increase

2018 4.9% - 4.6% 3.4% - 3.6%

2017 4.1% - 3.1% 3.3% - 3.6%

There were no changes in the methods and assumptions used for the sensitivity analysis with respect to the preceding year. The method used to perform the sensitivity analysis was the "projected unit credit" method, changing each assumption while keeping the others constant.
The contributions expected to be made in 2019 amount to EUR 65 million (EUR 68 million estimated at the end of 2017 for 2018).
Lastly, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at year-end is 10.6 years (2017 year-end: 11.3 years).

232

b) Other obligations
Together with the aforementioned obligations, several Group companies have long-term obligations to their employees in the form of incentives to attain the business targets established in the 2018-2020 Plan, length of service bonuses and vacation pay, also regulated in the collective agreements, after a given number of years of uninterrupted service and other requirements have been achieved. With regard to the measurement of these obligations, a liability totalling EUR 15,455 thousand (2017: EUR 36,316 thousand) is included under this heading in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current liability recognised in this connection amounts to EUR 13,250 thousand (2017: EUR 9,276 thousand).
The change in these obligations includes mainly, on the one hand, the provision for the corresponding portion of the obligation associated with the "2018-2020 Incentive Plan" and, on the other, the settlement in the year of the "2015-2017 Incentive Plan" (see Note 26-a).
The staff costs recognised in 2018 in relation to these obligations amounted to EUR 7,790 thousand (2017: EUR 3,744 thousand) (see Note 22-c).

It should be noted in relation to the obligations assumed by the Group to employees as a result of employment termination plans that at 31 December 2018 provisions had been recognised amounting to EUR 117 million (31 December 2017: EUR 88 million) in connection with the various toll road modernisation plans in progress (primarily in Spain and France) associated with the various efficiency plans implemented by the Group, and to meet the future employee benefit obligations associated with the end of certain concessions.

(1) The additions in 2017 under "Changes in the Scope of Consolidation and Business Combinations" relate to the impact of the obtainment of control of TTPL and JEPL; on the other hand, the decreases under "Changes in the Scope of Consolidation and Business Combinations" relate to the impact associated with the sale in July 2017 of the investee Infracom.
(2) Net transfers in 2017 amounting to EUR -125,279 thousand relating to fees and contributions to "Non-Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" and "Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities".

The exchange differences that arose in 2018 were due mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Argentine peso and the US dollar (2017: due mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of those currencies).

a) Provisions required under IFRIC 12
"Provisions Required under IFRIC 12" relates to the provision associated with future work, essentially road surfaces (in concessions accounted for using the intangible asset or bifurcated model), that the Group's concession operators are required to carry out as a result of the use of the infrastructure in order to maintain and restore it.

235

These provisions are recognised on the basis of the best estimate of future disbursements required to carry out the next cycle of work on the infrastructure, with the provisions being systematically recognised during each cycle with a charge to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on the basis of the usage of the infrastructure (with an average duration at each of the concessions of between seven and ten years) until the work is actually carried out. These future disbursements are estimated on the basis of technical studies, the quantification of which is subject, inter alia, to the condition of the infrastructure when the work is performed and to fluctuations in construction service price indexes. Consequently, the annual cash outflows associated with these provisions vary according to the duration of each work cycle, and it is estimated that provisions of approximately EUR 217 million will be used in 2019 (EUR 198 million estimated at 2017 year-end to be used in 2018).
b) Other provisions
The other long-term provisions at 31 December 2018 (as at 31 December 2017) include mainly:
· Provisions, estimated in the same manner as the provision described above, for replacement or substitution as a result of the expiry of the various concessions. Consequently, the cash outflows arising in this connection are tied to the work to be carried out at the end of each of the Group's concessions and, therefore, such outflows are not expected to be significant in the coming years.
· The provision in relation to the possible liabilities associated with the obligations acquired vis-à-vis the creditors of Alazor (see Note 10.i), the balance of which at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 228 million following the refund in 2017 of the amounts executed in 2016 (31 December 2017: also EUR 228 million). In connection with this provision, the amount and timing of the disbursement ultimately made will depend on the outcome of any processes that may arise as a result of the guarantees given.

"Non-Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" includes mainly:
· The amount payable by Invin to its non-controlling shareholder (EUR 188 million at 31 December 2018 compared with EUR 192 million at 31 December 2017) in relation to the financing granted to it by the shareholders of the consolidated company.
· The revised value of the contributions that the toll road concession operators in the Hit/Sanef subgroup must make to the French Government pursuant to the agreements entered into within the framework of the "Plan Relance" for French toll roads (EUR 112 million at 31 December 2018 and EUR 123 million at 31 December 2017 classified under "Other Long-Term Provisions" (see "Transfers" relating to changes in "Other Provisions" detailed above)).
· The amount payable by Aulesa to the Spanish Government (EUR 44 million at both 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017) by virtue of the participating loans granted by it.
· The amount payable by Túnels to the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government, the present value of which at 31 December 2018 was EUR 53 million (31 December 2017: EUR 50 million) in relation, on the one hand, to the fee of EUR 120 million payable at the end of the concession term (December 2037) and, on the other, the additional fee (also payable in 2037) recognised in 2013 and 2014 as a result, as established in the concession arrangement, of net toll revenue in said years exceeding the projections in the Economic and Financial Plan.
· The balance payable to the Government by the subsidiary Acesa as a result of the obligation acquired under the merger agreement with the previous operator of the concession for the Montmeló-El Papiol stretch of the related toll road (EUR 20,973 thousand at 31 December 2018 and 2017).
· It also includes payables to non-current asset suppliers amounting to EUR 7,344 thousand (2017: EUR 8,590 thousand).
237

Likewise, at 31 December 2018, it included in "Other liabilities ­ Cuurent" the investment commitment of Sol, recognised at its present value (EUR 150 million), for the performance of construction work as detailed in Note 9.ii
Also, it should be noted that at 31 December 2017, "Non-Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" included the following payment obligations that are included in "Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" at 31 December 2018 on the basis of their maturities:
· A liability for the acquisition in 2014 of all the shares of Infraestructuras Americanas, S.L.U. (IA, merged with Invin since 2017) for EUR 295 million payable in August 2019 (EUR 290 million at 31 December 2018 and EUR 282 million at 31 December 2017 at the net present values at the respective reporting dates).
· The amount payable by Via Paulista to Agencia de Transporte do Estado de São Paulo (ARTESP), the value of which at 31 December 2018 was EUR 56 million (31 December 2017: EUR 60 million), in relation to the fee of BRL 249 million (31 December 2017: BRL 239 million) payable in 2019, in accordance with the concession arrangement of the Rodovias dos Calçados toll road granted in 2017.
In addition, it should be noted that at 31 December 2017 the Group had two liabilities related to share purchase commitments, which were executed in the first half of 2018. Specifically:
· A liability of EUR 302 million for the commitment to purchase Hispasat shares (33.69%) from third-party shareholders of the latter, whose interests in this consolidated company were reflected at 31 December 2017 under "Non-Controlling Interests". In this connection, on 18 April 2018, following the execution of the right of first refusal of the other shareholders, the acquisition from Eutelsat, S.A. of a final amount of 32.63% of the share capital of Hispasat for EUR 293 million was completed (see Notes 2-h and 14-c).
· A liability of EUR 14 million for the commitment to purchase JEPL shares (26.00%) from third-party shareholders of the latter, whose interests in this consolidated company were reflected at 31 December 2017 under "Non-Controlling Interests". This purchase commitment was executed on 27 March 2018 with the acquisition from the funds Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte. Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust of 26% of the share capital of JEPL for EUR 15 million (see Notes 2-h and 14-c).

5,108,416

(*) Breakdown of "Services" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2017 considering the adoption for comparison purposes, pursuant to IAS 1, of the changes in certain presentation criteria in the financial statements detailed in Note 5-b.
(1) Including, in the case of Chilean companies, the toll road revenue net of the estimated amount recognised that foreseeably will not be collected due to doubtful debts (CLP -21,655,697 thousand in 2018 compared with CLP -29,111,484 thousand in 2017 corresponding to Autopista Central in Chile, equal to EUR -28,557 thousand and EUR -39,720 thousand, respectively).

The toll road revenue in 2018 was boosted mainly by the increase in traffic in the various countries in which the Group operates, as well as the toll increases at the various concessions. However, all of this was substantially offset by the exchange losses incurred in the reporting period as a result of the depreciation of the average exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Argentine peso and US dollar at 31 December 2018.
"Other Services" was adversely affected by the impact on the scope of consolidation associated with the sale of Infracom in July 2017.

239

b) Other operating income and other income
"Other Operating Income" includes income from the assignment of the operation of the service areas and the telematic services of certain toll road concession operators, indemnity payment collections, etc.
Substantially all of "Other Income" at 31 December 2018 relates to the net impact of the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession arrangements until December 2030 (see Notes 13-i-h and 27-c). "Other Income" also includes the gain on the disposal of property, plant and equipment.

c) Staff costs

7,699 3,855 3,744 71,451 636,886

The decrease in "Staff Costs" arose mainly due to the exchange losses incurred in the reporting period as a result of the depreciation of the average exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Argentine peso and US dollar at 31 December 2018.

241

Also, it should be noted that the shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 10 December 2018 set the number of members of Abertis's Board of Directors at five. At 31 December 2018, the aforementioned Board of Directors consisted of five members, with all the seats on the Board occupied.

23. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS

i) Contingencies
The detail of the Group's guarantees to third parties provided by banks, which are not expected to give rise to significant costs, is as follows:

31 December
2017

For operating obligations and commitments For other obligations and commitments (1)

410,846 315,815 726,661

307,345 194,518 501,863

(1) Basically for obligations and commitments associated with investments and financing, etc.

The increase in the year is explained mainly, on the one hand, by the impact of the provision by Vias Chile of guarantees to third parties in relation to certain Autopista Central credit notes (CLP 90,687,111 thousand, approximately EUR 114 million at 31 December 2018) and, on the other hand, by the provision of new guarantees by Gco (ARP 3,221,979 thousand, approximately EUR 75 million at 31 December 2018).
As at 2017 year-end, the subsidiary Aumar has undertaken to provide guarantees for its investee Ciralsa amounting to EUR 4,987 thousand; a provision was recognised in this connection in 2015. Also, Abertis has undertaken to provide guarantees for its subsidiary Aulesa amounting to EUR 29 million in relation to a financing agreement entered into by the latter (2017: EUR 28 million). In addition, Abertis guarantees the settlement of derivatives arranged by Abertis India, the fair value of which at 31 December 2018 amounted to an asset of EUR 9,736 thousand (31 December 2017: an asset of EUR 4,854 thousand).
Likewise, Abertis provides guarantees in relation to the exploitation agreements signed by the company Emovis for EUR 46,922 thousand (2017: EUR 49,687 thousand) and by the company Eurotoll for EUR 5,034 thousand (2017: EUR 5,035 thousand).

245

In addition, the financing agreements of the associate Alazor include the commitment of its shareholders to make additional contributions in the event that certain events relating to the achievement of financial ratios should occur and in order to service debts and cover certain additional costs for which financing is not available. Provisions were recognised in prior years for the best estimate of all the possible liabilities associated with these commitments assumed and guarantees provided (see Note 10.i). Lastly, it should be noted that at 31 December 2018 the concession operators in the Arteris subgroup that were granted concessions by the Brazilian Government have in progress with the grantor certain notices and/or other negotiations, relating primarily to these companies' normal liability within the framework of the bidding for, and performance and termination of their concession arrangements, for a total combined amount of BRL 981 million (2017 year-end: BRL 838 million, equal, at the end of the respective periods, to approximately EUR 221 million and EUR 215 million, respectively), as well as other various legal proceedings, the unfavourable resolution of which to the interests of the Group is deemed possible, totalling BRL 57 million (2017 year-end: BRL 48 million, equal to approximately EUR 13 million and EUR 12 million at the end of the respective reporting periods), and it is considered that they will not give rise to other liabilities at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements that might give rise to material cash outflows other than those described in Note 20. The contingencies detailed in Note 19 in relation to potential tax contingencies that might arise should also be taken into consideration.
246

ii) Commitments and obligations In addition to the property, plant and equipment, intangible asset investment commitments and concession arrangements ­ financial asset model indicated in Notes 8, 9 and 13, respectively, at 31 December 2018 the Group had the following commitments and obligations:
· As part of the agreement with the French Government for the "Plan Relance" for French toll roads, the shareholders of the French concession operators resolved to create a fund to develop infrastructure of a clearly environmental nature ("Fonds de Modernisation Ecologique des Transports", FMET). The contribution of Abertis as the sole shareholder of the French subgroup Hit/Sanef is estimated at around EUR 52 million, which will be paid as the various investment projects to be carried out are approved. In the year ended 31 December 2018, contributions of EUR 2,725 thousand were made in this connection (2017 year-end: EUR 1,375 thousand).
Also, at 2017 year-end, in addition to the aforementioned commitment, the Group had recognised, on the one hand, the commitments to purchase shares of Hispasat and JEPL, which were honoured in 2018 (see Note 2-h) and, on the other, various agreements with certain with the non-controlling shareholders of A4 (Provincia di Verona and Provincia di Vicenza) to acquire an additional 6.47% of its share capital (up to 90.03%) for EUR 34 million, which were completed in January 2018 (see Note 2-h).
247

24. INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT It is Group policy to pay maximum attention to environmental protection and conservation activities, and each investee adopts measures to minimise the environmental impact of the infrastructure that it manages in order to ensure the maximum degree of environmental integration of the infrastructure in their respective geographical areas. In 2018 the Group's expenditure on improving the environment amounted to EUR 23,256 thousand (2017: EUR 22,609 thousand), mainly through the following actions:
· Cleaning, landscaping and clearing along the toll roads, as well as upgrades to the service and rest areas and work to reduce visual and acoustic impact.
· Collection and removal of hazardous urban waste. · Aquifer resource protection plans (especially in the framework of the
"Plan Relance" agreement reached with the French government for the modernisation of the toll road network). · Environmental impact studies, mainly in relation to the work to expand the capacity of the toll roads in Brazil. · To a lesser extent, implementation of measures to optimise water management and energy consumption and reduce noise pollution.
248

25. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group's various activities are organised and managed separately based on the nature of the infrastructure managed, with each operating segment constituting a strategic business unit that manages different types of infrastructure in different markets. Consequently, the Group's decisionmaking bodies base their decision making on information broken down by operating segment.
Management has defined an operating segment as a group of assets and operations used for managing infrastructure subject to risks and rewards that are distinct from those managed by other business segments. The main factors considered in identifying operating segments are the nature of the infrastructure managed and the operations carried on. Consequently, the Group organises its management into the following operating segments:
· Toll roads: construction, maintenance and operation of toll roads under concession arrangements; management of toll road concessions in Spain and abroad; construction of road infrastructure and activities complementary to toll road construction, maintenance and operation. It should be noted that Abertis manages its toll roads by dividing its operations into the following operating segments: toll roads in Spain, toll roads in France, toll roads in Italy, toll roads in Brazil, toll roads in Chile, toll roads in Puerto Rico, toll roads in Argentina and toll roads in the rest of the world.
· Other: relates mainly to the activity carried on by the Parent (holding shares of the Group companies and managing those companies) and other companies that provide financing to Group companies.
The operating segments reported on obtain their revenue on the basis of the nature of the service provided, as described in Note 3-o, and their customers are the end users of the toll road infrastructure.
The directors, who constitute the Group's highest operating decision-making authority, analyse the results of each segment, down to the profit or loss from operations, given that this is the item from which operating expense and revenue can be directly attributed to, or reasonably distributed among, the segments.

(1) The loss of the Other operating segment relates to the 34% ownership interest held in Cellnex. (2) Including mainly the interest income and expenses on borrowings, which are mostly managed by corporate central services, and the financial impact of the application of IFRIC 12. (3) Including the ten-month contribution of TTPL and JEPL, after the acquisition by Abertis of 100% and 74%, respectively, of their share capital in March 2017.

251

The increase in the operating figures of the Toll roads operating segment was due mainly to (i) the impact, net of the related tax of EUR 78 million, of the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession arrangements until December 2030 (with an impact on the Toll roads Argentina operating segment, see Note 13.i.h); (ii) the increase in traffic in the various countries in which the Group operates; and (iii) the toll increases at the various concessions. These impacts were partially offset by (i) the impact of the sale of Infracom in July 2017 (with an impact on the Toll roads Italy operating segment); (ii) the expiry of the concession arrangement for the Via Norte toll road in May 2018 (with an impact on the Toll roads Brazil operating segment); and (iii) the impact of the depreciation of the average exchange rate at the end of December 2018 of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the US dollar and the Argentine peso, affecting negatively the figures of the Toll roads Brazil, Toll roads Chile, Toll roads Puerto Rico and Toll roads Argentina operating segments, respectively (in the latter case without taking into account the recognition of the outstanding measures described above to restore the economic and financial balance). The detail of the assets and liabilities of the segments at 31 December 2018 and 2017 and of the investments in non-current assets made in each year is as follows:

The changes in the balance sheet figures of the "Toll roads" segment were due mainly to the impact of the depreciation at the reporting date of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso, and to the appreciation at the reporting date of the US dollar. The increase in the "Toll roads Argentina" segment was due mainly to the impact of the recognition of the extension of the concession arrangements of Ausol and Gco (see Note 13.i-h). In addition, the change in the "Other" segment was due mainly to the impact of the exercise of the purchase commitments of non-controlling interests of Hispasat and the sale of 34% of the share capital of Cellnex (see Note 2-h). Also, it should be noted that there were no significant inter-segment transactions in 2018 or 2017. The segment assets include primarily property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial assets arising from the application of the bifurcated model and the financial asset model under IFRIC 12, inventories, accounts receivable, cash from operations and deferred tax assets. The segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and the bank borrowings arranged to carry on operations. The investments in non-current assets comprise additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, as well as financial assets accounted for under IFRIC 12 using the bifurcated and financial asset models.
254

26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
a) Directors and senior executives
The annual remuneration of the directors for their conduct of business as members of the Board of Directors of the Parent is fixed as a share of the net profit. It may only be received when the transfers to reserves and the minimum dividend payment established by law have been covered and under no circumstance may it, in aggregate, exceed 2% of the profit for the year. The Board of Directors may distribute this share of the net profit among its members in the manner and proportions it deems appropriate.
In 2018, mainly in the framework of the Group's change of shareholders detailed in Note 15-a, changes were made to the composition of the Board of Directors, effective 18 May 2018, which affect the comparability of the figures.
The remuneration received by the directors of Abertis in 2018, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of 3 April 2017, was as follows:
i. The serving and former members of the Board of Directors, for discharging the duties inherent to their status as directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., earned EUR 2,303 thousand (2017: EUR 2,595 thousand), and earned EUR 134 thousand as members of the Boards of Directors of other Group companies (2017: EUR 251 thousand).
ii. For performing senior management duties, the directors with executive functions (until 6 February 2018 the former CEO and from that date onwards the new Chief Executive-General Manager, who was appointed as the CEO on 10 December 2018) earned EUR 1,449 thousand (2017: EUR 2,486 thousand), corresponding to their annual fixed and variable remuneration received, and EUR 249 thousand (2017: EUR 660 thousand) in contributions arising from employee benefit obligations. Also, in the first quarter of 2018 EUR 8,250 thousand were paid to the former CEO as a result of his attaining the multi-year targets established in the 2015-2017 Incentive Plan as a contribution to the employee welfare plan of which he was a beneficiary.
255

iii. In addition, the serving and former directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. earned, EUR 52 thousand (2017: EUR 64 thousand) as other remuneration in kind in relation to life and medical insurance policies.
The remuneration in 2018 of the senior executives, understood to be the general managers and similar employees of the Abertis Group who in that year carried out management duties while reporting directly to the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, the Chairman or the CEO of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., totalled EUR 5,483 thousand (2017: EUR 6,509 thousand). It should also be noted that in the first quarter of 2018 the senior executives received EUR 10,673 thousand for achieving the multiyear targets established in the 2015-2017 Incentive Plan.
Also, the senior executives earned as other benefits contributions related to social welfare obligations and other remuneration in kind amounting to EUR 453 thousand and EUR 361 thousand, respectively (2017: EUR 596 thousand and EUR 315 thousand, respectively).
The post-employment benefits received by former senior executives totalled EUR 21 thousand in 2018 (2017: EUR 36 thousand).
Also, in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy for 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Group has in place a new multi-year incentive plan named "ILP 2018-2020", tied to the degree of attainment of the targets in the Group's three-year plan for 2018-2020.

b) Significant shareholders
A significant shareholder is defined as a shareholder that has significant influence over the Parent (see Note 15-a).
In this connection, it should be noted that:
· On the one hand, on 17 May 2018, with the settlement of the tender offer in which Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. had been involved since 2017 (completed on 8 May 2018), a change of control took place at Abertis whereby CriteriaCaixa ceased to be a significant shareholder of Abertis and Hochtief, A.G. became a significant shareholder. In this regard, it should be noted that, as a result of the agreement for a joint investment in Abertis entered into by Hochtief, Atlantia and ACS, once the agreement was formalised on 29 October 2018, both Atlantia and ACS became significant shareholders of Abertis, and Atlantia is also the new majority shareholder (see Note 15-a). Therefore, following the various changes of control of Abertis that took place in the year, at 31 December 2018 Abertis had as following significant shareholders Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief, as it is described in Note 15-a.
· On the other hand, on 26 September 2017 there was a change of control at CaixaBank (a company with which Abertis has balances and performs transactions) and, as a result, CriteriaCaixa, which at that date was a significant shareholder of Abertis, no longer exercised either control or a significant influence over CaixaBank. Therefore, from that date onwards, CaixaBank was no longer considered to be an entity related to Abertis. However, in accordance with the disclosures required by IAS 34, for comparative purposes a detail is provided of the transactions performed with CaixaBank until 26 September 2017. Also, at 31 December 2018 (as at 31 December 2017): Abertis has no balances with the former related entity "la Caixa" in relation to: (i) bond issues, loans and credit lines received; (ii) financial swaps arranged; (iii) financing of retirement obligations; (iv) assets purchased and services received; (v) obligations and contingencies; and (vi) other items.
In addition to the dividends paid to shareholders (in this case, to the former significant shareholder CriteriaCaixa), the breakdown of the balances and transactions with significant shareholders (in the respective periods in which they were significant shareholders) is as follows:
257

i) Bond issues, loans and credit lines received At 31 December 2018, as at 31 December 2017, the Group had not issued any bonds and had not arranged any loans or guarantee lines with related entities. In the year ended 31 December 2018 no finance income received from or finance costs paid to related entities were recognised (in 2017: EUR 3,657 thousand and EUR -17,385 thousand, respectively, from and to the former related entity "la Caixa", through CaixaBank).
ii) Financial swaps arranged At 31 December 2018, as at 31 December 2017, the Group had not arranged any financial swaps with related banks relating to foreign currency and/or interest rate hedges.
iii) Financing of retirement obligations In the year ended 31 December 2018 (as in 2017), the Group did not make any contributions to insurance policies that it may have arranged with any related entity in order to meet the defined benefit obligations to the Group's employees. Also, at 31 December 2018 and 2017 no plan assets associated with such policies were held.

Also, there are balances payable to and receivable from related parties relating to services received amounting to EUR 3,415 thousand and EUR 43,120 thousand, respectively (in the latter case relating mainly to the account receivable of the concession operator A4 from Autostrade per l'Italia, S.p.A. in connection with toll collection management relating to the interconnection between the A4 toll road with those of other concession operators).

v) Obligations and contingencies
At 31 December 2018, as at 31 December 2017, the Group had not arranged any credit lines, loans or guarantee lines with related entities.

vi) Other items
It should also be noted that, as indicated in Note 7.ii, on 12 July 2018, Abertis sold shares representing the remaining 29.9% of the share capital of Cellnex (69,273,289 shares) to the Italian company ConnecT S.p.A. (Connect, a subsidiary of Edizione S.r.l.) for EUR 1,489,376 thousand (i.e., EUR 21.50 per share).

259

In addition, in connection with the acquisition in 2016 of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) with deferred payment of EUR 589 million payable in February 2023, as indicated in Note 16.iii, the seller has factored the receivables from Abertis to a syndicate of banks (with Abertis as a party to the arrangement), including the former related entity "la Caixa" (a related entity until 26 September 2017), to which EUR 100 million of the total EUR 589 million indicated will have to be paid in February 2023.
c) Associates and joint ventures The most significant transactions with associates and joint ventures relate to accrued dividends (EUR 328 thousand and EUR 6,112 thousand, respectively, in 2018 -collected in full in 2018-, and EUR 7,050 thousand and EUR 5,540 thousand in 2017 -collected in full in 2017- see Note 10). The balances with these companies at the end of 2018 and 2017 are detailed in Notes 13.ii and 16.ii.
d) Other disclosures concerning the Board of Directors Pursuant to Article 229 of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, the directors have not reported any direct or indirect conflict of interest that they (or any persons related to them) might have with the Parent's interests.

Translation of a report issued in Spanish. In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.
ABERTIS INFRAESTRUCTURAS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
CONSOLIDATED DIRECTORS' REPORT FOR 2018
1. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE 262 OF THE SPANISH LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES LAW
1.1. Situation of the entity
Abertis in 2018
Abertis is one of the world's leading toll road management groups, with more than 8,200 km of high-capacity, quality roads in 15 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, of which close to 7,800 kilometres are managed directly.
Abertis is the leading toll road operator in countries such as Spain, Chile and Brazil, and has a notable and significant presence in France, Italy, Puerto Rico and Argentina. The Group also has interests in the management of more than 200 km of roads in France, the UK and Colombia.
Thanks to the internationalisation strategy implemented by the Group in recent years, more than 70% of Abertis's revenue now comes from outside Spain, with France, Italy, Brazil and Chile being particularly important.
For Abertis, driver safety is a priority. The Group continuously invests in technology and intelligent engineering to ensure that its customers experience a safe, comfortable, fast and easy journey when they choose the Group's motorways.
Committed to research and innovation, Abertis combines advances in highcapacity infrastructure with new technologies to drive innovative solutions to meet the mobility challenges of the future.
288

Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is the Parent of a Group in which in some cases it is the sole shareholder and in others it is the majority shareholder of the companies heading the various lines of business and geographical markets in which the Group operates. The structure of the Abertis Group at 31 December 2018 is summarised as follows:
The detail of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at 31 December 2018 and of the percentages of ownership is shown in Appendices I, II and III, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. It should also be noted that since 29 October 2018 Abertis and the other Group companies have formed part of the Atlantia Group, the parent of which is Atlantia, S.p.A. (with registered office at Via Antonio Nibby, 20, Rome, Italy), which, in turn, belongs to the group headed by Edizione, S.r.l. (with registered office at Piaza del Duomo 19, Treviso, Italy). The Abertis Group provides services in the area of infrastructure management serving mobility and communications and, in accordance with its strategy, focuses its activities and growth on the toll roads industry. It should be noted in this connection that:
289

· In 2018 Abertis sold its 34% ownership interest in Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex) for EUR 1,703 million, giving rise to a consolidated capital gain of EUR 605 million.
· Also, at the end of 2017 Abertis decided to discontinue the satellite telecommunications business carried on by the part of the Group of which the parent is Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat) and, therefore, at 31 December 2018 the assets and liabilities associated with the aforementioned subgroup, which had not yet been disposed of at that date, are presented as discontinued operations and the results of the subgroup are presented as profit or loss from discontinued operations. In this connection, it should be noted that, as indicated in Note 7.i, on 12 February 2019 Abertis reached an agreement for the sale of Hispasat.

Strategic approach
Having more than satisfactorily fulfilled the 2015-17 Strategic Plan, in 2018 the Group continued to develop its operations based on the following main pillars: (i) promoting international growth; (ii) focusing on key areas; (iii) seeking efficiencies; and (iv) shareholder returns.
i) Promoting growth
Abertis analyses all growth projects with strict financial discipline, from the perspective of the industrial role that characterises the Group. In this regard, only those projects that do not jeopardise either the Group's dividend policy or its financial strength are undertaken.
Abertis drives growth through three lines of action: growth based on existing assets; new acquisitions; and public-private partnerships. In this regard, in 2018 the Group invested around EUR 950 million and has major investments planned for 2018-2020.
Growth in the existing asset base
In 2018 Abertis acquired an additional 6.47% of the share capital of the Italian company A4 Holding (A4) for EUR 33 million. With this transaction, Abertis completed the various agreements reached in 2017 to acquire various non-controlling interests in its subsidiary A4 (which, in turn, owns all the shares of the concession operator of the A4 and A31 toll roads) to push its ownership interest up to just over 90%, which entailed an investment of EUR 212 million between 2017 and 2018.
292

Also in 2018, Abertis acquired for EUR 15 million an additional 26% of the Indian concession operator Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL), which holds the NH-44 toll road concession in the state of Telengana. With this transaction, Abertis obtained all of the shares of JEPL, thereby reinforcing its commitment to the Indian market.
Through these transactions Abertis has made progress towards implementing its strategy to achieve a greater balance in its global portfolio by growing in economies with stable legislative frameworks for concessions and a clear commitment to public-private partnerships in the toll road sector.
Lastly, it should be noted that, during 2018, the purchase commitment on Hispasat shares has been completed, through which an additional 32.63% of its share capital has been acquired for EUR 293 million.
Public-private partnership agreements
The following agreements were of particular note in 2018:
· In March Sol, an Abertis group subsidiary in Chile, entered into an agreement with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works to make new investments in the Autopista del Sol (Ruta 78) toll road, in exchange for the extension of the current arrangement, which expires in May 2019, until March 2021. The new investments, which will amount to around EUR 105 million, consist of the widening of the road through the construction of a third lane between the cities of Santiago de Chile and Talagante, in addition to other complementary works. The extensive investment plan along the entire toll road will make it possible to solve the problems arising from the increase in traffic in recent years, as well as to improve congestion and road safety. The construction work will foreseeably be competed in 2020. In exchange, the concession period for Autopista del Sol was extended by 22 months until 2021. Autopista del Sol is the main road connection between the city of Santiago de Chile and the seaport of San Antonio, the largest in the country with an area of influence that extends from central Chile to the province of Mendoza in Argentina.
293

· Also, in July Gco and Ausol, subsidiaries of the Abertis group in Argentina, entered into agreements with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to carry out new investments in the respective concession operators for a total amount of USD 680 million (approximately EUR 594 million at 2018 year-end), in exchange for the extension of their respective current concession arrangements, which were to expire in December 2018 and 2020, respectively, until December 2030. These investments will be financed with the future revenue from these concessions as a result of the extension of the expiry dates of the current arrangements until 2030. In addition, these agreements involve the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of Gco and Ausol for estimated amounts of USD 247 million and USD 499 million, respectively (approximately EUR 215 million and EUR 435 million), a more favourable toll review scheme and the cessation of proceedings between the parties.
· It should also be noted that on 24 July 2018, the memorandum of understanding entered into in January 2017 by Sanef and the French Government for the implementation of a new investment plan for the modernisation of its network was completed, whereby Sanef will invest EUR 122 million in various projects in exchange for an additional annual toll increase for 2019-2021 (0.225% for Sanef and 0.218% for Sapn).
Abertis thus continues to reinforce its commitment to public-private partnerships with a view to achieving solutions to create future value for the regions, through agreements with governments for new investments in exchange for extending the term of the concessions or through toll increases.
In this regard, Abertis continues to work to reach new and important agreements in most of the countries in which it operates, such as Spain, France, Italy, Brazil, Chile, Puerto Rico and Argentina, thus consolidating the Group's capacity to grow its portfolio of existing assets, increasing the average duration of its concessions through cooperation initiatives with local authorities that are advantageous for both parties.
294

ii) Focusing on key areas Abertis has focused its business on the toll road industry, which at 2018 year-end (as at 2017 year-end) accounted for all of its revenue. This process was substantially completed at the end of 2017 when Abertis began the process of selling Hispasat's operations, discontinuing the satellite telecommunications business. This process is expected to be completed early in 2019 following the agreement for the sale of Hispasat entered into on 12 February 2019. In 2018, in line with this objective, Abertis disposed of the 34.0% of Cellnex, giving rise to a consolidated gain of EUR 605 million, thereby completing the process of focusing solely on the toll road industry.
iii) Efficiencies After completing the three-year efficiency plan for 2015-2017 (focused on the Group's businesses in France, Brazil and Spain) with cumulative savings of EUR 416 million, the Group intends to continue advancing in the endeavours made in recent years, not only at Corporate, but also at the various business units, with the aim of consolidating and improving the Ebitda margin of each of the Group's business units.
iv) Shareholder returns On 13 March 2018, the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Abertis resolved to pay a second and final dividend with a charge to unrestricted voluntary reserves of EUR 0.40 gross per share, which was paid in March 2018. Accordingly, the total 2017 dividend amounted to EUR 0.80 gross per share, representing EUR 792.3 million and an increase of 10% with respect to the total dividend distributed for 2016.
295

On the other hand, the Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. have proposed to distribute a 2018 dividend charged to the income of the year for an amount of EUR 875,013 thousand, representing 0.96 gross euros per share, which represents an increase of 10.5% over the total dividend distributed in 2017.

The detail of the dividends paid in 2018, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

Shareholders: tender offers
As detailed in Note 15-a.i, 2018 was clearly marked by the completion of the tender offer in which Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. had been involved since 2017. In this regard, it should be noted that:

296

Atlantia tender offer · On 15 May 2017 the Italian company Atlantia, S.p.A. (Atlantia)
announced its decision to launch a tender offer for all of the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., the terms and conditions of which were described in the prospectus authorised by the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) on 9 October 2017. Atlantia, which made the effectiveness of its tender offer conditional upon the acquisition of a minimum stake of 50% plus one share in Abertis, offered an alternative to the shareholders of Abertis (at their choice) of either a cash consideration of EUR 16.50 per Abertis share, or consideration of special shares of Atlantia based on an exchange ratio calculation which foresaw that for each share of Abertis that accepted the offer, 0.697 special shares of Atlantia would be delivered (subject to the holders of a minimum of 100,000,000 and a maximum of 230,000,000 shares of Abertis opting for the aforementioned exchange) or a combination of the two. In this regard, on 18 October 2017 the Board of Directors of Abertis issued a detailed and reasoned report on the tender offer of Atlantia in which it stated that it considered the offer to be positive and attractive from the industrial standpoint and the amount of the consideration in cash to be reasonable on the basis of a fundamental analysis of Abertis, although it also stated that it considered that there was room for improvement in the cash offered.
297

Hochtief tender offer
· On 18 October 2017, the German company Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) presented a rival offer also for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., upon which the acceptance period for the aforementioned tender offer launched by Atlantia was suspended. According to the terms and conditions of this tender offer detailed in the prospectus authorised by the CNMV on 12 March 2018, once considered the adjustment of the dividend paid by Abertis previously the completion of tender offer, Hochtief, which also made its tender offer conditional on its acquiring a minimum of 50% plus one share of the shares of Abertis and was also offering the shareholders of Abertis the alternative (at their choice) of either a cash consideration of EUR 18.36 per share of Abertis or a consideration of ordinary shares of Hochtief based on an exchange ratio of 0.1254 ordinary shares of Hochtief for every share of Abertis , albeit only 193,530,179 shares of Abertis (maximum and minimum Hochtief share acceptances that Hochtief would allow and, therefore, should the holders of more than 193,530,179 shares of Abertis opt for shares of Hochtief, the shares would be apportioned on a pro rata basis, and should the acceptance be lower, Hochtief would be entitled to withdraw its offer), or a combination of the two. Also, Hochtief announced its intention to exercise its squeeze-out right if it achieved the legally required acceptance threshold and, if the threshold were not reached, its intention to exclude the shares of Abertis from trading. In this connection, the Board of Directors of Abertis also had to draft a detailed and reasoned report on the tender offer of Hochtief explaining, among other matters, its opinion regarding the pros and cons of the offer and the reasonableness of the price offered by Hochtief, although the report was ultimately prepared in connection with Hochtief's modified tender offer, as detailed below.
298

Modification of the Hochtief tender offer and withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer
· On 14 March 2018, Hochtief announced changes to its tender offer, having reached a binding agreement in principle with Atlantia and Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) to make a joint investment in Abertis. The agreement entered into was structured on the basis of the following principles:
i. Change to Hochtief's tender offer In relation to the competing voluntary tender offer for the shares of Abertis launched by Hochtief as detailed above, Hochtief changed its offer so that it was paid in full in cash, maintaining the price of the cash consideration unchanged at EUR 18.36 for each share of Abertis.
ii. Holding company Atlantia, ACS y Hochtief would contribute capital of approximately EUR 7,000 million to a jointly owned holding company that would subsequently acquire from Hochtief its entire ownership interest in Abertis for the same price as that paid by Hochtief in the tender offer (adjusted by such gross dividends that Abertis might pay).
The share capital of this company would be owned as follows: (i) Atlantia 50% plus one share; (ii) ACS 30%; and (iii) Hochtief 20% minus one share. Also, the parties would enter into a shareholders agreement with a view to regulating their relationships as shareholders of the jointly owned holding company.
iii. Injection of capital and investment by Atlantia in Hochtief Hochtief would increase capital by approximately 6.34 million shares, which would be subscribed in full by ACS for EUR 143.04 per share. Also, ACS would sell for the same price to Atlantia shares of Hochtief for a total value of up to EUR 2,411 million.
iv.Strategic cooperation agreement Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief would enter into a long-term agreement with a view to maximising strategic relations and synergies between the parties and Abertis in new public-private partnerships in both projects at the tendering and construction phases and projects in the operating phase.
299

v. Withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer
On the basis of the aforementioned agreements, Atlantia would withdraw its tender offer for Abertis shares described above.
· On 19 March 2018, after the official publication of the first announcement of the initial tender offer for the shares of Abertis, the CNMV announced that the period for accepting, at that time, the two competing tender offers, would be extended from 20 March 2018 to 18 April 2018, inclusive.
· As a result of all of the above, on 12 April 2018, on the one hand, Atlantia, by virtue of the aforementioned agreements, withdrew its voluntary tender offer for Abertis described above and, on the other, the CNMV authorised Hochtief's voluntary tender offer for Abertis shares, which became the only surviving tender offer. Also, the CNMV extended the period for accepting the Hochtief tender offer until 8 May 2018, the date on which it was completed.
In this connection, on 17 April 2018 the Board of Directors of Abertis published a detailed and reasoned report on the modified tender offer of Hochtief stating that it considered the offer to be positive, highlighting that it deemed the amount of the cash consideration to be reasonable and included a share premium of 33% of the average Abertis share price in the six months preceding 13 April 2017.
· Lastly, on 14 May 2018 the CNMV published the result of the tender offer launched by Hochtief for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., which had been accepted by holders of 780,317,294 shares, i.e., 78.79% of its share capital (85.60% if the 78,815,937 treasury shares held by Abertis at that date were disregarded).
· Since the legally required threshold of acceptances to be able to exercise the aforementioned right of squeeze-out was not reached, Hochtief called for the exclusion from trading of the shares representing the entire share capital of Abertis. Therefore, in accordance with the requirements provided for in the applicable legislation to be able to delist the shares, Hochtief had previously made a good 'til cancelled share purchase order of EUR 18.36 per share for a maximum of 52,612,289 shares of Abertis representing 5.31% of its share capital. This good 'til cancelled share purchase order, which commenced on 21 June 2018, resulted in the acquisition of an additional stake of 3.06% in Abertis once it was completed on 27 July 2018.
300

Incorporation of Abertis HoldCo, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A. and transfer of the shares of Abertis to the latter
· Lastly, Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief, pursuant to the resolutions adopted described above, have contributed the shares of Abertis acquired as a result of the Hochtief tender offer to a jointly owned holding company with the following structure: 1.- Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief incorporated a Spanish company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., in which Atlantia has an ownership interest of 50% plus one share, ACS has an ownership interest of 30% and Hochtief has an ownership interest of 20% minus one share. Equity of EUR 6,758.8 million was contributed to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., and it currently has borrowings from the financing banks for a nominal amount of EUR 9,823.9 million. 2.- In turn, that company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., incorporated, as its sole shareholder, Abertis Participaciones, S.A., to which it contributed equity of EUR 16,519.6 million. 3.- Hochtief sold to Abertis Participaciones, S.A., for cash, its entire ownership interest in Abertis, representing 98.7% of its share capital, for the same price as it had paid in its acquisition, i.e., EUR 18.36 per share. This sale was completed on 29 October 2018, the date on which control of Abertis was therefore transferred to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., which is in turn controlled by Atlantia.
301

Shareholders: merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
As detailed in Note 15.i-a, on 1 December 2018 the Boards of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. formally prepared the merger balance sheet and the draft terms of merger of the two companies, with the aim of simplifying the corporate structure, facilitating the allocation of resources and achieving a reduction in costs. The planned merger will be carried out through the absorption of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., as the absorbed company, by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., as the absorbing company, with the dissolution without liquidation of the former and the transfer en bloc of its assets and liabilities to Abertis which will acquire by universal succession all the rights and obligations of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. As a result of the merger, the shares of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., all of which are owned by its sole shareholder, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., will be retired. Lastly, the merger by absorption of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., as the absorbing company, and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., as the absorbed company, was approved on 8 February 2019 by the shareholders at the General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and by the sole shareholder of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
Stock market performance and profitability
In the framework of the tender offer launched by it, Hochtief announced its intention to exercise its squeeze-out right if it achieved the legally required acceptance threshold and, if the threshold were not reached, its intention to delist the shares of Abertis.
Therefore, since the threshold of acceptances legally required to be able to exercise the aforementioned squeeze-out right vis-à-vis the shareholders that had not accepted the tender offer was not reached, Hochtief triggered the call by Abertis of an EGM for 25 July 2018 which approved the delisting of the shares representing the entire share capital of Abertis from the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges. The delisting from the four Stock Exchanges became effective on 6 August 2018.
302

Prior to that delisting, Abertis's shares were listed on the four Spanish stock exchanges (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid and Valencia) and traded on the Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System. Until 9 May 2018, Abertis was included in the selective Spanish Ibex 35 index, which groups together the 35 main listed companies, a position it held for 26 years.
During the months of 2018 in which Abertis's shares were listed, the performance of the share was clearly influenced by the aforementioned tender offer process (with joint investment between Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief) which offered a price of EUR 18.36 per share, so that it reached a maximum closing price on 1 February (EUR 19.64) coinciding with the alltime high adjusted by the scrip issues carried out and a minimum closing price on 17 May (EUR 18.155).
1.2. Corporate governance
The vision, mission and values of Abertis contribute to achieving the Parent's purpose and underlay its short-, medium- and long-term strategy.
The vision of Abertis is to be a leading global operator in infrastructure management serving mobility and communications.
The mission of Abertis is to sustainably and efficiently promote and manage infrastructure that contributes to the development of society in harmony with the well-being of its employees and long-term value creation for its shareholders.
Thus, Abertis has established the following values with a view to ensuring the integrity and sustainability of its operations:
· Leading on the basis of the principles of responsibility and trust in people.
· Finding solutions to develop infrastructure based on dialogue and cooperation with our stakeholders.
· Anticipating and adapting to the needs of our customers and users through innovation and continuous improvement.
· Promoting efficiency in our organisation based on a simple and pragmatic approach.
· Being transparent so that our thoroughness and credibility may be perceived.
303

Governance model
The structure of the governing bodies and the decision-making process constitute other strengths of the Group. This structure is described in detail in the annual corporate governance report (ACGR), which forms part of this directors' report.
The governance model is based on the Board of Directors and the various committees, and the top priorities are excellence in good governance, promoting corporate social responsibility and good corporate governance practices. In this regard, on December 10, 2018, the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. agreed to modify the Company's Bylaws to adapt them to the new social reality of the Group. Likewise, and as a consequence of the new shareholding structure of the Company, the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting agreed to modify the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company, establishing itself in article 23.c) of the Bylaws that the Board of Directors may constitute any specialized commissions that it deems appropriate and among which the Audit Committee and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee are expressly mentioned. As of December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors has not yet had the opportunity to set up the Committees of the Board of Directors, and is expected to do so in the coming months.
Following the successful completion, on 18 May 2018, of the aforementioned tender offer process, the Board of Directors of Abertis, in line with the recommendations of good corporate governance and with the provisions of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, approved several changes in order to adapt its composition to the resulting shareholder structure of Abertis, with the entry of ten new proprietary directors of Hochtief (owner, at the aforementioned date, of 78.79% of the shares of Abertis) and the removal of five proprietary directors of the former shareholder Criteria Caixa, S.A.U., including the then Chairman of Abertis, Salvador Alemany, who was replaced by Marcelino Fernández Verdes. Also, five independent directors resigned.
Lastly, with the consummation on 29 October 2018 of the joint investment in Abertis between Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief detailed above, the renewal of the Board of Directors of Abertis was completed. Thus, the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 10 December 2018 approved the appointment of José Aljaro, Carlo Bertazzo, Giovanni Castellucci, Marcelino Fernández Verdes and Pedro López Jiménez as directors of Abertis.
The Board has thus reduced the number of members to five.
304

1.3. Compliance and effective risk management
Ethics and compliance
Abertis is fully committed to carrying on its activities honestly, with integrity and in accordance with law, whether in relations with its employees or with its other stakeholders. These behaviour guidelines are embodied in the Code of Ethics of the Abertis Group, a fundamental set of regulations for the Group. The Code of Ethics includes the principles and values that should guide the behaviour of the various stakeholders. In addition, labour-related sanctions have been established for employees that infringe these principles and values, as well as penalties of a commercial or administrative nature for the other stakeholders.
The Ethics and Crime Prevention Committees are entrusted with the management of ethics and the crime prevention model. The Abertis Group's compliance functions are responsible for the design, implementation and supervision of regulatory compliance and the implementation of the crime prevention model. According to the pattern of Abertis, the Audit and Control Committee regularly monitors complaints and irregularities at all the Group companies. As of December 31, 2018, for the aforementioned reasons, the new Audit and Control Committee has not yet been formed, and is expected to be completed in the coming months.
All the Group companies have whistleblowing mechanisms for reporting irregularities of all kinds that guarantee confidentiality in the investigation and analysis of all communications received.
The corresponding Ethics and Crime Prevention Committees are responsible for investigating and proposing solutions in the event of any complaint or question about the Code of Ethics of the Abertis Group and/or its Local Codes of Ethics.
305

Risk control The Group is exposed to various risks inherent to the various countries in which it operates that may prevent it from achieving its objectives. Therefore, Abertis has implemented a risk management model, approved and monitored generally by the Audit and Control Committee, or, when appropriate, directly by the Board of Directors in the exercise of these functions, applicable to all business units and corporate units in all the countries in which it carries on its business activities. The members of the Parent's managing bodies undertake, on the one hand, to ensure that the Group's significant risks are duly identified, measured and prioritised and, on the other, to establish the basic mechanisms and principles for achieving a level of risk that makes it possible to: (i) achieve sustainable growth in value to the shareholder; (ii) protect the Group's reputation and promote good corporate governance practices; and (iii) provide a quality service in all the infrastructure operated by the Group. The Abertis Group's risk management model aims, among other objectives, to ensure the achievement of the Group's main objectives, the main risks that may affect the achievement of these objectives and the corresponding control measures being as follows:

307

The main risks that arose in 2018 related to political and social instability in some of the countries in which the Group operates (mitigated by internationalisation and geographical diversification), to the continuation of availability restrictions and the public and private financing conditions in certain countries (mitigated by strict financial discipline), to damage caused by adverse weather conditions (mitigated by a corporate insurance coverage and contingency plan policy) and to the reduction of the average life of the toll road concessions (mitigated by the achievement of new public-private partnerships in various countries in which the Group operates, such as France, Chile and Argentina).

1.4. Value creation in 2018
Business performance
In the toll road management business as a whole, which now represents the sole line of business in terms of the contribution to consolidated revenue, up to 31 December 2018 the average daily traffic (ADT), the main indicator of the level of activity, saw a like-for-like increase of +1.8% to 25,120 vehicles, positively impacting the Group's revenue.
In 2018 the volume of business of virtually all of the Group's toll road concession operators improved, the detail of their ADT up to 31 December 2018 being as follows:

Toll roads Spain Toll roads France Toll roads Italy Toll roads Brazil Toll roads Chile Toll roads Puerto Rico Toll roads Argentina Toll roads India Abertis

3.3% 1.7% 1.2% 0.8% 3.0% 7.0% (0.7%) 4.8% 1.8%

308

It can be seen that at 2018 year-end there was a positive trend in activity on the toll roads of Abertis, thanks to strong increases in traffic in the main countries in which the Group operates. Of particular note in this connection were the activity levels achieved in Spain (that continue along the growth trend seen since 2016), the growth of traffic in France and the contribution to growth of Italy and Chile.

Also noteworthy is the recovery, in general terms, in activity in Brazil (a trend that began in 2017 after the fall in traffic recorded in 2016 and 2015, due mainly to a significant fall in heavy vehicle traffic as a result of the negative performance of the Brazilian economy), although during the year it was penalised by the circumstantial effect of a major strike in the transport sector in May, adversely affecting heavy vehicle traffic (which in any case grew by nearly 2%).

Lastly, mention should be made of the positive performance of the business in Puerto Rico, favoured by, among other aspects, the reconstruction work on the island after the damage caused by the hurricanes suffered during September 2017, especially Hurricane Maria.

309

Operating income amounted to EUR 5,255 million in 2017, a slight decrease of -0.3% from 2017, due mainly to:
· The depreciation of the Brazilian real, the Argentine peso, the Chilean peso and the US dollar, the average exchange rates of which against the euro fell by 19%, 4%, 130% and 5%, respectively, with respect to the average exchange rates for 2017, which gave rise to a decrease of EUR 280 million in the Group's revenue.
· The impact of the sale in July 2017 of the Italian A4 subgroup company Infracom.
· The expiry in May 2018 of the concession arrangement of the Brazilian Arteris subgroup company Via Norte.
These impacts were offset substantially in full by:
· The upturn in activity and the impact of the revision of the average tolls at the toll road concession operators.
· The full consolidation of TTPL and JEPL from March 2017 onwards. · The impact associated with the recognition of the outstanding
measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport.
In addition, the Group's results were boosted by the implementation of a series of measures to improve efficiency and optimise operating expenses, on which the Group is continuing, and will continue, to focus in the coming years in order to continue to improve operational efficiency and to optimise costs.
As a result, profit from operations amounted to EUR 2,193 million (2017: EUR 2,089 million).
The decrease in the financial loss is mainly due to the fact that at the end of 2018 it includes a positive impact of EUR 605 million due to the gain obtained on the sale of 34.0% of Cellnex. It should also be noted that the financial loss at 2017 year-end included a negative impact of EUR 53 million associated with the costs incurred in the bond repurchase transactions carried out by Hit, A4 and Libertadores.
310

Borrowing costs fell due mainly to the decrease in the average interest rate on the borrowings in the euro zone and Chile as a result of the refinancing transactions carried out in 2017.
The decrease in the result of the companies accounted for using the equity method was due mainly to the fact that at 2018 year-end it included a nonrecurring expense of EUR 14 million in the earnings contributed by Cellnex up to its sale associated with efficiency plans implemented by this investee.
As a result of all the foregoing, the consolidated profit for 2018 attributable to the shareholders of the Parent amounted to EUR 1,698 million.
Lastly, it should be noted that since the discontinuation of the satellite telecommunications business at the end of 2017 all the Group's revenue has been earned in the toll roads sector.

Total assets at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 28,643 million, a decrease of -3.9% from 2017 year-end, due mainly to the impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso at year-end.
Around 51% of total assets relate to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets (mainly concessions), in line with the nature of the Group's businesses relating to infrastructure management.
The Group invested a total of EUR 944 million in 2018, relating mostly to investments for expansion purposes (88% of the total), mainly in:
· Expanding the capacity of the toll roads, especially those located in Brazil (EUR 257 million) and in France for the improvement and extension of the network (EUR 185 million).
· The acquisition of non-controlling interests in A4 (EUR 33 million) and, following the execution of the purchase commitments acquired in previous years, non-controlling interests in the Indian concession operator JEPL (EUR 15 million) and in Hispasat (EUR 293 million).
Consolidated equity amounted to EUR 5,926 million, +24.1% higher than at 2017 year-end, due, in addition to the profit for the year (the main reason for the aforementioned increase) and the dividends paid, to the following factors:
· The changes in the scope of consolidation with effects on both noncontrolling interests and the Group's accumulated reserves, as a result of the acquisition of non-controlling interests in A4 (EUR +28 million on the Group's reserves and EUR -61 million on noncontrolling interests), on JEPL (EUR +8 million on the Group's reserves and EUR -10 million on non-controlling interests) and on Hispasat (EUR +387 million on the Group's reserves and EUR -378 million on non-controlling interests); in the case of JEPL and Hispasat after the execution of the purchase commitments.
· The increase in translation losses (EUR -288 million, of which EUR -80 million correspond to non-controlling interests), due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso.
312

Main investments
The Group is continuing to focus its efforts on controlling operating costs to improve efficiency and on investing in the development and expansion of the capacity of its assets, having invested more than EUR 600 million in 2018 (excluding its investment in new inorganic growth projects), of which it invested approximately 51% in Brazil, 38% in France, 5% in Chile and 3% in Spain.
The main transactions in 2018 were as follows:
Toll roads
2018 was characterised by the consolidation of the organic and inorganic growth path of the business in Europe, the Americas and Asia, including most notably the transactions aimed at consolidating and strengthening the Group's position at existing investees. Against the backdrop of the transactions to consolidate and strengthen the Group's position as a controlling shareholder with an industrial role, the following transactions are worthy of mention:
· In January Abertis, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Abertis Italia, S.A., completed the acquisition of an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) for a total of EUR 33 million, as a result of which it holds 90.03% of its share capital. With this transaction Abertis completed the various agreements entered into in 2017 to acquire non-controlling interests in its subsidiary A4 enabling it to achieve the aforementioned percentage of ownership.
· In March Abertis, acting through its wholly-owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis India, S.A., completed the acquisition of an additional 26% of the Indian company Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL) for EUR 15 million, giving it an ownership interest of 100% in that company.
313

In parallel, and in order to increase the average life of the current portfolio of concessions, certain agreements were entered into, including most notably the following:
· In March Sol, an Abertis Group subsidiary in Chile entered into an agreement with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works to make new investments in the Autopista del Sol (Ruta 78) toll road amounting to approximately EUR 105 million, in return for an extension of the current contract, which expires in May 2019, to March 2021.
· In July Abertis (through its subsidiaries in Argentina Grupo Concesionario del Oeste, S.A., Gco and Autopista del Sol, S.A., Ausol) entered into agreements with the Argentine National Directorate of Roads (an agency reporting to the Argentine Ministry of Transport) to extend the respective concession arrangements until the end of 2030, in exchange for additional investments to improve the actual networks of the two concession operators amounting to USD 680 million (approximately EUR 594 million at 31 December 2018).
In addition to the investments for inorganic growth, Abertis has also been active in expanding the capacity of its toll roads.
In this regard, Sanef continues to work on improving its network within the framework of the agreement reached with the French Government in prior years to implement "Plan Relance" for French toll roads. This plan provides for improvements in the toll road network through investments of approximately EUR 600 million in the next five to six years in exchange for an extension of the concession terms (by two years for Sanef and by three years and eight months for Sapn). At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 266 million had been made.
It should be noted in this respect that in January 2017 Sanef entered into a memorandum of understanding with the French Government to launch a new investment plan to modernise its network, which was ultimately completed on 24 July 2018. Under the agreement, Sanef will invest EUR 122 million in various projects in exchange for an additional annual increase in tolls for 2019-2021 (0.225% for Sanef and 0.218% for Sapn).
314

This new plan will make it possible to improve the French road network around four basic objectives, namely to improve safety, traffic flow, service quality and environmental sustainability, while lending new impetus to the French economy through large-scale projects to create activity and employment and thus enhance France's business fabric.
The main projects planned include the construction of various road links, an increase in the number of parking spaces for high-occupancy cars and various programmes to protect the water resources of the network.
Arteris continues to carry out toll road extension and upgrade work, particularly in the case of the concession arrangements awarded by the Federal Government. Of particular note in the year was the work to recover road surfaces, widen lanes in Fluminense (on which progress continues to be made), and to continue with the work on the Florianópolis perimeter road, in Litoral Sul, under the terms of the respective concession arrangements. In relation to the concessions in the State of São Paulo, the new ViaPaulista concession is making progress with the initial road recovery work and the construction of operational bases and toll plazas, and is expected to commence operations at the end of this year. It should also be noted that on 17 May 2018 the Vianorte concession was returned to the grantor.
In Chile, the Group continues to negotiate with the Chilean Government the modification of some of the concession arrangements, so that the concession operators may make improvements to the toll road network through new investments in exchange for an extension of the concession term.
In Spain, as detailed in Note 13.i-a, the differences in interpretation continue to exist and, accordingly, the various court proceedings relating to the AP-7 Agreement are still in progress.
Also, regarding Aumar's request to the Spanish Government for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility of the AP7/AP4 concession which it managed, given that the Spanish Cabinet did not issue an express resolution within the legally established period, on 22 July 2015 Aumar filed an appeal for judicial review at the Supreme Court, as it considered that there were sound legal arguments with which to defend its legitimate rights and interests and those of Abertis and its shareholders (see Note 13.i-b).
315

Liquidity and capital resources
The gross bank borrowings at 31 December 2018 (excluding payables to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and bonds and other liabilities) amounts to EUR 16,012 million and represents, on the one hand, 269% of equity, lower than at the end of 2017 (373%), due to the decrease in gross financial debt detailed below and the aforementioned increase in equity, and, on the other, 56% of liabilities and equity, slightly lower than at 2017 year-end (60%) as a result of the abovementioned increase in net assets due mainly to the profit for the year.
Also, the net bank borrowings of Abertis (excluding payables to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and bonds and other liabilities) in 2018 decreased by EUR 2,091 million to EUR 13,275 million.
The aforementioned decrease in gross and net bank borrowings was due mainly due to:
· The impact of the sale of 34.0% of Cellnex for EUR 1,703 million. · The impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 effective 1 January 2018
amounting to EUR 64 million. · The exchange rate effect at 31 December 2018, which led to a
decrease in the Group's net debt of EUR 158 million (due basically to the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso at 31 December 2018).
These effects were partially offset mainly by:
· The effect of the investments in operations and for organic expansion purposes made in the year amounting to EUR 604 million.
· The impact of the acquisition of non-controlling interests in A4 (EUR 33 million), JEPL (EUR 15 million) and Hispasat (EUR 293 million).
· The second payment of shareholder remuneration for 2017 (EUR 365 million considering the dividend associated with the treasury shares).
316

· The payment of EUR 634 million, relating mainly to the pre-payment made in relation to the dividends received by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and to the gain obtained on the sale of Cellnex, which are exempt for tax purposes but which, pursuant to current legislation, were treated as taxable in the income tax pre-payments made.
Due to its investment activity, and mainly in the concession businesses, Abertis is exposed to regulatory and financial risks: foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's global risk management programme takes into account the uncertainty in the financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's overall profitability by establishing financing and hedging policies consistent with the nature of its businesses. In practice, this continues to lead to the existence of a sound financial structure, with a high average debt maturity (5.0 years at both 31 December 2018 and 5.3 years at 31 December 2017, respectively) and, following a policy of minimising exposure to financial risks, a high percentage of debt bears interest at a fixed rate or at a rate fixed through hedges (82% at 31 December 2018 as compared with 79% at 2017 yearend), thus largely minimising the possible effects of credit market tensions.
317

Noteworthy in this regard are the following transactions carried out by various Group companies in 2018:
· The arrangement of loans maturing in 2024 and 2025 amounting to EUR 815 million by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. against which no drawdowns had been made at 31 December 2018.
· The issue by Intervias of new bonds of BRL 800 million (approximately EUR 180 million at 31 December 2018) maturing between May 2020 and May 2025 and with a coupon rate of between 12m CDI +0.47% and 12m CDI +6.76%.
· The issue by Regis Bittencourt of a promissory note of BRL 600 million (approximately EUR 135 million at 31 December 2018) maturing in June 2020 and bearing interest at CDI +107%.
· The drawdown by Régis Bittencourt of BRL 334 million (approximately EUR 78 million at 2018 year-end) against a facility maturing in December 2029 bearing a fixed interest rate of 10.05% (up to BRL 775 million, approximately EUR 174 million at 31 December 2018) may be drawn down.
318

· The arrangement of loans of EUR 50 million and EUR 15 million by A4 Holding and A4 Mobility, respectively, maturing in January and December 2023, respectively.
· The novation by Túnels of the financing agreement of EUR 305 million, extending the term to maturity of the financing to December 2034 and reducing the related borrowing costs.
· The repurchase in full by Rutas del Pacífico of the outstanding balance (CLP 139,448 million, approximately EUR 175 million at 31 December 2018) of bonds issued by it in previous years, amounting to CLP 305,376 million (approximately EUR 385 million at 31 December 2018), maturing in December 2024 and with an annual coupon rate of UF +5.8%.
It should be noted that with these and other transactions the Group reinforces its ability to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the credit market to achieve attractive conditions and continue to generate value for its shareholders. Thus, in 2018 alone the Group has carried out financing transactions (both corporate and at its subsidiaries) exceeding EUR 1,250 million. Lastly, it should be noted that the high cash flow generation of the majority of Abertis's main businesses allows for a financial balance to be achieved, enabling new investments to be made in upgrading the infrastructure it currently manages, as well as the continuation within the current economic and financial scenario of the selective policy of growth investments developed in recent years without the need for additional capital contributions from the shareholders.
319

Credit quality management Abertis has a credit rating assigned by the rating agencies Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings. In this regard, Abertis has a long-term "BBB" Investment-grade adequate credit quality rating awarded by the international credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Ltd. In the latest report, dated October 2018, the "BBB" rating and "stable" outlook were ratified. In addition, in the latest report, dated October 2018, Abertis was awarded a long-term "BBB" credit rating and a short-term "F3" credit rating by the international credit rating agency Fitch Ratings Ltd. The aforementioned latest report also revised the outlook from "negative" to "stable". Abertis's policy is to maintain an Investment-grade credit rating.
320

1.5. Safe and innovative infrastructure
As one of the world's leading toll road operators, Abertis manages its infrastructure under four basic principles that interact with each other and make up its industrial model: road safety, the pursuit of intelligent solutions to boost efficiency and travelling comfort, innovation and the harnessing of the benefits provided by new technologies and a focus on all the Group's stakeholders.
Road safety
Road safety
Abertis places maximum priority on maximising road safety, which it works towards through the global "Road Safety" programme. Through this programme, transversal teams from all disciplines and geographical areas work together at the Group to guarantee knowledge and application of the best practices in road safety on Abertis's toll roads.
Abertis's Road Safety programme encompasses more than 60 years of knowledge and experience in the construction and management of toll roads, complying with the most stringent international standards. Thus, the Group follows the most widely recognised policies and procedures in the industry in order to ensure road safety in all areas of its activity.
The Group invests in intelligent engineering and technology to ensure that its customers have the best experience possible when traveling on its toll roads.
Abertis applies advanced construction and management practices, and cooperates with worldwide benchmark institutions and organisations with a global vision: to achieve the objective of zero fatalities on Abertis's toll roads, with roads that are 100% safe.
As a result of this strategy, the Group works in all its networks to consolidate the low accident levels in its more mature networks, such as Spain, France and Italy, and to continuously improve accident rates in growing markets such as Brazil and India (the latter being a market in which there is significant scope for improvement in the coming years).
321

In this way, the Group has achieved in recent years constant improvement in accident and mortality rates in the main units of the Group, a trend that continued in 2018.

Abertis is continuing to work on a vision of road safety that shares the values of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 20112020, which is founded on five pillars: (i) safe infrastructure; (ii) road safety management; (iii) safer vehicles; (iv) safer road users; and (v) postcrash response.

Optimum safety management
In 2018 the Group worked towards standardising best internal practices across all the Group's units in order to achieve a global stance on road safety.
The Group continued to promote the road safety training of its employees to ensure optimum operation and maintenance through safety drills at most of the concessions.
With a view to systematising practices and monitoring performance on an ongoing basis, in a cycle of continuous improvement, the Group continued with the implementation of a formal road safety management system on its toll roads. Thus, 49% of the toll roads business (Spain except for Túnels, Chile, Argentina with Ausol in the process of obtaining certification and Via Paulista in Brazil) has a management system compliant with the international ISO 39001 standard that has been implemented and/or certified. The Group intends to progressively implement this system in the other countries and/or toll roads.

322

Agreements for safer mobility
Abertis is a member of the Waze 'Connected Citizens' programme, a pioneering application in social navigation and mobile technology that offers free real-time traffic information, fed by the largest community of drivers in the world. Seven countries in which the Group operates (Spain, France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico) work with Waze to improve the information and road safety of their citizens.
Abertis uses this application as a sensor to understand traffic in real time as well as another communication channel to inform its customers about traffic conditions, roadworks or the presence of workers on the road. At the same time, Abertis receives anonymous real-time information directly from source, namely, the drivers.
Predictive approach
Abertis uses its in-house software and control systems of independent entities such as the iRAP Foundation (International Road Assessment Programme), to improve road control. Abertis is the first private toll road operator to cooperate globally with iRAP. This methodology allows Abertis to ascertain the level of safety on its toll roads in a uniform and highly professional manner, identifying all areas open to improvement in order to define the Group's future investment plans.
Safer road users
Abertis focuses not only on infrastructure, but also on its customers, through studies and observatories of their driving to get to know them better and through safe-driving awareness campaigns.
Post-crash response
The Group continues to work to offer the best solutions in the event of an accident. The latest innovations at Abertis include advanced intelligent transport systems and an application that automatically detects irregular situations in tunnels.
323

Innovation: R&D+i activities
The management team of Abertis has reached the conclusion that the management of the mobility of the future will bring important challenges but also great opportunities. Therefore, in recent years the Group has been working on its "Road Tech" strategic programme, by means of an intersection between road infrastructure and new technologies, with the objective of making the Group a platform for safer, smarter and more sustainable mobility.
Road Tech
Abertis concerns itself with the mobility of the future. It manages toll roads efficiently and in a modern way, innovating in technology and investing in intelligent engineering programs for a sustainable future. In line with this objective, Abertis has implemented the "Road Tech" programme, which seeks to capture Abertis's vision of creating a future in which the world's roads provide all the social and economic benefits of mobility without jeopardising the environment, health or safety.
With the "Road Tech" programme, Abertis promotes projects aimed at meeting new mobility challenges, such as electric, connected or autonomous vehicles. The Road Tech programme is based on the following pillars:
· Solutions for smart roads and integrated mobility, such as the European project for cooperative transport and autonomous driving systems (C-Roads) and advanced communication solutions applied to mobility between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I connectivity) and application of the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor the state of the infrastructure, as well as to improve service and optimise operations.
· Solutions for connected and autonomous vehicles, such as the project for the deployment of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (CITS) in 3,000 vehicles and on 2,000 km of roads to exchange information on traffic conditions (SCOOP@F Project).
· Solutions for electric vehicles, such as the projects for the development of wireless on-road charging (Fabric) and electric corridors for heavy vehicles (E-way corridor).
324

Efficient toll roads
At Abertis, innovation encompasses many areas. On the one hand, through analysis of how new mobility trends can impact the traditional business model and, on the other, through a commitment to a new line of business, based on Mobility as a Service (MasS), which shifts the focus of mobility away from the mode of transport to the individual, who understands mobility as a point-to-point service, with new and different needs.
Abertis Mobility Services
Abertis Mobility Services was conceived to respond to these changes, and to become the pioneer in modern and efficient mobility focused on different types of customers: on the one hand, administrations and road operators (B2A), through the subsidiary Emovis and, on the other, to vehicle fleet companies (B2B), through Eurotoll. The latter is one of the largest issuers of electronic payment devices, or OBUs (On-Board-Units) in Europe. Lastly, the citizen is the direct customer of subsidiaries such as Bip&Go and Bip&Drive, in the toll payment device sector.
Abertis Mobility Services leads the Group's firm commitment to innovation, based on three strategic lines for guiding its projects and actions:
i) Free-flow systems
Abertis offers free-flow mobility solution advisory, design, implementation, operation and maintenance services through its Emovis technology and services division.
The division operates some of the largest electronic toll infrastructure in the world in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada. Emovis operates in seven countries: Canada, the US, Puerto Rico, the UK, Ireland, France and Croatia.
325

ii) Interoperability and payment devices
The Abertis Group is working to make travel a comfortable and easy experience for the customer.
· Eurotoll continues to increase the interoperability of its Tribox Air device, equipped with DSRC/GNSS/GSM and "over-the-air" technology, offering a single device for travelling in France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Belgium and Germany. In 2018 it was accredited to operate with Viapass (Belgium) and REETS Asfinag (Austria). It also offers its customers value added services, such as geolocation, long distance journey monitoring, etc.
· Bip&Go and Bip&Drive, investees of Abertis that offer payment devices, are also making progress with the interoperability of their devices, not only between countries, but also for their use off-the-road (shopping centres, petrol stations, car parks, etc.). In 2018 Bip&Drive, a subsidiary of the Group in Spain, consolidated its position as the leader in the Spanish market for the VIA-T device, with 875,000 customers and a market share of over 30%. Additionally, it launched the new app that facilitates payment in service stations, petrol stations, vehicle roadworthiness testing centres and electric recharging points.
· VíasChile, through Autopase, its payment device issuer, has also made advances in its quest to achieve interoperability between the division's concession operators in Chile.
iii) Advanced payment systems
The Abertis Group continues to innovate in payment systems and models. The projects performed in 2018 include most notably:
· In Brazil, Centrovias (Arteris) has implemented OCR technology that operates as a toll collection system. In case of a reading error, the system recognises the number plate and authorises the vehicle to proceed. This initiative is being replicated by the federal concession operators of Arteris and has been acknowledged by the grantor ARTESP as an innovative project.
· In Argentina, the PIM-toll prepaid electronic toll system has been launched, developed in conjunction with Banco de la Nación Argentina, which makes it possible to associate a virtual wallet with a mobile phone. In this case, the mobile phone is not required to pay the toll, but rather to subscribe to the system by associating the TAG with the telephone number or bank account.
326

· In France, Sanef is also trialling mobile payment on the A13 and A14 toll roads, which will be able to be used from April 2019 onwards.
· In Spain, Ronda Gi, the free "sticker" designed to facilitate mobility without stops between the toll plazas on the Girona ring road stretch of the AP-7 toll road, has now been in operation for a year. In 2018 Autopistas distributed 10,000 free devices among the users of this stretch of road.
As a result of these improvements, the percentage of automatic or electronic toll transactions increased at the Group from 76.4% to 78.0% of the total (+1.6%), including most notably Puerto Rico (99.6%), France (98.0%), Chile (87,7%), Spain (85.2%) and Italy (80.2%).
1.6. Environmental contribution The information on the environmental contribution is presented in the statement of non-financial information in the integrated annual report attached to this directors' report.
1.7. Human capital The information on human capital is presented in the statement of nonfinancial information in the integrated annual report attached to this directors' report.
1.8. Contribution to the community The information on the contribution to the community is presented in the statement of non-financial information in the integrated annual report attached to this directors' report.
327

1.9. Other disclosures
In accordance with Article 49 of the Spanish Commercial Code, the statement of non-financial information is presented in the integrated annual report attached to this directors' report. That report was prepared in accordance with the standards of the full version of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) framework. This statement of non-financial information forms part of the directors' report and is subject to the same approval, deposit and publication criteria as the directors' report.
The annual corporate governance report, which is part of the directors' report, can be found in the appendices at the end of this report, and is also available on the websites of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Abertis Group.
Treasury shares
As indicated in Note 15.i-a, the Board of Directors meeting of Abertis held on 25 September 2018, exercising the powers granted to it by the EGM held on 25 July 2018, resolved to reduce the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by EUR 236,448 thousand through the retirement of 78,815,937 treasury shares of EUR 3 par value each, representing 7.9581% of its share capital.
The objective of the capital reduction was to retire the treasury shares held by Abertis.
Also, in accordance with the authorisation approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, at year-end the Company held 8,500 treasury shares (0.001% of its share capital). The use to which the treasury shares will be put has not been decided upon and will depend on such resolutions as might be adopted by the Group's governing bodies.
The transactions involving treasury shares carried out in 2018 are disclosed in Note 15-a.ii to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
328

Alternative Performance Measures
Abertis believes that certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) provide financial information in addition to that obtained from the applicable accounting standards (EU-IFRSs) that is useful for assessing the performance of the Group and which is used by management in its decisionmaking processes. In this regard, in accordance with the recommendations issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
On the other hand, as a result of the change of shareholders of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., in 2018 the Group has modified the definition or name of certain APMs and/or has incorporated additional APMs in relation to those considered in previous years. These changes have been carried out with the objective of providing homogenenous information to the users of these consolidated financial statements, according to their integration in an upper consolidated group.
The definition and determination of main APM used is as follows:

i) Revenues
Relates to the caption of consolidated statements of profit or loss "Operating income".

Revenues ­ Operating income

2018 5,255,381

2017 5,270,909

ii) Opex or Operating expenses

Relates to the caption of consolidated statements of profit or loss "Operating income".

Opex ­ Operating expenses

2018 3,083,142

2017 3,236,874

329

iii) Ebit ­ Profit from operations

Relates to the caption of consolidated statements of profit or loss "Profit from operations".

EBIT ­ Profit from operations

2018 2,193,252

2017 2,089,191

iv) Ebitda
Ebitda or Gross Operating Profit is defined as EBIT adjusted by the captions of the consolidated financial statements "Depreciation and amortisation charge", "Changes in impairment losses on assets" and "Capitalised borrowing costs":

EBIT ­ Profit from operations +Depreciation and amortisation charge +/- Changes in impairment losses on assets - Capitalised borrowing costs EBITDA

2018
2,193,252 1,377,321
(589) (21,013) 3,548,971

2017
2,089,191 1,421,197
543 (55,156) 3,455,775

The Group considers Ebitda as an operational indicator that measures the cash generation capacity of its assets, while it is an indicator widely used by analysts, investors, credit rating agencies and other stakeholders.

v) Ebitda margin

Ebitda margin is a relative indicator used by the Group to analyze the operating performance of its assets, representing the relative weight of Ebitda on revenues:

Ebitda ­ Gross operating profit Revenue (Operating income) Ebitda margin

2018
3,548,971 5,255,381
67.53%

2017
3,455,775 5,270,909
65.56%

330

It is important to highlight that "Ebitda margin" is not a measure adopted in accounting standards and does not have a standardised meaning and, therefore, cannot be compared to the Ebitda margin of other companies.

vi) Ebitda contribution
"Ebitda Contribution" is the percentage reflecting the proportion of the Ebitda contributed by each of the business against that of the whole Group.

vii) Gross debt
"Gross debt" is defined as the non-current and current "Bank loans" and "Bond issues and other loans" line items as shown in the Nota 16 of the consolidated financial statements:

Bank loans Bond issues and other loans Gross debt

2018
4,982,698 11,029,432 16,012,130

2017
6,098,691 11,725,935 17,824,626

viii) Net debt

"Net Debt" is defined as "Gross Debt" less the "Cash and cash equivalents" line item in the consolidated financial statements.

Gross debt Cash and cash equivalents Net debt

2018
16,012,130 (2,737,070) 13,275,060

2017
17,824,626 (2,458,101) 15,366,525

The Group uses the "Net Debt" as a measure of its solvency and liquidity as it indicates the current cash and equivalents in relation to its total debt liabilities. "Net Debt" and "Ebitda" derived measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and rating agencies as an indication of financial leverage.

331

ix) Net Financial Debt

"Net Financial Debt" is defined as "Financial liabilities" (current and noncurrent) less "Other financial assets" (current and non-current) and "Cash and cash equivalents" line items of the consolidated financial statements.

"Net Financial Debt" is an indicator of the portion of the investments financed by net financial liabilities.

The reconciliation of APM with the Group consolidated financial statements

is as follows:

2018

2017

Non-current financial liabilities Current financial liabilities Other non-current financial assets Other current financial assets Cash and cash equivalents Net financial debt ­ continuous operations

15,757,865 1,654,482

x) Capex

Relates to the "Purchases of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other concession infrastructure" line item in the consolidated statements of net cash flows from investing activities of the consolidated financial statements:

Purchases of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other concession infrastructure

2018 619,733

2017 1,132,727

332

The Company considers this an important indicator because it represents the ability of the Company to expand its portfolio through the discretionary use of cash in investments for the improvements of the highway network for agreed returns in the case of the road assets and measuring how effectively the Company is redeploying resources to build a perpetual business model as it contributes for EBITDA replacement and the increase of the duration its portfolio. Although the Company has previously reported CAPEX split by Operating CAPEX and Organic Expansion CAPEX, in 2018 the Company has decided to start only providing total CAPEX because the former split is understood not to provide relevant information for investors and analysts which have demonstrated to be more focused on the total CAPEX amount when assessing the Group's performance.
xi) Discretionary cash flow "Discretionary cash flow" is defined as Ebitda plus/minus finance income and costs, minus income tax expense and plus/minus cash adjustments to: (i) finance income and expenses, (ii) income tax, (iii) IFRIC12 and other provisions, (iv) concession arrangements ­ financial asset model, and (v) dividends received from financial investments, associates and joint ventures. The Group believes that the "Discretionary cash flow" is one of the most important indicators of its capacity to generate an available stream of resources from the operations, net from the mandatory uses of cash for taxes and interest expenses, to be used mainly and according to the Group strategy to repay debt, distribute dividends and expand its portfolio.

Events after the reporting period
There were no events after the reporting period other than those indicated in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
Outlook
2018 was marked by the successful completion of the tender offer for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. ultimately launched solely by Hochtief, which led to a joint investment by Atlantia (ultimately the new majority shareholder), ACS and Hochtief, as described in Note 15-a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2018.
Thus, with the change in the shareholder structure of Abertis following the success of the tender offer for all its shares completed at the end of October with the aforementioned joint investment, and now that the 2015-2017 strategic plan has been completed, the coming months will see the identification (together with the new shareholders) of new challenges and opportunities so that in 2019 the Group can establish a new three-year plan.
The Group intends to continue to focus its energies on growth (with a clear commitment to international growth), a strategic priority that will be developed, either through new acquisitions or through the extension of existing concessions in exchange for new investments, all with the aim of enabling Abertis to continue to be one of the leading and benchmark Groups in the toll road infrastructure sector, without forgetting its vocation to serve customers, governments and society in general.
The Group will continue to analyse opportunities in its more traditional markets such as Europe and the Americas, seeking to promote in its portfolio a balanced mix between new concessions and other more mature ones, always remaining vigilant of new opportunities for the Group and its shareholders.
In addition, the Group will continue to work on the ambitious investment plans currently under way for improvements in Brazil, France or Italy.
In any case, in terms of activity, for 2019 consolidation, and the concomitant continuation of the growth path taken by the Spanish, French, Italian, Brazilian, Chilean, Puerto Rican and Indian toll roads are both foreseeable.
335

In the efficiency area, the Group will continue to make progress in the efforts made in recent years at both corporate and business unit level. All of the foregoing without neglecting the aim to strengthen the Group's strategic programmes: Road Safety and Road Tech (applicable to all the Group's business units). In addition, in the CSR management field, the Group will update the materiality analysis including the new activities and geographical locations so as to continue to improve the Group's best practices in the CSR management area, through the implementation of the CSR Master Plan.
336

Description of the restrictions
B. GENERAL MEETING OR EQUIVALENT BODY
B.1 List the quorums for convening the General Meeting or equivalent body established in the bylaws. Describe how these differ from the system of minimum quorums established in the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law (LSC) or in the applicable legislation.
The Company's bylaws have increased the quorums established in Articles 193 and 194 of the LSC.
Article 17 of the Company's bylaws establishes that the General Meeting, whether annual or extraordinary, is deemed to be validly convened at first call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least eighty per cent (80%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights plus two (2) shares.
The General Meeting is deemed to be validly convened at second call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least fifty per cent (50%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights.
Article 193 of the LSC establishes that the General Meeting of a public limited liability company is deemed to be validly convened at first call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights, and that it is deemed to be validly convened at second call regardless of the capital of the attendees.
Article 194 of the LSC establishes the qualified quorum for convening the General Meeting in special cases, such as capital increases or reductions and any amendments to the Company bylaws, issues of debt instruments, the removal or limitation of new share pre-emption rights, etc., which will require at first call the attendance of shareholders in person or by proxy holding at least fifty per cent (50%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights, and at second call at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of such capital.

B.2 Explain the system for adopting corporate resolutions. Describe how this differs from the system established in the LSC or in the applicable legislation.
The Company bylaws have increased the majorities required for the adoption of resolutions, established in Article 201 of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law.
Article 18 of the Company bylaws establishes that the resolutions are adopted by an absolute majority of the shares attending the General Meeting in person or by proxy, with one vote per share, except for the resolutions that must be approved by a greater majority in accordance with the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law.
As an exception, the approval of resolutions relating to the following matters ("Reserved Matters"), when they must be submitted for the approval of the Company's General Meeting, require, in any case, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five per cent (65%) plus one (1) share of the subscribed share capital with voting rights:
(i) amendment of the bylaws, including, but not limited to, any amendment of the structure of the managing body or of the number of members thereof, or any increase, reduction, variation or other change in the share capital
(ii) the issuance of any security, equity instrument or equity-related instrument, or of any other synthetic security or instrument (such as, among others, convertible debentures);
(iii) any merger, spin-off, segregation, transfer of assets and liabilities en bloc, international relocation of registered office or any other structural changes, except when such transactions only affect the Company and wholly-owned investees;
(iv) a request for admission to listing, the launch of a public offering or the subscription of all or a portion of the shares of the Company or of a controlled company;
(v) the distribution of dividends and/or reserves, when not performed at all times in line with the dividends policy approved by the Company's Board of Directors, and the approval of the amendment of the Company's dividends policy;
(vi) any M&A transaction (i.e. acquisitions, sales or capital investments in assets or investments in projects) the amount of which, in aggregate terms for an annual period, exceeds eighty million euros (EUR 80,000,000);
(vii) the approval or amendment of the financial or dividends policy of the Company and its Group; and
(viii) any related-party transaction.
Article 201 of the LSC establishes that the corporate resolutions of public limited liability companies are adopted by means of a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending the General Meeting in person or by proxy. In this case, the majority required by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is an absolute majority, while that established by the LSC is a simple majority.
Also, Article 201 of the LSC establishes that, for the resolutions referred to in Article 194 of the LSC (qualified quorum for convening the General Meeting in special cases described in the preceding section), if the capital attending or represented by proxy exceeds fifty per cent (50%), the resolution may be adopted by means of an absolute majority. However, the affirmative vote of two thirds of the share capital present in person or by proxy at the General Meeting is required when at second call there are shareholders in attendance representing twenty-five per cent (25%) or more, but less than fifty per cent (50%), of the subscribed share capital with voting rights.

Observations Based on the information reported by the companies, there are no significant transactions with other Group companies that are not eliminated on consolidation and do not form part of the Company's normal course of business.

D.4 Give details of the mechanisms in place for detecting, identifying and resolving any potential conflicts of interest between the entity or its group and its directors, members of the managing body or executives.
Articles 28 et seq of the Board Regulations contain specific obligations regarding the duty of loyalty and information on shares of the Board members in the Company itself or on ownership interests held by them in other non-Group companies. In particular, the duty of loyalty obliges the members of the Board to adopt the measures required to avoid situations in which their interests, either as independent professionals or as employees, may be in conflict with the interests of, and their duties to, the Company except in those cases in which the Company authorised the transaction with respect to which conflict arises.

The Directors must notify the other Directors and, where appropriate, the Board of Directors of any direct or indirect conflict of interest that they or persons related to them might have with the interests of the Company. The director in question shall refrain from involvement in resolutions or decisions on the transaction to which the conflict of interest relates and his vote shall be deducted when calculating the majority of votes whenever necessary.
In accordance with the Board Regulations, the duty to avoid conflicts of interest obliges the director to refrain from performing transactions with the Company other than ordinary transactions performed under standard customer conditions and of scant significance, i.e. where the related information is not necessary to present fairly the equity, financial position and results of the Company. Directors shall refrain from using the Company's name or invoking their position as director to unduly influence the performance of personal transactions, from taking advantage of social events, including confidential information of the Company for personal purposes and of the Company's business opportunities and obtaining advantages or remuneration from third parties other than the Company and its Group, associated with the discharge of their position, except in relation to actions of mere courtesy. The director shall also refrain from performing activities, as an independent professional or as an employee, that are in (current or potential) effective competition with the Company or that, in any other way, place them in situation of permanent conflict with the interests of the Company.
The provisions set out in this section shall also apply if the beneficiary of the acts or of the prohibited activities is a person related to the director.
The conflicts of interest are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
The Company may waive the prohibitions described above in certain cases, authorising a director or a related person to perform a certain transaction with the Company, to use certain corporate assets, to take advantage of a specific business opportunity or to obtain an advantage or compensation from a third party.
Where the subject-matter of the authorisation is exemption from the prohibition on obtaining an advantage or compensation from third parties, or where it relates to a transaction whose value exceeds 10% of the corporate assets, the authorisation must necessarily be resolved upon by the General Meeting.
In all other cases, the authorisation may be granted by the Board of Directors, provided that the independence of the Board members granting the exemption is guaranteed with respect to the exempt director. It shall also be necessary to ensure the harmless nature of the authorised transaction regarding assets and liabilities and, where appropriate, its performance on an arm's length basis and the transparency of the process.
The obligation not to compete with the Company may only be subject to exemption in the event that no damage is expected to arise at the Company or the expected damage is offset by the benefits expected to be obtained as a result of the exemption. The exemption shall be granted by means of an express individual resolution of the General Meeting. In any event, at the request of any shareholder, the General Meeting shall resolve on the removal of the director carrying on competing activities where the risk of damage to the Company is deemed significant.
Lastly, the Company's internal Code of Conduct in matters relating to securities markets, establishes that persons in conflict of interest situations shall act at all times with loyalty to the Company, irrespective of their interests as independent professionals or employees and shall refrain from taking part in or influencing decisions on the matters affected by the conflict. The aforementioned persons must also notify the Company of the possible conflicts of interest to which they are subject as a result of their family relationships, their personal assets, their activities outside of the Company or for any other reason.

E. RISK CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
E.1 Explain the scope of the entity's Risk Control and Management System.
The Board of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is allocated the task of preparing the risk strategy, entrusting this function to the Audit and Control Committee, which establishes the Risk Control and Management Policy of the Abertis Group and supervises the risk management system and its commitment to the application of the tax best practices. The Abertis Group implements a risk management model, approved and monitored by the Audit and Control Committee, and applicable to all the business and corporate units in all the countries where the Group carries on its activities. The risk management model covers all the Group's possible risks with the aim of ensuring achievement of the Group's main objectives. Based on the directives defined by the Corporate Risk Control unit, each of the business and corporate units is responsible for preparing and maintaining its risk map which includes identification and assessment of the inherent and residual risks, of the control initiatives and activities implemented, those in charge thereof, and of the action plans defined to cover the residual risks. The risk maps are checked and approved by the general managers of the business unit or by the managers of the corporate areas. The aforementioned risk maps are subject to periodic review by the Audit and Control Committee and the Management Committee which also monitor the main risks more frequently.
E.2 Identify the entity's bodies in charge of preparing and executing the Risk Control and Management System.
The members of the managing bodies undertake to ensure that the Group's significant risks are duly and acceptably identified, measured, prioritised and controlled, and to establish the basic mechanisms and policies required to achieve a level of risk that enables:
 The creation of value for shareholders.
 Protection of the Group's reputation, fostering of good Corporate Governance practices and commitment through the application of tax best practices.
 Provision of a quality service in all the Group-operated infrastructures. The bodies responsible for definition, execution and oversight are as follows:
Board of Directors: retains ultimate responsibility for the definition of the risk strategy and of the risk control policy.
Audit and Control Committee: is responsible for supervision of the risk control systems, including approval of the model and periodic monitoring of the risks with varying frequencies based on the criticality and significance thereof.
Corporate Risk Control: is responsible for the preparation and update of the risk management policies, ensuring effective implementation of the model, establishing a common methodology for the identification, classification and assessment of risks, coordinating the update of the risk maps, implementing a monitoring and reporting system for the governing bodies and, in cooperation with the other areas of the Group, reviewing the control activities that mitigate the identified risks and monitoring of the action plans.
Business/corporate unit General Managers: are in charge of risk management in their respective areas of responsibility which includes the implementation of the risk policies defined,

validation of the risk maps, and supervision of the implementation of control activities and action plans to mitigate risks.
Business/corporate unit risk coordinators: are responsible for coordinating implementation of each unit or area's risk management model which includes the identification and assessment thereof, as well as the implementation of a system for the control, monitoring and reporting of emerging risks to the Corporate Risk Control Unit. The risk coordinator, together with those in charge of each area, periodically prepares the risk updates and the detail of control activities, as well as information on the status of action plans.
Function supervisors: are those responsible for identifying risks in their respective areas and notifying their unit risk coordinator appropriately. They are also responsible for the identification and implementation of the control activities aimed at mitigating risks.
The responsibilities defined in the foregoing section are detailed in the "Framework Risk Management Policy" which is subject to review by and the approval of the Audit and Control Committee.
E.3 Indicate the main risks that might affect the achievement of the business objectives.
The business objectives may be adversely affected by the following main risks:
 Business environment-related risks inherent to economic performance, arising from decreased demand in certain countries, amendments to legislation (tax, legal and environmental), socio-political change, or adverse weather conditions.
 Specific risks arising as a result of the Group's business activities such as the maturity and term of concessions, agreements with public authorities, the performance of transactions on regulated markets, fulfilment of concession obligations and investment commitments and the entry into service of alternative infrastructures.
 Financial risks inherent to growth operations and investment financing processes, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, rating control and refinancing needs.
 Operating risks relating to user and personnel safety, adaptation and swift response to technological changes in operating systems, control of construction projects, infrastructure maintenance, the security, integrity and confidentiality of financial and corporate information and business know-how, personnel selection and performance, training and retention of talent, fraud, supplier dependence and business interruption.
E.4 Identify whether the entity has risk tolerance levels.
Tolerance levels are defined in the risk assessment matrix which provides the basis for the assessment of the inherent and residual risks. Various scales of possible impacts are established taking into consideration economic and reputational criteria, or obligations relating to liability.

The parameters specified in the risk matrix are updated based on Group performance and subject to annual review and approval by the Audit and Control Committee.
Given the impact their possible materialisation might have on the achievement of objectives, specific tolerance levels are defined for the risks considered to be critical, indicating action guidelines, deadlines for achievement, the persons responsible and monitoring indicators, in addition to setting out the frequency and content of the information to be furnished to the governing bodies for monitoring and decision-making purposes.
A system of alerts has been set up for the remaining risks to ensure identification of material changes in measurement or significant control weaknesses outside the approved tolerance levels for the related risks.
E.5 Indicate any risks that arose during the year.
The risks identified in the risk maps of the various business or corporate units are, in the main, risks inherent to the business model and to the various activities carried on by the Abertis Group. Accordingly, to a certain extent the risks could arise in the course of each financial year.
The most significant risks to materialise in the current year were as follows:
 Political and social instability in certain countries in which the Group operates has given rise to uncertainty as to the potential impact on the performance of the Group's activities; however, swift decision-making and the internationalisation and geographical diversification of the businesses has ensured that there was no significant impact on the Group.
 The ongoing restrictions on the availability and terms and conditions of public and private funding pose a risk in terms of the Group's growth strategy (financing of new growth transactions and investment commitments), but have been mitigated thanks to the Group's strict financial discipline with guidelines and limits defined by the governing bodies and comprehensive monitoring of the entire organisation.
 The significant expiries of certain toll road concessions in the short and medium term are being mitigated through agreements entered into with the grantors, such as that entered into in July 2018 for the extension of the concession term of the Gco and Ausol network in Argentina until 2030 in exchange for making investments to upgrade the road network for amounts of EUR ~215 million and EUR ~ 250 million, respectively.
E.6 Explain the response and oversight plans for the entity's main risks, as well as the procedures followed by the entity to ensure that the Board of Directors responds to the new challenges it faces.
The risk management model implemented by the Abertis Group sets out the level of oversight and the performance of specific initiatives or response plans for the main risks based on the assessment or the level of criticality thereof in order to ensure that risks are contained within the defined limits. A group of risks for priority monitoring is defined (at least each quarter) and the risks selected are reviewed by the Audit and Control Committee.

The response plans for the priority-monitoring risk group form part of the implementation of the specific initiatives for each of the aforementioned risks and include:  Main milestones to be achieved
 Persons responsible for implementation and monitoring within the organisation
 Monitoring indicators
 Content and frequency of the information to be furnished to governing bodies to ensure prompt decision-making.
Risks of a strategic and business nature due to the economic environment, regulatory changes and the specific nature of the concession business are monitored by the management committees whereas financial and operating risks are, in the main, monitored by the corporate committees in coordination with the related committees of the various business units (security committees, operating committees, technical committees, etc.).
Response plans vary based on each risk type and address issues such as:
 The internationalisation and geographical diversification strategy due to the economic downturn in certain countries and periods, offset by increased demand in response to growth in other countries In 2018 Abertis continued to strengthen its international presence with new public-private partnerships and/or acquisitions in a significant portion of the countries in which it operates.
 Cost optimisation based on the definition, implementation and monitoring of the efficiency plans, which place special emphasis on optimising the operating costs and controlling the operating investments of all the business units within the Abertis Group.
 Dialogue with the parties involved in order to provide tailor-made solutions in the infrastructure industry, adapted to each country, and negotiations with public authorities, occasionally agreeing on specific investment commitments. Accordingly, in 2018 Abertis entered into an agreement through GCO and AUSOL, Abertis Group companies in Argentina, which envisages an investment plan to upgrade the road network in exchange for the extension of the current arrangements until the end of 2030.
 Definition of policies and procedures for the most important risks in order to control risk performance within the defined limits.
 Adhesion to the Code of Good Tax Practices with the aim of enhancing Abertis Group companies' corporate responsibility in addition to bringing greater stability to its economic results and greater legal certainty. The Abertis Group implemented the content of the Code of Good Tax Practices effectively.
 The maintenance of an appropriate insurance policy that guarantees coverage of the main types of damage, particularly catastrophes.
F. SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR SYSTEM)
Describe the mechanisms comprising the entity's systems of internal control and risk management relating to financial reporting (ICFR system).

F.1 The entity's control environment Provide information, indicating salient features, on at least:
F.1.1. Bodies and/or functions responsible for: (i) the existence and maintenance of a suitable, effective ICFR system; (ii) its implementation; and (iii) its oversight.
The System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) of the Abertis Group ("the Group" or "Abertis") forms part of its general internal control system and consists of a set of processes performed by the Board of Directors, the Audit and Control Committee (ACC), senior executives and Group personnel, in order to provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of the financial information disseminated in the markets.
The "Policy for the Definition of Responsibilities for the System of Internal Control over the Financial Reporting of the Abertis Group" establishes the following lines of responsibility and authority in relation to the ICFR system:
 Abertis' Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for all the regulated information the Group disseminates and, accordingly, for preparing the financial reporting (Article 4 of the Board Regulations) and ensuring that its ICFR system is adequate and effective.
 In accordance with the bylaws and the Board Regulations, the main responsibilities of the ACC include, inter alia:
o Overseeing and analysing, prior to submission to the Board, the Group's statutory financial reporting process, reviewing correct compliance with the legislation in force and application of the accounting principles.
o Overseeing the effectiveness and sufficiency of the Group's system of internal control and risk assessment, with the aim that any risk (operating, financial, technological, legal or reputational) with a significant impact on the Group's financial reporting may be identified, managed and mitigated, and communicated to the Board of Directors.
o Overseeing the independence of the External Auditor, supervising its work.
o Overseeing the work performed by the Corporate Risk Control and Internal Audit Department, ensuring its independence and verifying that the recommendations and corrective measures it makes are considered by management.
 The Corporate Management Control and Planning Department (reporting to General Financial Management) is responsible for the design, maintenance and implementation of the ICFR system.
 Abertis' Internal Audit function assumes the oversight of the ICFR system delegated by the ACC.
F.1.2. Indicate the following, if in place, particularly in connection with the financial reporting process:

 The departments and/or mechanisms in charge of: (i) the design and review of the organisational structure; (ii) defining clear lines of responsibility and authority, with an appropriate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) ensuring procedures are in place to communicate this structure effectively throughout the entity:
Abertis' Board of Directors assigns responsibility for the design and review of the organisational structure to the Compensation and Organisation Department of the People and Organisation Area. This department define the general outline of the organisational structure, the distribution of responsibilities and the hierarchy of the job positions, as well as related legislation. The result of these mechanisms is documented in the form of organisational charts (organisational structure), the manuals of functions and job position descriptions (establishing allocation, distribution and segregation of functions) and maps of job position assessments (establishing the levels of responsibility).
The Group has an internal organisational chart that is found on the corporate intranet. It covers all the areas, locations and companies belonging to the Group and is basically organised by line of business and department (including those departments involved in the preparation, analysis and oversight of financial reporting). The organisational chart indicates responsibilities up to a certain management level and is supplemented with other more detailed organisational charts provided at department level.
With respect to the financial reporting process, in addition to the detailed organisational charts, manuals, internal policies and instructions are issued by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department (included in the Group's unified reporting manual), which establish the specific guidelines and responsibilities at each reporting date (close procedures defining the main tasks both at corporate and subsidiary level), including most notably:
 "Group Reporting and Accounting Policies Handbook" (GRAPH): this handbook encompasses the accounting policies used by the Group to prepare its financial statements and its aim is to obtain consistent, uniform and comparable financial information for all the Group companies.
 "Close instructions": published every six months, establish the schedule to be followed by the Group companies when submitting the financial reporting and other procedures to be applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated information.
 "Policy for Accounting Close at Subsidiaries": establishes the procedures to be followed to prepare the economic and financial information of the Group subsidiaries and the associated oversight procedures.
 Code of conduct, approving body, dissemination and instruction, principles and values covered (stating whether it makes specific reference to record keeping and financial reporting), body in charge of investigating breaches and proposing corrective or disciplinary action:
Abertis has a Code of Conduct (Code of Ethics), approved by the Board of Directors which is adapted by each business unit, through the preparation of a Local Code of Ethics, when required by the national laws, customs and practices of the country where the business unit operates. In any event, the Local Codes of Ethics must follow the guidelines of the Group's Code of Ethics. Also, the Abertis business units with head offices in Spain are subject to the

Code of Ethics Regulations in Spain which regulate and prohibit any conduct that could imply criminal liability for legal entities.
Training is provided for new employees, and all employees are required to accept Abertis' Code of Ethics each year. Training is available on the company intranet and the Abertis website.
The core values and principles enshrined in the Code of Ethics are as follows: integrity, honesty, transparency, legal compliance, avoidance of conflicts of interest, treatment of information with the maximum strictness, appropriate use and protection of company assets, the guarantee of equal opportunities, non-discrimination of people and no reprisals against reports in good faith of breaches of the Group's Code of Ethics and its Local Codes of Ethics. Also the Code of Ethics provides that treatment of information must be truthful, so that the Group's economic and financial information reflects fairly its economic, financial and equity position, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable international financial reporting standards.
The bodies in charge of investigating breaches and proposing corrective or disciplinary action are the Abertis Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees and its Compliance functions. All the Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees are presided over by the relevant Local Compliance Officer, in cooperation with the Chief Compliance Officer. The Group's Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for reporting to the Abertis ACC about all the instances of non-compliance detected either by the Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees or by the Group's Compliance functions. Also, these bodies have the cooperation of the Group's various management areas, including the Management Control Department of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., for monitoring compliance with its internal policies. This operating mechanism is described in the Group's Compliance Policy, published on the company intranet and the Abertis website, as well as in the Group's policies.
 Whistle-blowing channel, for reporting any irregularities of a financial or accounting nature, as well as breaches of the code of conduct and irregular activities within the organisation to the Audit Committee, stating, as applicable, whether such reports are confidential.
The whistle-blowing channel is managed by the Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees and facilitates the reporting of any irregularities of a financial, accounting or nonfinancial nature.
As established in the whistle-blowing channel procedure, breaches may be reported using an online form (available on the company intranet and on the Abertis website), by post or by email. Also, all Group rules establish the requirement to report any breach of the rules to the Chief Compliance Officer of Abertis. The ACC periodically monitors the reports of breaches and of how they are handled and resolved, as well as the detection of risks of non-compliance detected by the Group's corresponding Compliance functions.
 Training and periodic refresher courses for personnel involved in preparing and reviewing financial information or evaluating the system of ICFR, which address, at least, accounting rules, auditing, internal control and risk management.

As regards training and periodic refresher courses, Abertis considers the development and ongoing training of its employees and executives, both at corporate and subsidiary level, in those issues affecting the preparation of the Abertis Group's consolidated financial information to be of crucial importance.
Abertis has a Training Plan for all of its employees, prepared by the Human Resources Department. The actions included in the Plan are linked to the Group's strategic objectives, as well as the Human Resources Department's strategy.
Abertis also considers that comprehensive, up-to-date training in relation to accounting rules and standards for preparing financial reporting, and capital market, tax and internal control regulations is necessary to ensure that the information reported to the markets is reliable and complies with current legislation.
With respect to the preparation and review of financial information, each year Abertis provides training in those areas identified by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department in relation to:
 New regulations adopted (accounting, tax, capital markets and internal control) and applicable to the Group.
 Changes in the reporting methodology and/or in the IT systems.
 Individual initiative of team members of the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department.
Once the training requirements in the aforementioned areas have been identified, appropriate training activities are designed and carried out to fulfil the Group's annual training objectives in these areas.
In 2018 Abertis provided training activities by external experts and in-house training sessions for the personnel involved in the preparation and review of the financial reporting at corporate and subsidiary level. Training in 2018 was focused mainly on the accounting, tax and financial areas that may have the greatest impact on the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial reporting, in particular, in relation to IT systems, changes in tax legislation and latest developments adopted during the year in accordance with the EU-IFRSs.
In addition, in 2018 specific training was provided in the following areas:
 Accounting training on "New accounting standards on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), first application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS16) given by the Consolidation and Accounting Regulations Department.
 Tax courses given by the Corporate Tax Department, in particular, on the latest tax developments in 2018 in the main countries in which Abertis has a presence and international taxation.
 Courses given by the Compliance Department, specifically:
o On-line training on the misuse of information for management personnel
o Face-to-face and online training in relation to the Abertis Group's compliance model (model of criminal prevention, prevention of corruption, advocacy lobby, conflicts of interest ...)

 Legal alerts prepared by the Legal Advisory Department on the latest amendments to legislation applicable to Group companies.
The Corporate Management Control and Planning Department has subscriptions to a number of publications and journals on accounting and financial matters and to the website of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which regularly sends new developments and other communications of interest which are analysed to ensure they are taken into consideration when preparing Abertis' financial information.
F.2 Assessment of financial reporting risks
Provide information on, at least:
F.2.1. The main features of the risk identification process, including risks of error or fraud, as regards:
 Whether the process exists and is documented:
Pursuant to the provisions of Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015, of 23 October, approving the Consolidated Securities Market Law and Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) Circular no. 7/2015, of 22 December, the Group has a system of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) model.
The aforementioned model is documented in the "Policy for identification of risk of error in financial reporting of the Abertis Group" ("Risk Identification Policy"), which describes the process for identifying risks of material error or fraud in relation to the consolidated financial statements. The risk identification process is performed at least once a year.
Through application of the Risk Identification Policy, Abertis ensures that the risk identification process considers quantitative and qualitative variables (i.e. transaction complexity, risk of fraud, regulatory compliance or level of judgement required) when defining the scope of the Group's ICFR system.
As a result of applying the Risk Identification Policy, an ICFR risk matrix is drawn up for the consolidated group. The purpose of the matrix is to identify the accounts and disclosures which have an associated significant risk with a potential material impact on financial reporting. Once the scope of application of the Group's ICFR system has been defined, based on the identified risk matrix, the control activities required to mitigate the identified risks are designed.
The process of identifying risks of error in financial reporting is performed and documented each year by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department.
 Whether the process covers all financial reporting objectives (existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; presentation, disclosure and comparability; and rights and obligations), is updated and how frequently.
The Risk Identification Policy establishes that, following identification, risks are reviewed in order to analyse the potential risks of error in each of the financial reporting elements

(existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; presentation, disclosure and comparability; and rights and obligations) that might have a significant impact on the reliability of the financial reporting.
The risks of error identified in the financial reporting are classified as follows:
a) General risks
b) Risks relating to appropriate recognition of the Group's specific transactions
a. Significant transactions b. Judgements and estimates c. Lack of familiarity with agreements/contracts d. Activities outsourced to third parties
c) Risks relating to the financial reporting preparation process
d) Risks relating to IT systems
Each of the aforementioned risks identified in the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements is associated with the processes and various financial areas deemed significant (in view of either their contribution to the consolidated financial statements or to other more qualitative factors) and to the Group companies within the scope of the ICFR system.
 Whether a specific process is in place to define the scope of consolidation, taking into account, inter alia, the possible existence of complex corporate structures, holding companies and special purpose vehicles.
The identification of the scope of consolidation is performed periodically to obtain an updated company map. Companies exercising direct or indirect control (power to govern the operating and financial policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities) are considered when establishing the companies within the scope of the ICFR system. Therefore, the scope of the ICFR system excludes companies over which joint or significant influence is exercised, although general controls are performed in order to provide assurance on the reliability of the financial reporting furnished by these companies and included in the consolidated financial statements.
 Whether the process addresses other types of risk (operational, technological, financial, legal, reputational, environmental, etc.) insofar as they may affect the financial statements.
Abertis considers the possibility of risks of error arising in certain processes not associated with specific types of transactions to the extent that they may impact the financial statements (such as the close process, the IT system operating process and the judgements or key accounting policies review process). These processes include the consolidation process and, accordingly, the Group has established policies geared towards ensuring both correct configuration and execution of the process, as well as correct identification of the scope of consolidation.

 Indicate the entity's governing body that oversees the process.
As mentioned above in F.1.1., the ACC is responsible for oversight of the internal control and risk management system with the support of the Internal Audit function.
F.3 Control activities
Provide information, indicating the salient features, if available, on at least:
F.3.1. Procedures for reviewing and authorising financial information and the description of the ICFR system to be disseminated in the securities markets, indicating the persons responsible in that connection, as well as documentation describing the flows of activities and controls (including those addressing the risk of fraud) for the various types of transactions that may have a material effect on the financial statements, including the accounting close procedure and the specific review of the relevant judgements, estimates, valuations and projections.
The Group's "Review, Authorisation and Supervision of Financial Reporting Policy" establishes, inter alia, the scope (periodic regulated financial reporting and those responsible for the preparation thereof) and the review procedures of the ACC, which include reading and analysis of the information and discussions with those responsible for its preparation (Corporate Management Control and Planning Department), those responsible for the verification of the design of the model and operation of the existing controls (Internal Audit) and the external auditors.
Responsibility in relation to the preparation of the financial information at each quarterly close begins with the review and certification of the person responsible for economic and financial matters at each subsidiary, and also, at the half-yearly and annual accounting closes, with the express certification of the general manager of each subsidiary. The aforementioned certification is provided by means of a questionnaire that includes the internal control procedures that must be performed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the entity's financial statements.
As regards the description of the ICFR system contained in this document, the review and certification process is the same as that applied for the rest of the economic and financial content of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
The separate and consolidated financial statements, the half-yearly financial reports and the financial information contained in the Group's quarterly interim management statements are prepared and reviewed by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department and the Financial Department prior to submission to the ACC. The ACC applies the procedures included in the policy referred to at the beginning of the section as a preliminary step towards the submission of its conclusions to the Board of Directors of Abertis.
The documentation of the ICFR system includes the following documents:

 ICFR system policies
 Corporate internal regulations
 ICFR system risk map
 ICFR system scope model
 ICFR system risk and control matrix
 Quarterly questionnaires certifying control activities
In addition to the ICFR system policies, Abertis has policies designed to mitigate the risks of error in processes not associated with specific transactions. Specifically, documented corporate internal regulations exist in relation to:
 Accounting close procedures (at both corporate level, including the consolidation process, and at subsidiary level)
 Procedures relating to activities performed by third parties
 Transfer pricing
 Policies to identify and establish levels of approval for significant judgements and estimates
In addition to the risks detected and documented in the "ICFR system risk and control matrix", the scope of the system of internal control over financial reporting is established in order to determine both the headings affected in the financial statements, as well as the companies affected (see section F.2.1.).
In relation to the activities and controls directly related to transactions that may materially affect the financial statements, the Group has descriptions of the controls implemented to mitigate the risk of material error in the information reported to the markets. The descriptions are also documented in the "ICFR system risk and control matrix" and contain information on what the control activity should entail, why it is executed, who is required to execute it and how often, as well as any other information with regard to which IT systems or which activities performed by third parties are relevant in terms of the effectiveness of the related control activity. The controls cover areas such as the generation of revenue, investments and concession expenses, acquisitions and subsequent measurement of other non-current assets, analysis of investment recovery, recognition of income taxes or correct presentation of financial instruments and of financing transactions of the Group. Abertis performs an annual review of matrices to ensure maintenance thereof.
The Group has descriptive corporate documentation available on the control activities that encompass all the financial reporting control objectives of the various types of transactions with a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In relation to relevant judgements and estimates, the Group provides information in its annual consolidated financial statements on particularly relevant areas of uncertainty. The specific review and approval of the significant judgements, estimates, valuations and projections, as well as the key assumptions used for their calculation, with a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, is carried out by General Financial Management and, where applicable, by the chief executive officer. The most significant, such as the monitoring of asset value, hedging policies, etc. are discussed and reviewed by the ACC, prior to their approval by the Board of Directors.

F.3.2. Internal control policies and procedures for IT systems (including secure access, tracking of changes, system operation, operational continuity and segregation of duties) giving support to key company processes regarding the preparation and publication of financial information.
The Group uses IT systems to maintain proper recognition and control of its transactions and, therefore, their correct functioning is a crucial element of particular importance to the Group. Specifically, it has implemented standardised accounting and reporting systems at the majority of the Group companies.
Accordingly, as part of the identification process for risks of error in financial reporting, the Group identifies, through its Corporate Management Control and Planning Department, which systems and applications are relevant to the preparation of the financial reporting. The systems and applications identified include those used directly at corporate level in the preparation of the consolidated financial reporting, as well as the reporting systems among the various Group companies. The systems and applications include, inter alia, both complex developments at integrated IT system level, as well as other software applications developed at user level (e.g. spreadsheets), when they are relevant to the activities involved in the preparation and control of financial reporting.
Also, the Systems Department has established general policies aimed at ensuring the correct operation of the systems and applications. These policies cover both physical and logical security relating to access, procedures to verify the design of new systems or changes to existing systems and data recovery policies in the event of unforeseen incidents affecting the operation thereof. In particular, documented policies exist in relation to the following:
 IT system project development methodology (change management, etc.)
 Operations management (backup management, patch installation, system capacity and performance management, communications management, interface monitoring, operational incident management and resolution, preventive updates and batch process management)
 Information and systems security (backup copy procedure and plan, user and licence management, physical access, security monitoring, etc.)
 Systems continuity plan
The Systems Department performs an annual validation of the effectiveness of the controls established over the various IT systems implemented at the Group.
F.3.3. Internal control policies and procedures for overseeing the management of activities outsourced to third parties and of the appraisal, calculation or valuation services commissioned from independent experts, when these may materially affect the financial statements.
Since 2015, some of the Group companies in Spain have outsourced to a third-party provider certain of the activities associated with economic and personnel management. In this

connection, certain risk control and management mechanisms have been established with the provider to ensure the completeness and reliability of the financial information arising from the outsourced activities, including, inter alia: a Management and Oversight Committee for the agreement, service level agreements, risk indicators, service reports, technological security measures, external audits and contingency and continuity plans.
Also, the Group uses, on a recurring basis, independent experts' reports to measure its financial instruments and employee benefit obligations.
The Corporate Finance Department and Compensation and Benefits Department carry out checks prior to hiring independent experts and following the experts' work, in order to verify:
 Competence, knowledge, credentials and independence;
 The validity of the data and methods used; and
 The reasonableness of the assumptions applied, where applicable.
Abertis has documented guidelines on the treatment of activities outsourced to third parties in terms of both engagement and results. These guidelines are set out in the "Procedure for activities performed by third parties" policy.
Each year the Group reviews which activities performed by third parties are relevant to the preparation of the financial reporting.
F.4 Reporting and communication
Provide information, indicating the salient features, if available, on at least:
F.4.1. Whether there is a specific role in charge of defining and keeping upto-date accounting policies (accounting policies area or department) and resolving doubts or disputes over their interpretation, communicating on a regular basis with the team in charge of operations at the organisation. The role is also responsible for updating the accounting policies manual and disseminating it to the operating units.
This responsibility is held by Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management (reporting to the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department) which, among other duties, is in charge of defining, keeping up-to-date and communicating the Group's accounting policies for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial information in accordance with the standards adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) (and, consequently, of the information each subsidiary is required to report).
The Group has formalised a "Procedure for the preparation, updating and communication of accounting policies" which sets out the following:
 Existence of a Group accounting manual
 Update frequency
 Communication with business units

 Procedure for receiving and responding to queries regarding the accounting manual (Accounting legislation mailbox)
 Procedure for updating the Reporting Package of accounting information to be received from subsidiaries
The duties of Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management also include responding to the accounting consultations that may be made by the various business units and other corporate departments of the Group.
As mentioned in section F.1.2, the Group has an accounting policy manual (GRAPH) for the purposes of preparing the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs), which is compiled by Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management and updated periodically (as least once a year), and includes the standards applicable during the year. The Audit Instructions sent by the external auditor to all the auditors of the various Group companies for the limited review or audit at each half-yearly or annual close, respectively, establish that the accounting policies to be applied in the performance of their work are those contained in Abertis' GRAPH.
Any amendments made are communicated to the subsidiaries by email, and a complete, updated manual is available in the Accounting Legislation Portal and in the Corporate Management Control Portal on the Group intranet. The manual was last updated in September 2018 and, in any event, is reviewed in the last quarter to verify that no significant amendments have been made that might affect the preparation of the consolidated financial information for the year.
Moreover, on a half-yearly basis, Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management issues an information memorandum on the EU-IFRSs, which describes the standards that will come into force during the year and in future years, as well as a summary of the standards not yet approved that might have an impact on the consolidated financial statements and those of the subsidiaries.
F.4.2. Mechanisms in standard format for the capture and preparation of financial information, which are applied and used in all units within the company or group, and support its main financial statements and accompanying notes as well as disclosures concerning the ICFR system.
The Group has various integrated platforms both for the accounting recognition of transactions and the preparation of financial information for the majority of its subsidiaries (SAP R3·and BPC consolidation and reporting). The integrity and reliability of the aforementioned IT systems is validated through the general controls indicated in section F.3.2.
Also, each of the subsidiaries is responsible for the preparation and upload in the reporting and corporate consolidation system (SAP BPC) of the monthly reporting, which contains the financial information required at each monthly close to prepare the consolidated information and other financial information required.
The monthly reporting is a single reporting based on a standard chart of accounts for all the Group companies.
Every six and twelve months "Half-yearly forms/Annual forms" (a single, standard information package for all the Group companies, which includes the monthly reporting and a reporting of "Additional Information - Financial Statements 2018") signed by the General Management of each of the subsidiaries are received, which include all the information required to prepare the Group's consolidated financial information (interim condensed financial statements).

The aforementioned "Half-yearly and annual forms" ensure the uniformity of the information by virtue of the following characteristics:
 It is unified and consistent across countries and lines of business.
 It is prepared based on the Group instructions and accounting manual, which are unique to all the companies forming part of the Group.
 It includes the applicable legal, tax, corporate and regulatory requirements. Information on monthly reporting and forms is uploaded directly by the controllers to the reporting and corporate consolidation system. The structure of the forms is reviewed regularly (at least twice a year) to ensure that all the regulatory updates applicable in accordance with EU-IFRSs are included. The entire reporting system is included in the Monthly Reporting Information Manual, which is updated each year by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department and provides details of processes, dates and full information on how to complete the reporting, which should be adhered to by all the Group companies.
F.5 Oversight of system operation
Provide information, indicating the salient features, on at least:
F.5.1. ICFR system monitoring activities performed by the Audit Committee, including an indication of whether the entity has an internal audit department whose competencies include supporting the Audit Committee in its role of monitoring the internal control system, including ICFR. Also describe the scope of the ICFR system assessment conducted in the year and the procedure for the person in charge to communicate the findings. State also whether the company has an action plan specifying corrective measures and whether it has taken stock of the potential impact on its financial information:
In 2018 the ACC or, in its absence, the Board of Directors performed the following activities in relation to the ICFR system:
 Periodical review of the financial information, considering the most relevant judgments and estimates.
 Periodical monitoring of the certifications of the application of controls by the personnel responsible for preparing the financial reporting.
 Monitoring of the findings of the internal and external audit ICFR reviews.

 Review of the information relating to the ICFR system forming part of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
The Group has an Internal Audit function (forming part of the General Secretary's Office and Corporate Affairs) that reports to the ACC (which delegates oversight of internal control systems, including the ICFR system). As a result of the supervisory tasks delegated to it, Internal Audit plays a key role in ensuring an internal control system is in place that reasonably guarantees:
 Safeguarding of the Group's assets
 Compliance with applicable external and internal regulations
 Effectiveness and efficiency in the transactions and corporate and support activities
 Transparency and completeness of the financial and management information
Internal Audit draws up an Annual Review Plan that is approved by the ACC and based on the following:
 The classification, by risk and materiality factors, of the companies controlled by the Group.
 The definition of the activities to be reviewed: top-level transactional processes (revenue, procurements, fixed assets, employees, financial management, technology, etc.), other transactional processes (travel, maintenance and warehouse expenses, etc.) and compliance (ICFR, etc.).
 The definition of the frequency of the reviews for each of the foregoing processes based on the company classification.
In relation to the financial information and the general model of the SCIIF, in 2018 a review was made on the operation of the controls on relevant operations, judgments and estimates and preparation of the financial information. Likewise, reviews have been carried out on the controls of general risks and information systems that are reviewed by applying the periodicity determined by the general review criteria of Internal Audit.
The potential weaknesses identified in all of the reviews are classified by criticality, assigned to a supervisor and subject to monitoring until they are resolved.
As a result of the ICFR assessment activities conducted by the Internal Audit function in 2018, which were submitted to the ACC, no material weaknesses were detected which might have a material impact on the Group's financial reporting for 2018, and the corrective measures required to resolve other potential weaknesses in the future having been implemented.
Also, the external auditor, as mentioned in section F.7.1., issues an annual agreed-upon procedures report on the description of the ICFR system prepared by Abertis in which no matters worthy of note arose.
F.5.2. Indicate whether there is a discussion procedure whereby the financial auditor (pursuant to TSAs), the internal audit department and other experts can report any significant internal control weaknesses encountered during their review of the financial statements or other reviews they have been

engaged to perform to the company's senior executives and its Audit Committee or Board of Directors. State also whether the entity has an action plan to correct or mitigate the weaknesses identified.
As indicated above in section F.3.1, Abertis' "Review, Authorisation and Supervision of Financial Reporting Policy" establishes the ACC's review procedure which includes the following:
 Meetings with those responsible for the preparation of the financial reporting (Corporate Management Control and Planning Department) to discuss the reasonableness of the changes in the aggregates, the most significant transactions or events during the period, changes in accounting policies, any unusual fluctuations and any other information deemed relevant.
 Discussions with the Internal Audit function (as part of the ongoing monitoring of reviews and recommendations made throughout the year) to obtain information on the level of compliance with the Plan and with the findings of the reviews performed (including ICFR) and on the current status of any recommendations made to improve the potential weaknesses identified.
 Private discussions with the external auditors (at least on completion of the planning phase of the audit of the financial statements for the year and on completion of their audit and/or limited review procedures on the financial statements and the half-yearly reporting) in order to obtain information on the scope and findings of their work and on any potential significant internal control weaknesses identified, the content of their reports and any other information deemed appropriate.
F.6 Other relevant information
No additional aspects were identified for disclosure.
F.7 External auditor's report
Indicate:
F.7.1. Whether the ICFR system information reported to the markets has been reviewed by the external auditor. If "yes", the related report should be included in the corresponding report as an Appendix. If "no", give reasons.
The external auditor reviewed Abertis' ICFR information that was reported for 2018. The scope of the auditor's review procedures was set in accordance with the Spanish Institute of Certified Public Accountants Circular E14/2013, of 19 July 2013, publishing the Draft Guidance and specimen auditor's report relating to the information on the system of internal control over the financial information (ICFR) of listed entities.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Marcelino Fernández Verdes Chairman

José Aljaro Navarro Chief Executive Officer

After completing the shareholding structure transformation following the takeover bids on the company that started in the first half of 2017, Abertis began a new phase in 2018.
The Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting approved the appointment of the new Abertis's Board of Directors on 10 December 2018. The Group thus embarked on a new period with the impulse of its three new shareholders, Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief, to continue growing and developing a global leadership project in the infrastructure field.
From now on, Abertis' new management will work on a strategic revision process of the company to identify improvement areas and synergies, in order to continue creating value and taking advantage as well of the international presence and market knowledge of the new shareholders.
This new phase will be oriented to growth, yet without overlooking the financial discipline for which the Group is renowned. The company will reinforce its growth strategy in countries with stable frameworks for concessions and a clear commitment to developing public-private partnerships in the toll road sector.
SOLID FIGURES
In 2018, the traffic on the Group's toll road network continued its positive trend, with a particular increase in Spain and France. There was also a recovery in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in 2017. Chile and India also reported remarkably positive growth this year.
Abertis's results have been improved in 2018, with a 1,682 Mn net profit (+87% comparing to 2017). This result has been boosted mostly by the impact of the 605 million of capital gains obtained after the sale of 34% stake of Cellnex Telecom. Without this effect, the net profit grows 15% on a like-for-like basis.
As a world reference in the toll road management industry, road safety is a priority for Abertis. In this regard, the Group posted improvements during 2018 in terms of accident rate (-6% versus the previous year) and fatality (-10%). There was also a salient decrease in the number of road accident deaths (-8.7%). This all stemmed from the extensive efforts to improve prevention and safety in all the countries.
AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTS
In 2018, Abertis continued furthering its growth strategy based on existing assets. During the year, the Group closed two agreements with the government of Argentina

P r e s e n t a t i o n | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis
Abertis' new management will work on a strategic revision process of the company to identify

to extend the concession for its subsidiaries Autopista del Sol (Ausol) and Grupo Concesionario del Oeste (GCO), in exchange for a global investment plan that will be financed with the future revenues thanks to the extension of the contracts.
Also the subsidiary VíasChile reached an agreement with the Chilean government to carry out further investments in Autopista del Sol (Route 78) in exchange for an almost two-year extension in the duration of the concession. The extensive investment plan in view aims to not only resolve problems caused by the increase in traffic over recent years but also improve traffic flow and road safety.
For Abertis, the closing of these deals means reinforcing its commitment to publicprivate partnerships with a view to providing solutions that create value for the future in the regions where Abertis has a presence through agreements with the public administrations to engage in new investments by extending concessions or improving tariffs. Doing so also demonstrates the Group's ability to continue growing its current asset portfolio and to extend the average duration of its concessions.
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
In line with its committment to support the principles of the Global Compact over a decade now, Abertis has publicly and formally renewed its commitment to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda). It is worth noting the organisation's contribution to achieving Goals 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) through Road Safety and Road Tech strategic programmes that coordinate innovations in road safety and infrastructures for a more sustainable mobility.
The Group also continued working on deploying the Corporate Social Responsibility Master Plan and achieving the objectives and goals established in all countries in 2018.
Abertis is one of the world's leading toll road operators in terms of kilometres managed, with nearly 8,200 kilometres of high-capacity roads, and operations in 15 countries across Europe, America and Asia. Thanks to the joint efforts of over 14,000 employees, the Group has a solid foundation to face the challenges of the future with rigour and confidence. Financial strength, industrial excellence and long-term vision make Abertis a key piece in the search for solutions to one of the world's biggest challenges: the sustainable management of infrastructures of the future.

OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY CHALLENGES

OPPORTUNITIES

Industry trends and challenges will shed light on the future prospects for the business in the coming years

ROADWAY INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT
The global infrastructure deficit is estimated in terms of billions of dollars, and a huge part of that corresponds to road transport infrastructures. There will be new public procurement opportunities abound for not only new motorways in developing markets such as India or Latin America but also improvements on existing motorways in mature markets such as Europe, North America and Australia.
GENERATING FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Road transport entails multiple costs: construction, maintenance, congestion and pollution. At a juncture where investments in infrastructure have become essential to bolster economies, the private sector is capable of contributing to the necessary investment in infrastructures and pay-per-use with toll roads could be a way to transfer demand risks in infrastructure projects.
NEW PAYMENT SYSTEMS
Barrier-free (free-flow) toll systems are a growing demand in light of their potential advantages in terms of reducing travel time, curbing pollution and simplifying payment.
DIGITALISATION AND CONNECTIVITY
Road must incorporate new digital components such as wireless network technologies, digitalisation, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which will be vital for better managing the new generation of autonomous and connected vehicles.
MOBILITY AS A SERVICE (MAAS)
Big data and the collaborative economy are driving mobility as a service, a new paradigm shift in user-centric transport. This new way of understanding mobility establishes a closer link between supply and demand, in which users seek the greatest efficiency in their travel decisions.

S t r a t e g y | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis
CHALLENGES
TRAFFIC GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Road traffic growth (fourfold increase in the number of vehicles worldwide expected by 2050) will entail significant challenges such as pollution, congestion and other externalities on road safety and public health. New ways of managing traffic are also muscling in to achieve safer and more sustainable and efficient mobility.
GAUGING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION
The uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic situation, price collapse concerning raw materials and additional elements such as the gridlock in investment and the sluggishness of productivity can also contribute in discouraging consumption and shipping on motorways.
INCREASED COMPETITION
The new international players that have been cropping up in recent years are targeting assets such as toll roads, particularly regarding infrastructure investment and pension funds. Characterised by low interest rates, the present scenario has been an impetus for these funds to increasingly invest more in infrastructure assets because of their attractive returns.
REGULATION AND LEGAL SECURITY
Most of the Group's businesses are done as term-based concessions base on agreements with the public sector entailing the mandate to ensure concessional obligations and acquired investment commitments. The legal certainty that protects bilateral contracts is a cornerstone in this sector.
MEETING SOCIETY'S NEW EXPECTATIONS
Toll road clients and stakeholders have new expectations, including yet not limited to services, customer care, new technologies, transparency and flexibility.

GROWTH OPERATIONS IN 2018
Abertis drives growth through three lines of action: growth based on existing assets, new acquisitions and public-private partnerships.
GROWTH IN THE EXISTING ASSET PORTFOLIO
In January, the Abertis Group spent 33 million to acquire an additional 6.47% stake of A4 Holding, which manages the A4 and A31 toll roads in northern Italy. With this transaction, Abertis concluded the different agreements reached in 2017 to acquire minority shares in its subsidiary A4 reaching over 90% of its capital through an overall investment of 212 million between 2017 and 2018.
Abertis also paid 15 million in 2018 to acquire an additional 26% in the Indian concessionaire Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL), which in turns holds the concession of the NH-44 toll road in Telangana State. This was Abertis' final transaction to obtain 100% of JEPL, thus reinforcing its commitment to the Indian market.
These deals constitute yet another step by Abertis towards attaining a more balanced global portfolio, growing in economies with stable frameworks for concessions and a clear commitment to public-private partnerships in the toll road sector.
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS
In January 2018, VíasChile, jointly owned by Abertis (80%) and ADIA (20%), secured authorisation from the Chilean government to invest further in Autopista del Sol (Route 78) in exchange for an almost two-year extension in the duration of the concession.
These new investments, which will total nearly 110 million, consist of a new third lane to expand the toll road between Santiago de Chile and Talagante, and additional construction projects. The extensive investment plan for the entire toll

S t r a t e g y | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis

road aims to not only resolve problems caused by the increase in traffic over recent years but also improve traffic flow and road safety. The construction is expected to be completed by 2020.
In exchange, the concession period for Autopista del Sol is extended by 22 months till 2021. Autopista del Sol is the main route connecting Santiago de Chile with San Antonio, the country's largest maritime port, whose area of influence spans from central Chile to Argentina's Mendoza Province.
This agreement further strengthens Abertis' commitment to public-private partnerships with a view to achieving future value creation solutions for its territories through agreements with the public sector for new investments in exchange for extending the duration of concessions or via tariff increases.
In July 2018, the Abertis Group closed two agreements with the Argentine government to extend the concession for its subsidiaries in Autopista del Sol (Ausol) and Grupo Concesionario del Oeste (GCO), in exchange for a global investment plan amounting near $680 million (approximately 584 million).
Both concessionaires announced in 2017 that they would formally open renegotiations with the Ministry of Transport for their respective concession arrangements to recognise the pending rebalancing. By virtue of these agreements, the Abertis Group will improve the current road network to carry out an investment plan of around $430 million (approximately 369 million) for the Ausol network and around $250 million (approximately 215 million) for the GCO network. The plan will be financed by the future revenue from the concession thanks to the extended expiration of the present contracts until 2030.
For Abertis, entering these agreements means reinforcing its commitment to public-private partnerships that the company is promoting with a view to providing solutions that create value for the future in the regions where it operates through arrangements with the public sector, similar to the ones made in Argentina, to engage in new investments by extending concessions or improving rates.
The Group entered into major agreements in this regard in all the countries where it carries out activities, including France (committed investment of 750 million), Italy (1,500 million), Brazil (2,000 million), Chile (800 million), Puerto Rico (125 million) and, in this case, Argentina (approximately 584 million). Entry into these agreements demonstrates the Group's ability to continue growing its current asset portfolio and extend the average duration of its concessions.
PERMANENT SEARCH FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Abertis analyses all growth projects under a strict financial discipline from the perspective of the Group's renown industrial role. In this regard, the Group only takes on projects that entail zero risks for the Group's dividend policy and financial strength.
Notwithstanding the duty of passivity in public tender offers on Abertis, the company continued its daily activities in 2018. In 2018, the Abertis Business Development Area analysed 17 projects in 11 countries.

STRATEGIC APPROACH
FOCUS
Alligned with the strategy of becoming a pure toll road operator, in 2018 Abertis closed the sale of 34% stake in Cellnex Telecom, through a accelerated placement of shares and the sale of the rest of the stake to ConnecT S.p.A, subsidiary of Edizione S.r.l. in consequence, the Abertis Group is no longer a Cellnex Telecom shareholder. The sale of the entire stake of Cellnex generated a 605 million capital gains for Abertis.
EFFICIENCY
After concluding the three-year efficiencies plan for 2015-2017 (focusing on the Group's businesses in France, Brazil and Spain) with accumulated savings of 416 million, the Group intends to continue striding forward in continuation of the work it has been carrying out in recent years not only in the Corporation but also in several business units with a view to consolidate and improve the EBITDA margin of each Group business unit.
SHAREHOLDER REMUNERATION
On 13 March 2018, the Abertis General Shareholders' Meeting approved the distribution of a second and final payment on the 2017 dividend against available voluntary reserves at 0.40 per share (gross), which became effective in March 2018.

S t r a t e g y | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis
CSR MASTER PLAN
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and materiality analysis are the cornerstones of the CSR Master Plan
IMPLEMENTATION
The Board of Directors handles the coordination of matters concerning Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors, which the corporation's CSR Unit implements by conducting deployment of the CSR Master Plan. The implementation and execution of actions are delegated to each country by designating a coordinator to handle them together with the direct involvement of the operational teams related to the different material ESG factors. Work on integration of the CSR Master Plan continued throughout 2018 in every country according to the local particulars and possibilities of contributing to the established objectives and targets. At the strategic level, CSR Master Plan objectives and targets were incorporated into the Project Management Standard drawn up in 2018. The appraisal of the Abertis Strategic Goals established within the organisation's strategic plan will enable us to ascertain the environmental, social and corporate governance factors to be considered for not only fulfilling the CSR Master Plan but also adapting and updating it according to Abertis' new strategic plan. . The Annexe attached thereto contains further performance-related data broken down by activity and country for each strategic target in the CSR Master Plan.
ASSESSMENT AND TRACKING
A formal annual assessment will be made of the main environmental, social and corporate governance indicators in relation to the goals set in the CSR Master Plan, though some specific indicators are permanently monitored by individual countries. External assessment are a crucial element in assessing the Group's ESG performance and the agents that conduct such assessments differ. Assessments related to listed companies fall outside the scope of the organisation because they are not traded on the stock market. Even though Abertis was assessed in 2018 under the parameters of the FTSE4Good and DJSI indices, these assessments may not be available to the organisation while exclude from securities markets such as the STOXX ESG index families. However, participation is possible in other initiatives such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, where the corresponding questionnaire was made for another year in addition to further assessments whose universal selection criteria exclude unlisted organisations, namely the assessments conducted by MSCI and Corporate Knights.

The change in the shareholding structure has resulted in a renewed Board of Directors
RENEWAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Abertis' change in its shareholding structure in the aftermath of the takeover launched by Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief resulted in a new Abertis' Board of Directors, whose appointments were approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 10 December 2018. Following these changes, the company's new Board of Directors is constitued by five members: José Aljaro, Carlo Bertazzo, Giovanni Castellucci, Marcelino Fernández Verdes and Pedro López Jiménez. Consequently, the number of members of the Board of Directors was reduced from 9 to 5 in order to simplify the Corporate Governance Structure and to keep with Good Governance Recommendations.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS Marcelino Fernández Verdes Chairman José Aljaro Navarro Chief Executive Officer Carlo Bertazzo Director Giovanni Castellucci Director Pedro López Jiménez Director
*On 10 December 2018, the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. voted to amend the Company Bylaws to adapt them to the new corporate reality following the delisting of the representative shares of the entire share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. from Spanish stock markets. Likewise, and because of the company's new shareholding structure, the cited Extraordinary General Meeting also voted to amend the composition of the company's Board of Directors, in which regard article 23.c) of the Bylaws states that the Board of Directors may constitute any specialised Committees that it deems necessary and expressly mentions the Audit, Appointments and Remuneration Committee. In light of the foregoing, the Board of Directors has yet to constitute the corresponding Committees as of 31 December 2018, though it is expected to do so within the coming months.

ROAD SAFETY PROGRAMME
Our ambition is to reach the zero fatalities in all our toll roads with 100% safe high-quality roads.
Road accidents have an elevated toll for society in terms of not only economic costs but also the unnecessary loss of lives and their impact on the families of the victims.
We understand that it is a global problem and we want to contribute our know-how and experience to tackle this challenge, which is already one of the Millennium Development Goals.
Cross-cutting teams from all disciplines and areas are working together in the Group's global road safety programme to ensure the knowledge and application of the best practices in road safety on Abertis' toll roads.

S a f e a n d i n n o v a t i v e r o a d s | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis

As a result of this strategy, the main units of the Group have continuously improved their accident and fatality rates in recent years.
Abertis works on a vision of road safety that shares the values of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, focusing on five pillars, namely safe infrastructures, road safety management, safer vehicles, safer users and post-crash response.

100% SAFE ROADS
Abertis brings more than 60 years of knowledge and experience in road construction and management with the highest quality standards. The Abertis Group abides to the most recognized policies and procedures in the industry to ensure road safety in all areas of our activity.
BEST PRACTICES INITIATIVES
 Arteris (Brazil) commissioned the duplication project in Serra do Cafezal, a project to double the capacity of the Régis Bittencourt toll road in São Paulo State that stands as one of the most complex engineering projects in the country. This ambitious expansion project was conceived to increase safety and traffic flow levels and adopted a series of measures to execute the work with the least environmental impact possible, since it crossed through a highly sensitive ecological zone. The Discovery Channel filmed a documentary in 2018 on the inner-workings of the construction process.
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION BEST PRACTICES INITIATIVES
· Improvement of the connection with the Mataró Oeste junction on the C-32 to streamline traffic and improve safety.
· Installation of cardio-respiratory protection devices in tunnels.
· Road refurbishment to improve safety. · Signalling improvements in toll road construction areas.
· S afety improvements for Regis Bittencourt and Litoral Sur with the construction of safety areas. · Installation of LED lighting at Litoral Sul and Fernão Dias. · D oubling of the SP-191 between Rio Claro and Araras to improve traffic flow and safety. · Use of high-visibility cones for construction work signalling.
· Repaving of toll roads A4 and A31 with sound-absorbing draining asphalt and implementation of new sensors and security cameras.
· Installation of new speed radars.
· Improvement of signalling at crossings and intersections.
· P hase II of the demolition process of conventional toll booths after the implementation of 100% free flow system.
· Improvement of passive safety elements

OPTIMUM SAFETY MANAGEMENT
In 2018, efforts were made to standardise best internal practices across all Group units to formulate a global vision on road safety. The Group has continued promoting employee training on road safety to ensure the best operation and maintenance through drills at most concessions.
 Autopistas held two drills: one of an accident involving a lorry carrying hazardous materials on the AP-7 and the other a fire in the Palafolls tunnel on the C-32.
 A special test was carried out in Chile with smoke in five tunnel ventilation systems in the country.
AGREEMENTS FOR SAFER MOBILITY
Abertis joined Waze's Connected Citizens Programme, a pioneering social navigation application and mobile technology that offers free real-time traffic information, fed by the largest community of drivers in the world. The Group works with Waze in seven countries (Spain, France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico) to improve traffic information and road safety.
Abertis uses the application as a sensor to understand traffic in real time and as an additional channel to provide its customers with information on traffic conditions, construction areas and even the presence of workers on the roads. The company also receives anonymous information in real time directly from the source: the drivers.
 In 2018 Sanef (France) incorporated the presence of company workers on the roads with a view to preventing occupational accidents such as the one in 2017.
PREDICTIVE APPROACH
· P roprietary management software that monitors the conditions of pavements, structures and retaining walls.
· Independent safety controls: in addition to the internal control systems, the Abertis Group works with independent entities such as the iRAP Foundation (International Road Assessment Program), which conducts road safety audits.
IRAP is a non-profit institution based in the United Kingdom dedicated to saving lives on the road. They develop scientific methodology and predictive tools recognised by higher-level institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, etc., with projects in over 80 countries.
Abertis was the first private toll road operator to cooperate at the global level with iRAP. This methodology lets Abertis ascertain the level of safety of its toll roads in a standardised and highly professional manner, identifying all areas of improvement that can help define the Group's future investment plans.

52 | 53

ROAD SAFETY

 VíasChile teamed up with the Institute of Complex Engineering Systems at the University of Chile to develop a cutting edge accident prediction model for Autopistas Central. For 4 years now, the project has been in place along 2 kilometres of Autopista Central as a test and seeks to forestall risk situations and alert users promptly, leveraging many possibilities offered by real-time information collected by the toll road's electronic systems. The company is presently examining the possibility of also applying it to other concessions in the country.
POST-CRASH RESPONSE
The Group continues working on providing the best solutions in response to accidents. Our recent innovations include advanced intelligent transport systems and an application that automatically detects irregular situations in tunnels.
 Thorough controls were made in Argentina on the ambulance arrival time for the purpose of engaging improvement actions.
 In Spain, the "Autopistas en Ruta" mobile application includes an emergency call function with the European 112 number.

S a f e a n d i n n o v a t i v e r o a d s | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis
SAFER USERS
In addition to our focus on infrastructures, Abertis also makes special effort to our customers through studies and observatories to know better the driving habits of road users, and through awareness campaigns.
DRIVING OBSERVATORIES
The Observatories enable us to study the habits of drivers along our toll roads. The drawn conclusions and processed data let us adapt our actions and road safety awareness-raising campaigns to the most common driving behaviours.  In 2018, Abertis presented the findings of its first Global Observatory regarding the behaviour of drivers on the Group's toll roads. This study compiles the aggregate data from observatories on the driving habits of Abertis customers in 2017 throughout 6 countries of the Group's network: Spain, France, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico.  In addition, Autopistas published its first Heavy Vehicle Driver Behaviour Study with a view to raising user awareness and reduce the number of incidents while improving safety for this group of drivers.

ROAD SAFETY FORUMS
Backed by its business units, Abertis brings its Road Safety Forums to countries as a space for debate with industry experts. In 2018, the Abertis Group has added Spain, France, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Chile and Puerto Rico to the network of countries hosting these International Road Safety Forums. These forums are conceived to generate a forum where authorities, road safety experts and transportation professionals can address the latest trends in road accident prevention and debate how the public and private sector can work together to help reduce traffic accidents.

PARTNERSHIP WITH UNICEF FOR A SAFE JOURNEY TO SCHOOL

UNICEF and Abertis have an innovative three-year partnership agreement to tackle the main cause of death in school-age children: road accidents.
This partnership aims to strengthen and scale up UNICEF's existing work to protect children on the world's roads and provide a safe journey to school.
The Abertis-UNICEF project focuses on high-risk schools in medium-to-low income countries where the child accident rate is one of their major problems. The overall priorities include the creation of safe areas around schools (zebra crossings, signalling, etc.), promoting road safety

and bolstering institutional partnership at different levels through awareness-raising campaigns.
Within the framework of this agreement, Abertis incorporated a new area of collaboration with the Institut Guttmann, which will combine the best practices of the three institutions in the prevention of injuries in traffic accidents involving children. Two medical teams from the Institut Guttmann specialising in the treatment of neurological injuries (spinal cord injuries and acquired brain damage) will travel to different countries to carry out training sessions and advise local doctors on best practices in the prevention and treatment of injuries sustained in traffic accidents.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Forty-one percent (49.2%) of turnover for toll roads, including Spain (except for Túnels) Chile, Argentina (Ausol is undergoing a certification process) and Brazil (ViaPaulista), has a road safety system in accordance with international standard ISO 39001. This system is expected to be implemented gradually in all the other countries.

INNOVATIVE ROADS
SOLUTIONS FOR SMART ROADS AND INTEGRATED MOBILITY:
· C -Roads: EU-backed project that analyses the possibilities of intelligent systems in cooperative transport and autonomous driving systems. One of its five projects in Spain is at the Mediterranean Corridor along several sections of the AP-7 toll road for Autopistas (Spain). Its main purpose is to check the functioning of C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems) services on toll roads. Both Autopistas (Spain) and Sanef (France) participate in this project.
· V 2I Connectivity (Vehicle to Infrastructure): Autopistas (Spain) is working on the development and implementation of advanced communication solutions applied to mobility between vehicles and infrastructures. In Italy, A4 Holding participates in the Smart Road Project, a pilot program to equip 10 km of toll roads with road units for DSRC (Dedicated short-range communications) in the 5.9Ghz frequency range for traffic and safety information. We are studying the possibility of installing fibre optics and providing connection along the entire corridor in Puerto Rico.
· Implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT): A4 Holding (Italy) is researching the connectivity of different sensors and network technology to monitor infrastructure conditions. Sanef (France) is also working with an IoT sensor system to improve service and optimise operations. France's first stretch of toll road fully equipped with connected solutions was completed in the Reims region. The project, which involves the installation of 250 IoT devices, will optimise toll road operation and maintenance equipment routes, and improve service quality.

58 | 59

ROAD TECH
· Wireless connections: Several Group concessionaires such as ViasChile, A4Holding (Italy) and Sanef (France) are deploying Wi-Fi connections across the network. In Brazil, the new Via Paulista will have Wi-Fi coverage throughout its entire length as a communications system between users and the concessionaire.
SOLUTIONS FOR CONNECTED AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES:
· SCOOP@F: project involving the deployment of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) in 3,000 vehicles and 2,000 km of roads to exchange information on traffic conditions. As part of this project, Sanef (France) collaborated with Renault to improve the range of autonomous cars in construction works and toll lane passing zones.
· Inframix: this 3-year research project of the European Commission was designed to evaluate the future role of infrastructures during the period of coexistence between conventional and autonomous vehicles, with the aim of making roads faster, safer and socially sustainable for all traffic participants. Autopistas (Spain) offered a 20 km section of the AP-7 toll road to conduct tests in the three priority components of the project: dynamic lane allocation, construction zones, traffic jams and congestion.
SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES:
· F abric: Sanef (France) and 22 partners are studying the feasibility and development of wireless road charging solutions for electric vehicles. We are analysing the technological developments required in pavements and the operational restrictions after implementation.
· E-way corridor: a project for experimenting with an electric toll road corridor for heavy vehicles. The tests are being carried out in the Seine Valley's A13 toll road. The French Abertis subsidiary Sanef has partnered with other companies to analyse which of the different solutions (power rail, induction or direct contactless charging) will be more easily applicable in the future.
· C orri-door (France): a consortium of multiple agents, namely EDF, Sodetrel, Renault, Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, ParisTech and toll road operators, including Sanef, joining forces to develop electric vehicles. The project entails installing fast-charging electric devices across France's road network, making chargers available every 80 km so users can charge 80% of the battery in 30 minutes.

MAIN PROJECTS IN 2018
 S anef began installing France's first free flow gantry in 2018 the A4 in Boulay. The two tollgates along the toll road to Boulay were replaced with free flow gates. They are equipped with lasers, cameras and signals to detect and classify vehicles, read licence plates and record transactions. The system is set to be commissioned in February 2019.

ROAD TECH
 Conceived from the 'Chile Sin Barreras' (Barrier-free Chile) government initiative, VíasChile signed an agreement with the Chilean government to migrate from the tollbooths to a free-flow barrier-less teletoll system on Rutas del Pacifico. This implementation is scheduled to finish by mid-2019. The company also expects to commence the installation work on this type of barrier-less tolls on routes 78 and 57.
EMOVIS
Abertis offers advisory services, design, implementation, operation and maintenance of free-flow mobility solutions through Emovis, its technology and services division. The division operates some of the world's largest electronic toll infrastructures in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada. It has activities in 7 countries, namely Canada, United States, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Croatia.
 In 2018, Emovis and the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) signed a twoyear extension for the operation of Dublin's M50 toll road. until March 2021. Barrier-less toll management on M50, the first free-flow toll road installed in Europe, has been under Emovis operation for ten years. Traffic has grown over this decade by 63% to 143,000 transactions. M50 is integrated within the Interoperability Management Services Provider (IMSP), an interoperability system for e-toll payments on several toll roads in the country, also managed by Emovis.
 E movis has kicked off the Washington Road User Charge (WARUC) pilot project. Over 12 months, 2,000 volunteers will participate in this pilot to study the replacement of the fuel rate with a road usage charge rate. Drivers will simulate payment per miles driven instead of gallons of gasoline bought. The results of this trial will help define the future transport financing policy for Washington State. Emovis has also been participating in similar US initiatives, including a similar pilot in Oregon State and in Europe.
 Emovis has also executed the engineering project for the back office of the first Truck Tolling (heavy vehicles exclusive e-toll system) in Rhode Island (USA). Emovis contributed with an innovative enforcement module that lets the administration recover outstanding tolls from lorries registered in another State, including cross-border carriers from Canada, to ensure an elevated payment collection rate.
 Q ueen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the Mersey Gateway Bridge operated by Emovis. The Abertis technology and services subsidiary was commissioned to handle design, implementation and, from last October, management of the free-flow tolling solution. The Mersey Gateway Bridge is an important communication axis between northwest England and the rest of the country. It is considered one of the 40 main projects of the National Infrastructure Plan, and one of the 100 main infrastructure projects in the world in the last few years.

 E movis is also participating in research at the Centre for London, the Mayor of London's Think Tank created to find solutions to the capital city's mobility challenges. A new transport arrangement for the city will be promoted following publication of the study in the spring of 2019.
INTEROPERABILITY AND PAYMENT DEVICES
The Abertis Group works to make road travel a comfortable and easy experience for customers.
 E urotoll continues increasing interoperability for its Tribox Air device as a single device for travelling through France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Belgium and soon also Germany. Eurotoll was certified to operate with Viapass (Belgium) and REETS Asfinag (Austria) in 2018. The company provides its customers with added-value services such as geotracking, long-distance monitoring, etc.
 Bip&Drive, the e-toll payment device issuer in which Abertis has a holding, has solidified its leadership in the Spanish market, reaching 875,000 customers and surpassing a market share of 30%. In 2018, Bip&Drive launched a new app that incorporates payments at service, petrol, vehicle technical inspection and e-charging stations.
 T hrough its payment devices issuer Autopase,VíasChile has also made progress in the field of interoperability among the division's concessionaries in the country.
ADVANCED PAYMENT SYSTEMS
The Abertis Group continues innovating in the field of payment systems and models.
 Centrovias (Arteris) implemented the OCR technology used as the toll collection system. In case of a reading error, the system recognises the registration plate and authorises vehicle passage. The sponsor ARTESP has recognised this initiative, which is being replicated by federal Arteris concessionaries, as an innovative project.
 In Argentina, the company launched the PIM-toll prepaid teletoll system developed in partnership with Banco de la Nación Argentina to be able to associate virtual wallets with mobile phones. The mobile phone is used to sign up to the system by associating the TAG with the phone number or bank account.
 In France, Sanef is also experimenting with payments via mobile on toll roads A13 and A14, which will be operational as early as April 2019.
 The Ronda Gi free "tag" device designed to streamline mobility without stopping between the Girona ring road tolls on the AP7 has been operating for one year now. This year, Autopistas distributed 180.000 devices free of charge to commuters on this section of the toll road.
With these improvements, the percentage of automatic or electronic toll transactions has increased in the Group to 78% (+2,1pp) of the total, of which 65,1% are only electronic toll (+2,8 pp). Argentina and India was salient for its remarkable growth.

MAIN FIGURES
At 2018 year-end, Abertis toll road activities have had a positive performance thanks to the solid increase in activity reported in the main countries where the Group operates. The activity achieved in Spain (continuing the pace of growth that began in 2016), traffic growth in France and a contribution from Chile and Italy are particularly salient. There was also a noteworthy recovery in Brazil, despite the lorry drivers' strike that affected heavy traffic in May, and in Puerto Rico upon conclusion of the reconstruction works following the damage left in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017.

REVENUE Revenue stood at 5,255 million, representing -0.3% versus 2017, primarily because of the negative performance of the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Argentine peso and US dollar; and, ultimately, the Vianorte concession (Brazil) in May. These impacts were mostly offset by the positive performance of the activity and revision of average rates in the toll road concessionaires, consolidation by global integration of Indian toll roads, and recognition of the pending rebalancing in Argentina.
Seventy-three percent (73%) of Abertis' revenues come from outside Spain. France has become the Group's largest market (34%), followed by Spain (28%).

EQUITY-ACCOUNTED COMPANIES The reduction in the incorporated income of equity accounted companies is mainly due to the non-recurring expense of 14 million in the profit and loss of Cellnex incorporated before its sale.
CORPORATE INCOME TAX The corporate income tax expense amounts to 296 million, with the following tax rates in the main countries where Abertis operates: Spain, 25%; France, 34.4% (versus the previous 39.4%); Italy, 27.9%, Brazil, 34%; and Chile, 27% (versus the previous 25,5%).
INCOME The 2018 consolidated income attributable to shareholders reached 1,681 million, representing a 87% increase compared with 2017.
The positive evolution of net profit is mainly due to the positive impact of a 605 million capital gain after the sale of 34% stake in Cellnex Telecom. Discounting this effects and other, the comparable profit grows +15%.
BALANCE SHEET Total assets as of 31 December 2017 amounted to 28,643 million, representing a 3.9% reduction compared to the 2017 year-end, mainly due to the impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real, Chilean peso and Argentine peso. Consolidated net equity in turn reached 5,926 million, (+24% vs 2017) due to the positive impact of the revenue in 2018.

DEBT STRUCTURE
The policies defined by the Board of Directors states that the debt structure of the Abertis Group seeks to limit the risks to which it is exposed due to the nature of the markets in which it operates. The Group's global risk management programme considers the uncertainty of financial markets and attempts to minimise the potential adverse effects on the global profitability of the group as a whole by establishing finance and hedging policies aligned with their business types.
In practice, it remains a sound financial structure with an elevated average debt maturity and, in keeping with a policy of minimising exposure to financial risks, an elevated percentage of debt is fixed or set through hedging, greatly minimising the possible effects of tension in the credit market.
Abertis' financial debt with credit institutions as of 31 December 2018 (excluding debts with equity accounted companies, interests from loans and obligations or other liabilities) rose to 16,012 million. The net financial debt (excluding debts with equity accounted companies, interests from loans and obligations or other liabilities) in the year decreased by 2,091 million to stand at 13,275 million. This debt decrease is primarily due to the impacts from the sale of 34% of Cellnex Telecom, adoption of IFRS 9 and the exchange rate. These effects were mainly offset by operating and organic expansion investments, acquisition of minority holdings in Italy, India and Hispasat, and payment of the second dividend for 2017.

The Abertis Group applies a set of measures aimed at minimising environmental impact that start from the design phase of the infrastructure itself, seeking a balance between sustainability and its economic and technical viability. This lets us define and implement preventive measures to preserve the environment and reduce pollution, giving shape to a more efficient, responsible and sustainable operations model.
The identification of environment aspects with significant impacts of the Group activity constitutes the base for their management, contemplating the entire life cycle of the activity. These aspects are identified during all stages of the life cycle and preventive measures are implemented to preserve the environment and reduce pollution in partnership with involved stakeholders with a view to minimising the impacts on the natural environment.
48.9% of the turnover has an environmental management system implemented and/or certified according to ISO 14001, and 33.7% is undergoing implementation because of the changes in France.

CLIMATE CHANGE
The GHG emissions derived from the use of the infrastructures and intensity related to liquid fuels, materials and energy used during maintenance and construction are some of the main sources of emissions related to the Group's activity.
Abertis has formally identified the risks and opportunities arising from climate change and is currently in the process of conducting an economic assessment on them as part of its corporate risk management framework and specific projects developed in this area.
Calculation and accountability of the carbon footprint is one of the organisation's main management elements in terms of climate change. Five years ago, Abertis began participating in the annual survey on climate change conducted by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which, in addition to standardising reporting, provides an aggregated analysis of the results of each participating organisation. The resulting report at the individual level provides detailed information regarding the risks and opportunities brought about by climate change for Group activities, generated greenhouse gas emissions and the corresponding mitigation actions. The CDP's aggregated analysis enables a global and comparable vision of all participating organisations.

The total CO2eq emissions for 2018 tallied 21 million tonnes, entailing a 0,01% reduction versus the previous year in terms relative to turnover. Of these figures, 93.9% corresponds to emissions generated by the use of infrastructures by their actual users (scope 3), and the total for scopes 1 and 2 on the total emissions is 0,5%.
Estimations related to air pollution based on the carbon footprint enable us to quantify this impact in a more reliable way in terms of direct fuel consumption.
Innovations in infrastructure management and the promotion of the use of greener vehicles are at the core of activities aiming to reduce scope 3 greenhouse gases. Some examples include the partnership between French toll roads and the WeNow startup to develop applications that improve vehicle energy efficiency and enable compensatory plantations for the generated greenhouse gases.
For the management of scopes 1 and 2 emissions, we have developed different actions for contributing to the established global reduction goal. Some of these actions are included in the improvement plans following energy audits.
 T he Spanish subsidiary Túnels implemented a mobility plan in addition to numerous road lighting improvements based on LED technology and promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources by using and improving the minihydroelectric power station on the route, which provides the subsidiary with an elevated percentage of its electricity needs.
 In addition to the solar panels operating in Brazil, LED-based lighting and solar powered micro-generators were installed at toll stations.
 T he Spanish Association of Automobile Fleet Managers (AEGFA) and the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE) granted Green Fleet Certification (Acreditación Flota Ecológica) to Autopistas concessionaires.
CIRCULAR ECONOMY
Adequate waste management is integrated into daily operations. Road maintenance is another way in which the environmental footprint can be reduced, often through R&D.
During 2018, work continued on developing joint projects for identifying the feasibility of reusing construction waste for pavement conservation.
 Toll roads in Spain have included a clause in waste management contracts requesting waste recovery as a priority treatment whenever possible.
 One of the Brazilian subsidiaries has been working on establishing partnership agreements with other organisations to recover and reuse some generated waste.
 After Hurricane Maria passed through Puerto Rico, partnerships were set up to reuse 67,500 tonnes of organic plant waste.

V a l u e c r e a t i o n | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis

While most wastewater generated during the activities is similar to domestic wastewater, appropriate measures are available to ensure an adequate management thereof in the case of other types of wastewater, including containment ponds and other treatment and purification techniques such as the use of decanters and hydrocarbon separators together with biological filters.
Worth highlighting is the wastewater treatment through the use of roots and the installation of rainwater collection tanks in Brazil to optimise water consumption and promote actions related to circular production processes.
BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL CAPITAL
BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION MEASURES:
· Emergency plans · Conservation and cleaning plans · Environmental tracking programmes · E nvironmental liability recovery programs · A wareness and education campaigns · Installation of wildlife crossings and enclosures · C ompensatory planting
 A documentary was made on the Serra do Cafezal Project in Brazil, particular in relation to the environmental protection measures in place during the construction of the new section The natural environment of this space entailed significant conservation challenges, in which regard the main goal was to minimise the project's impact on the surrounding natural environment.
 The toll roads in France have developed Sanef Aventures, a specific application for mobile handsets to promote and encourage a greater understanding of the biodiversity around the toll roads through gamification.
 In the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated many areas near the toll road with significant loss of plant life, Metropistas has begun reforestation along PR-22 under the banner of its "Metropistas recicla" (Metropistas recycles) programme. Reforestation efforts are also ongoing in Brazil, India, Chile and Argentina. A total of 46,217 examples of plant species have been planted in 2018.

WILDLIFE CROSSINGS IN BRAZIL
Arteris commenced work on a vegetation viaduct in 2018 for the passage of wildlife in Fluminense, an unprecedented project along Brazilian federal motorways. This viaduct structure was conceived to assist the passage of wildlife over toll rodas and prevent them from being struck or causing accidents, thus forming an ecological corridor joining forest areas on both sides of the road. With an investment of 9 million Brazilian reals, this viaduct is expected to have a vital role in conserving the region's biodiversity and has been built along the BR-101 in Río de Janeiro. Other Group concessionaires in several countries have already developed similar wildlife crossings to support ecological prosperity around toll roads.

 Environmental awareness is useful for extending the breadth of the organisation's environmental management actions. The campaigns carried out with the youth and infrastructure users in France, Spain, Brazil, Argentina and Puerto Rico seek to address conduct to safeguard the environment for the different stakeholders involved.
 A rteris rolled out its Golden Rules of Environmental Protection between January and October 2018 to mitigate the impacts of its construction work on the toll roads.
NOISE PREVENTION MEASURES:
· Installation of acoustic screens. · M easurement of the acoustic impact by means of control points.
The 2018 acoustic impact studies covered 3.958,1 km in Spain, France, Brazil, Chile and Italy primarily, i.e. 50% of the managed kilometres.
 The noise observatory in France continued working on identifying and addressing sensitive points with a view to group them together for future longterm management, prioritising points that affect large residential areas.
 Argentina is working on the use of noise-reducing asphalts and the deployment of reforestation plans.

Abertis has a policy and regulation regarding procurement that set out the essential principles that should govern our relationship with suppliers (qualifications, management, planning, efficiency and control) and specific guidelines for applying the policy in relations, contracts, quality and reputationrelated matters. The Code of Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility policy are expressly included in the procurement/purchasing policy and the risk management part of the regulations on procurement operations.
Abertis suppliers furnish services related to road maintenance and construction, cleaning and other complementary services that are part of transport infrastructure management operations. The suppliers of Abertis Mobility Services also provide specific connectivity products.
In 2018, the amount of main suppliers stood at over 4,500 collaborating companies, of which 1,071 are considered to be critical because of the purchase volume or type of products or services provided. Virtually all the suppliers are located in the same region where the organisation is operating and local purchasing is always done whenever possible.
The implemented supplier contracting process is electronic and includes a formal assessment and qualifications process based on the risk levels associated with the supplier organisation. Every country uses specific tools in this regard, shared in Spain, Brazil and Chile. A project is currently being carried out to harmonise supplier assessment and approval criteria across the countries by implementing a common supplier and procurement process management tool and its integration with the organisation's economic monitoring system.

V a l u e c r e a t i o n | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis

Supplier involvement in the development of products and services with positive ESG impacts is important, especially when they participate in activities related to road maintenance and construction. The objectives relating to external collaborators in the Master Plan are embodied in the four strategic pillars of the plan because of the cross-cutting impact they have on each aspect.
The scope of the nonfinancial information and main ESG-related management procedures include external collaborators and performance associated with steps taken within the framework of the organisation's activity life cycle is reflected in the presented data.
MAIN INITIATIVES IN 2018
 T he 4th edition of the Abertis Global Purchasing Meeting had participation of all people linked to the purchasing units in the different countries where the Group operates.
 A utopistas has carried out several actions in Spain, most notably the specific performance evaluation questionnaire, audits on critical suppliers and a global performance assessment report. Specific training was also given to key collaborators in occupational risk prevention and an suppliers' annual meeting is also held.

* This and the following graphs in this chapter are calculated from data with a nonfinancial information scope (specified in chapter 7 'About this report')

The Abertis Group strives to create a culture of respect, inclusion, collaboration, safety and health at the workplace. There is a growing number of women holding executive and management positions, thus consolidating a continuous positive trend. All countries have regulations linked to equal opportunities, though only Spain imposes the obligation to prepare a specific equality plan in relation to the various management aspects surrounding this matter, in addition to remuneration, such as promotion, training, selection, etc. The overall remuneration ratio for women vs men is 70.3%, a slightly lower percentage than the previous year.

 A utopistas rolled out 'Mi día en la autopista' (My day on the road), a specific section on the intranet that lets people from minority groups share the tasks that they carried out during the workday, thus encouraging more diversity in some of the involved positions.

 Túnels in Spain approved a harassment prevention plan.

 Puerto Rico conducted a salary and wage study according to the country's Equal Salary Law that revealed the main causes of the gender salary gap, namely seniority, level of training and responsibilities assigned to each job.

A total of 276 people took parental leave during the year, with a retention rate of 86.7% for men and 74.6% for women.

Starting this year, Brazil, France, Spain and Chile are required to hire a certain percentage of hiring of functionally-diverse workers, either directly or indirectly through the use of alternative measures. A total of 312 people from this group joined the workforce in 2018.

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
90% of executive-level vacancies in the last five years have been filled via internal promotion
TALENT PROMOTION
Talent promotion and retention are the main elements that make up Abertis' professional development policy. Committing to this talent base is thus a cornerstone of our people management policy. One of the Group's strategic objectives is to ensure that at least 75% of the executives and managers vacancies are filled by internal candidates.
In the last five years, 39 executive positions have been renewed in the Group, 32% of the total number of Abertis executives. Ninety percent of these new management positions have been filled by internal promotion via vertical or horizontal movements. In addition, over 48% of employees who have gone through the Talent program are currently holding a leading position in the Group.
The Group has established a Management by Objectives system for promoting talent. Currently, 100% of executives, 98.7% of managers (department heads) and 61.5% of the remaining positions are under this performance evaluation system.
Abertis has a Succession Plan in place for identifying the successors of all critical positions at the company and providing a global and cross-cutting vision to making the most of the organisation's talent base. The Succession Plan is already underway in most of the Group's business units. At present, the training needs of the identified successors with respect to the responsibilities of the positions to which they are appointed are under analysis.
KNOWLEDGE NETWORKS
Abertis has an extensive knowledge network, Connectis, a space that allows people involved in the different stages of the operation to share knowledge and work collaboratively with the goal of implementing continuous improvement processes across the entire group. Brazil, France, Spain, Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico are actively involved and, specifically, the areas of civil construction works, operations and exploitation, technology and information systems and procurement. The Connectis was extended in 2018 to the Legal, Customer and Marketing departments, and Italy. The Human Resources teams are set to be incorporated in 2019.
WORK ENVIRONMENT
The Group regularly conducts work climate surveys to measure employee satisfaction and develop action plans focused on improving staff well-being.

V a l u e c r e a t i o n | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Abertis

 In addition to the employee satisfaction survey (general satisfaction level of 80%), Arteris continued the 'Premio Valores Arteris' (Arteris Values Award) to recognise collaborators who incorporate organisational values and culture into their daily jobs. A total of 77 workers have received this award in which over 50% of the workforce have participated through nomination and peer voting.
 T he results of Chile's 'Yo Opino' (My Opinion) survey surpassed 80% insofar as satisfaction level at all the country's subsidiaries with the exception of two in which the figure stood at 75%. Likewise, the Argentine concessionaires also conducted a work climate survey, whose results will allow us to draw up and prioritise improvement actions.
 Puerto Rico created an internal relief fund of half a million dollars to support the families of workers who were affected by Hurricane Maria. While the fund was not fully used, the steps taken included the donation of power generators, furniture and home appliances, and payments on the repair of damage at the homes of collaborators.
 T he Túnels subsidiary in Spain conducted an employee satisfaction survey with satisfactory results. A specific action plan was made for aspects identified as improvable and will be implemented in the coming year.
 The activities of Mobility Services in France included an employee satisfaction survey, which obtained a score of 84%.
TRAINING
With the exception of three subsidiaries in Brazil, every country has annual plans that identify training needs and actions to be implemented during the year in keeping with the strategic priorities of the organisation.
 Arteris developed a specific application to promote and simplify access to the corporate intranet and all its contents. Workers now no longer need to use a computer to carry out their functions, since they can access the intranet directly from their mobile handsets, thus increasing intranet use. The application has been downloaded over 2,000 times, thus ensuring intranet access to a group of over 50% of the workers.
18.329 hours of training in corporate social responsibility was given in each country, particularly in France, Brazil and Chile.

CORPORATE VOLUNTEERING
In 2018, the Corporation and the Abertis Foundation celebrated Volunteer Day with numerous activities. Through the Voluntários Programme in Brazil, Arteris employees travel around toll roads to locate homeless youth living near the infrastructures. Among other volunteering actions, Sanef workers in France give music lessons to small orchestras consisting of children without economic resources. VíasChile's landscaping professionals in Chile teach classes to women in prison to encourage their re-integration into the workplace. Within the 'Construye tu Futuro (Build your Future)' plan, VíasChile succeeded in helping over 170 young people from highly socially vulnerable backgrounds in 2017 to obtain state scholarships to pursue higher education.

MAIN ACTIONS IN 2018
 T he Abertis Group launched Smart Risk as a global programme to consolidate and promote a health and safety culture for all employees.
 W ith a view to understanding all the Road Safety and Occupational Health and Safety projects of each business unit of the Abertis group in Latin America, the HR and Organisation Division held the First LatAm Risk Prevention in Road Safety Seminar.
 V íasChile implemented a month-long awareness-raising programme with actions aimed at addressing aspects related to occupational health and safety.
T he specific occupational health and safety training actions in 2018 tallied 146,271 hours for the entire group.
 Toll roads in India have implemented prevention actions, including the provision of suitable prevention equipment for the risks detected in each operation.
 F urther actions: specific tracking and control audits, psycho-social risk assessments, refreshing and updating of occupational health and safety management regulations and procedures, awareness-raising workshops and actions.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND APPRAISAL SYSTEM
The implementation of formal occupational health and safety management systems constitutes the organisation's main management tool in alignment with the Smart Risk Programme. Eighty-three point eight percent (82,6%) of turnover has an occupational health and safety management system implemented and/ or certified based on OHSAS 18001. Activities in India and Italy, one of the concessionaires in Puerto Rico and another in Argentina do not have a formalised system of this sort.
The health and safety committees constituting persons representing of workers' groups and the organisational management permit the systemisation and monitoring of the implemented actions. These committees met 525 times in 2018 to address specific occupational risk prevention-related matters such as trends in workplace accident data, causes of accidents that took place, auditing and workspace visits, psycho-social risk analysis, work plan tracking, the correct use of protective equipment, etc. 77.3% of the direct workforce is covered by a health and safety committee.
The involvement of indirect workers is also important, since they amounted to 13,207 in 2018 and were involved in 196 accidents that were not included in the data for the direct workforce presented herein. Preventive measures are extended to vendors and subcontractors through not only training and awareness-raising suppliers but also common reduction goals.
The data from India have still not been incorporated due to the particulars of this topic in the country. In addition, in 2018 two indirect workers died in Brazil due to a run over in one case and a contact with electricity in the other.

ABOUT THE REPORT

2018
NEW LEGISLATION
New Spanish law in force linked to the effective transposition of the European Non-financial Reporting Directive
SRS
(SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING STANDARDS)
International standard for sustainability reports promoted by GRI

PREPARATION METHODOLOGY
A new Spanish law entered into force in 2018 linked to the effective transposition of the European Union's Nonfinancial Reporting Directive and Spanish Royal Decree 18/2017 already in force, which slightly amended some aspects, including yet not limited to environmental, social and governance accountability requirements for organisations having over 500 employees.
In addition to requiring external verification of nonfinancial information published at the same time and in the same manner as the financial statements, the new law expressly incorporates different aspects necessary to include in financial reporting in terms of environmental, social and governance topics.
The Integrated Annual Report (IAR) for the 2018 financial year and the CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe comply with the requirements of the new legislation that also recognises GRI standards, the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as frameworks for drawing up internationally recognised nonfinancial performance reports.
These contents were drawn up following the requirements established by the following international standards:
· 2016 Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) of the Global Reporting Initiative for the comprehensive option.
· Communication on Progress (CoP) reporting policy of the UN Global Compact. · International Integrated Reporting Framework promoted by the International Integrated
Reporting Council (IIRC).
· S takeholder engagement accountability principles. · U N Sustainable Development Goals.
Together, the IAR and CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe contemplate the recommendations of external audit and evaluation entities insofar as environment, social and governance aspects, and are supplemented by additional publications of the Group and its companies.
The employed calculation methodologies include the formalised methodologies referenced, benchmark legislation for calculating carbon footprint, which includes ISO 14064: 1-2012, based on the international Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the criteria established in the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard published in 2011 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) together with the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB). The London Benchmarking Group's methodology has also been used to quantify the contributions linked to projects executed in relation to local communities.
The information in the IAR and its annexe was externally reviewed by an independent auditor commissioned to review financial and nonfinancial information according to the standards and procedures specified in the corresponding review reports annexed thereto.
The Board of Directors is responsible for formulation of financial and nonfinancial reporting in the IAR and CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe.

SCOPE OF THE INFORMATION
The scope of the financial information includes the total activity of the organisation, and the scope of nonfinancial information includes 97.8% of the total turnover and 95% of the workforce as of 31 December 2018.
The variations affecting the scope of the nonfinancial information versus the previous year correspond firstly to the exclusion of Vianorte, which was handed over to the public authorities upon expiration of the concession, and the inclusion of ViaPaulista because of the corresponding management contract award in 2018 (both in Brazil). Latina Manutençao and Latina Señalizaçao merged into a single organisation, entailing a restructuring to adapt to the main activities of the organisation (excluding mining activities that had been under the direct management of Latina before that date).
The re-expressed information and limitations on the scope of the data at a specific level were specified in the information published in the CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe.

STAKEHOLDERS AND MATERIALITY
STAKEHOLDERS
The main changes that took place in 2018 relate to the organisation's ownership and governance structure without any changes in Group activities. The materiality analysis update was affected by these changes, and is a task that should be carried out during the next year to respond to the need to include the Mobility Services activity and the countries that were incorporated in the management scope after drawing up the most recent materiality analysis in 2014.
The organisation's stakeholders and their characteristics remained unchanged, though it will be essential to assess the changes taking place in stakeholder parent

companies for activities that should be included in the materiality update process, namely Mobility Services, toll road management activities in Italy and India, and the changes that have taken place in the composition of the Brazilian and Spanish subsidiaries. It is worth noting that the investment community is the stakeholder that has substantially changed in relation to the previous year because of the Group's new ownership composition and delisting.

MATERIALITY
The performance and maturity of non-financial accountability of the industrial transportation sector have laid the framework for sector-specific studies for analysing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities based on specific nonfinancial reports published by organisations operating in that sector. The report recently published by the Governance & Accountability Institute on materiality and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pointed to the following priority material aspects for the industrial transportation sector:

O ccupational health and safety
· Q uality of employment · Infrastructure investments · E conomic performance · C limate change and air quality ·· T raining and professional
development Gender equality
·· Freedom of association and collective bargaining

E nergy efficiency
· T urnover · Corruption prevention · C ompliance · E qual pay · Social benefits ·· D iversity
Waste
· W ater quality ·· Compensation mechanisms
(Human Rights)

Parental leave
· P rocurement practices · O rganisational transparency · Indirect impacts · B iodiversity ·· Environmental investments

Likewise, the 'Sustainability Reporting Landscape in India', a study by the Reporting Exchange initiative, states that this country's priority ESG aspects include economic inequality, gender inequality (economic participation and related opportunities, education and health), waste management (generation and treatment), water (linked to the severe water crisis in the country), air quality (concentration of suspended particulate matter), use of renewable energy and other labour-related aspects. India's government is taking steps to palliate the negative effects of these issues by establishing an effective taxation programme, investing in solar power generation and improving education and opportunities for girls to tackle the gender gap.
The materiality analysis conducted by Italian toll roads in 2016 revealed the following highly relevant material aspects: road safety, traffic and emergency management, occupational health and safety, economic performance, government and risk management, corruption prevention, service quality and user/client satisfaction, impact on soil and landscape, professional development of employees, noise and supplier evaluation.
All these aspects, whether sector-specific or identified in Italy or India, are included as material aspects in the valid Abertis materiality, thus enabling us to assess their present relevance for the organisation's main sector of activity. Further, these and other material aspects are part of the organisation's nonfinancial reporting and constitute the foundation of the CSR Master Plan.
The infograph below presents the material aspects classified in relation to the life cycle stages of the infrastructure management activity for mobility and the organisational boundaries on which these aspects are located. It also expresses cross-cutting material aspects of different Group activities together with the priority SDGs for all the defined life cycle.

CSR MASTER PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
The Strategy Chapter in the Integrated Annual Report contains a global summary of the level of achievement of the objectives established in the CSR Master Plan (CSRMP). Halfway through its valid period, the quantitative objectives were changed to eliminate objectives that were specific to the telecommunications activity and adjust the established level depending on the progress of remote toll (teletoll) systems, since the initially established objective was achieved in 2017.
The main headway made in logistics to date relate to the strategic road safety and occupational security objectives, while the detected challenges primarily concern operational eco-efficiency and the environment, since our progress in these two strategic areas are below their expected levels.
CSRMP deployment has progressed slower than expected, mainly because of the organisational and governance changes throughout the Group since 2018. We nevertheless need to continue working to ensure the definition of specific actions focused on achieving the different goals set out in the Master Plan in every single country in line with the individual contribution to impacts.
MAIN ACTIONS CARRIED OUT
The CSRMP objectives and goals were included in the Construction Project Management Standard drawn up this year. This standard sets out the Abertis Construction Project Management Policy based on a model that adapts the PMI methodology to the needs and structure at Abertis based on a foundation of four basic pillars: proactive governance, structured processes, capable organisation and efficient control structure.
The overall aim is to enhance consistency in construction project management by prioritising decision-making based on risk analysis. The standard was drafted as a means to support Abertis project managers and execution teams and seeks to maintain the following qualities by adapting to the needs of each project:
· Timely decision-making by establishing clear escalation and decision circuits; and authority so the right people can make these decisions.
· C lear responsibility to attain project results and a risk management that matches the requirements of the Business Units or Project.
· Conscious alignment of regulatory, strategic, interface-related and projectspecific objectives and goals.
· D issemination of the information necessary to inform stakeholders of the project status quickly, effectively and transparently.
The standard will affect the different Engineering and Construction departments at the business units, thus yielding greater visibility of the progress of projects to other divisions such as CSR, Purchasing, Legal, Audit, Compliance or Finance. The implementation plan is set to be carried out in stages, the first of which entails the approval of the standard and model, and subsequent implementation for the projects at Valdastico North (A4Holding) and Quilicura (ViasChile).

CLGDR
Abertis
participates in the working group led by GRI on digital reporting.

ESG-related accountability became more frequent in 2018 with a view to gaining more continuous monitoring of the headway made in achieving the objectives established in the CSRMP while addressing the legal requirements in force for nonfinancial reporting. Abertis is also involved in the GRI's Corporate Leadership Group on Digital Reporting project, which will work on and analyse the existing potential in applying technology to nonfinancial accountability during the 2018-2020 period. Two work sessions were held to date, one in person and the other virtual, during which participants discussed matters related to the application of new information technologies and big data during the phases of nonfinancial reporting and for safeguarding that information. Further work meetings are expected to be held throughout 2019 and the results of the projects will be presented at the next GRI Global Conference in 2020.
Participation in external environmental, social and governance assessments remained active in 2018, though some of these assessments are expected to stop because the organisation no longer falls within the scope of the analysis for each initiative. The results of the FTSE Russell assessment for the FTSE4Good Index Series Family reveal substantial improvements in terms of good governance, which received the highest possible score, though there were slight setbacks in the social aspect. The score for the environmental dimension remained unchanged compared with last year's results. The RobecoSAM assessment for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) showcased the same improvements in the social dimensions and the challenges facing the organisation in terms of climate change and operational eco-efficiency. Finally, the participation in the assessment carried out by Corporate Knights for the Global 100 ranking and MSCI's ESG analysis is also worth mentioning.

ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE
Implementation of the code of ethics, one of the elements in the Group's crime prevention model described in the report, progressed even further in Italy, India and Túnels in Spain, subsidiaries that have deployed the code and formalised their whistleblowing channels. Workers also received training in code of ethics content and compliance in Spain and Italy.
We received a total of 366 complaints in 2018 related to breaches in the code of ethics, of which 359 were resolved. The increased whistleblowing in Brazil and France, linked to the deployment of specific awareness-raising projects and training on the use of the ethics channel in Brazil and adaptations to new statutory compliance requirements in France have caused a variation in the data compared with the previous year.

Eighty-eight point two percent (88.2%) of the cases opened in 2018 were resolved (including cases pending from the previous year) and 60.4% of these resolutions entailed dismissing the complaint. Likewise, 14.5% of the resolutions entailed the application of further disciplinary measures, 15.9% included warnings and 9.2% concluded with the dismissal of the implicated persons. A total of 48 complaints remained pending resolution at year-end.
The number of code-of-ethics infringements increased in comparison with the previous year, primarily due to the variation in the amount of complaints received and their subject matter, thus revealing not only the effective implementation of the code as a compliance assurance mechanism for corporate commitment to ethics and organisational culture but also the elevated reliability and effectiveness of the ethics channel and related investigation procedure. The main causes were noncompliance with internal policies, inappropriate conduct, conflicts of interest and legal infringements, among others..
REJECTION OF ALL FORMS OF CORRUPTION
In 2018, all Group business units worked on developing and updating rules, standards and procedures for preventing corruption, including standards related to institutional courtesies and gifts, conflicts of interests, sponsorships and patronage.

GRI SRS: 103-3, 205-2, 412-1, 412-2

A n n e x | 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Abertis

Training and awareness-raising actions also continued, as detailed further in the chapter corresponding to risk management and compliance.
The due diligence procedure developed as part of the Integrity Project in Brazil was particularly salient as it involved suppliers and focused on corruption risk prevention mechanisms. Additionally in this regard, the supplier database was updated for the purpose of maintaining active suppliers while rendering a more agile database as a tool of reference in procurement, purchasing and commissioning processes.
Specific training in procurement processes was given in Spain, in addition to the development of a specific supplier evaluation and related report with a view to learning from the assessment and audit processes on suppliers.
Finally, work was carried out at the corporate level to implement a supplier due diligence tool linked to the main supplier and procurement management system to extend compliance commitments made by the organisation to the supplier assessment and approval system. The due diligence process contemplates aspects such as different risk summaries, diversity aspects, legal records and organisational and governance particulars that will influence the overall compliance score and expand the analysed categories through agreements with third parties managing environmental, social or governance information. This tool will involve compliance teams in the supplier approval process while ensuring the integration of the crime prevention model into procurement teams, which will ultimately be linked to organisational procedures from the very outset to project execution phases within a framework of strategic supply chain management.
EXCELLENCE IN GOOD GOVERNANCE
The organisation's delisting and new shareholding composition have resulted in structural changes in its governance. The Extraordinary General Meeting held at the end of the year formalised the Board of Directors, which now comprises five members, though no specific committees have been created at December 31st.
The Abertis bylaws were reworded to adapt to the changes arising from the new governance structure and can be consulted at the organisation's website together with details on the changes. The Board of Directors handles environmental, social and governance matters, as expressly laid out in the General Regulations of the Board of Directors (available at the website).
Abertis complies with 69% of the different recommendations of the Code of Good Governance that are applicable to the organization, which reduced to 36.
Each chapter of the present report describes the claim mechanisms in place at the organisation and their performance throughout the year. Virtually all claims received were addressed and recorded for incorporation into the continuous improvement cycle.
A specific due diligence standard was also drawn up for assessing criminal risks applicable for growth and investment operations, which all stakeholders can view at the ethics channel webpage. This standard is the first step to be able to systematically include ESG aspects into investment projects and future acquisitions to assess all risks of crimes against human rights.

The variations in consumption associated with each scope directly affect the generated emissions, with the exception of electricity, where a reduction in consumption could coexist with an increase in emissions due to variations in the electricity mix. The reduction in direct energy consumptions is reflected in the trend for scope 1 emissions, which decreased by 13.8% in comparison with the previous year. Similarly, scope 2 emissions related to electricity consumption decreased by 5% in absolute values.
The materials and water consumption increased caused an upward variation in the associated emissions, adjusted by the reduction in emissions linked to the use of products and services, thus yielding a virtually constant value for scope 3 emissions versus the previous year.

Scope 1 emissions include the direct consumption of energy, whose sources are liquid fuels for vehicle fleets and power generator sets, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) and natural gas. Scope 2 emissions similarly depict indirect energy consumption linked to electricity, which is directly affected by the electricity mix in each country.
Finally, own renewable sources mainly refer to the electricity generated by toll roads in Spain and Brazil. It should be noted that energy from these sources grew by 35.8% versus the previous year because of the greater hydroelectric power generation capacity in Spain linked to increased rainfall, and the installation and operation of micro solar plants in Brazil. While these sources still represent a small percentage (1,821 MWh, i.e. 0.4% of the total energy consumed), it is nevertheless essential to continue taking steps to favour an increased use of this energy source, since its GHG emissions are significantly lower.

Actions carried out in Spain and Brazil, primarily entailing the installation of LED lighting technology and the incorporation of generators with better efficiency levels, directly affected the electricity consumption in these countries, which reported significant reductions in associated consumptions. Chile in turn finished substantial construction works that managed to stabilise electricity consumption while Puerto Rico has yet to return to pre-Hurricane Maria consumption levels.
The global electricity consumption has therefore decreased in absolute values and turnover-related terms and remained below the 2015 consumption figures.

(*) The 2017 and 2016 figure for Brazil varied slightly because of a modification in Brazilian consumption after drawing up the report.

The reduction in construction work, vehicle fleet decrease and data scope modifications (particularly Latina's restructuring in Brazil) contributed to reducing the consumption of liquid fuels in the year, which decreased by 24.4% in turnoverrelated terms. The variation for Puerto Rico is due to the recovery of the context following Hurricane Maria in 2017.
The organisation's total vehicle count decreased by 4.7% versus the previous year, primarily in passenger cars and vans in Brazil and France. The fleet comprises 3,064 vehicles, of which 32.9% are passenger cars, 23.6% vans, 19.5% lorries and the remaining are other types of vehicles.
Natural gas consumption increased, primarily because of weather incidents in Italy and France.

The water consumption increase in Brazil due to a leak and the variation in weather conditions that directly affected the consumption of this resource in Chile (necessary to ensure the conversation of the environment around the infrastructures) led a 17.6% increase compared to the previous year in turnoverrelated terms.
The distribution for water consumption by sources remained constant compared to the previous year, and wells and rainwater represented 19.6% of the total water consumption.
Work must continue on systematising energy management in the different countries, extending existing practices in regions in which legislation requires energy audits or implementing specific energy management systems.
In addition to the progress made in boosting greener vehicles presented in the chapter on safe and innovative roads, it is also essential to share the methodologies used to calculate GHG emissions from vehicles driving on the infrastructures and the associated air pollution with a view to identifying where improvement can be made and establishing relations with the different groups involved in the reduction and mitigation of this environmental impact.
INNOVATION BASED ON CIRCULAR ECONOMY CRITERIA
Infrastructure maintenance activities require the consumption of construction materials, mostly non-renewable. The consumption of recycled materials compared to the previous year increased by 4.3% in absolute values, though the percentage on the total consumption decreased slightly in relative terms to 12.5% of materials consumed during the year. Granules and asphaltic agglomerates represent the main consumed recycled materials, and it is thus essential to promote these categories to achieve the consumption target set in the CSR Master Plan.

(*)The 2017 figures for granules, asphaltic agglomerates, metals and paints varied slightly because of a modification after drawing up the report.

Two hundred and forty-four (244) tonnes of paper and 17,793 tonnes of other significant materials were also consumed. The type of maintenance work and intensity of construction work directly affected the consumption of materials, which is why these figures fluctuate significantly in the different years. In overall terms, material consumption increased by 8.9% in relation to the previous year, primarily due to the variation in the consumption of granules and asphaltic agglomerates.
Construction and demolition waste represent 79.8% of the waste generated by the organisation's activity. A total of 42,096.4 tonnes of this type of waste were recovered in Spain, and work should continue to extend proprietary projects and in collaboration with other stakeholders to increase the amount of construction and demolition waste reincorporated into the consumption flow. The total amount of generated waste remained constant in comparison with the previous year, though there were different variations based on the actual work carried out in each country.

DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The actions developed to increase products and services with positive environmental impacts specified in the chapter on safe and innovative roads and creating value were conceived to foster partnerships with strategic stakeholders to secure the objectives and targets established in the CSR Master Plan. Particularly prominent in this regard are subcontractors and suppliers participating in construction and maintenance projects, public sector entities and organisations that promote innovation in the use of materials, etc.
The systems for assessing and approving suppliers, and the training, awarenessraising and formalisation processes for shared operating procedures are in place to contribute to achieving the targets and objectives.
The target figure for the percentage of remote toll (teletoll) transactions and revenue was increased in the CSR Master Plan to 80%, since this figure was attained in 2017. The trend continued in 2018 and a total of 65.1% of the transactions and 57.2% of the revenue were carried out through this payment method, which contributes to reducing emissions generated in the operation.

POSITIVE SYNERGIES WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES
The actions described in the section on contribution to the community in the chapter on 'Value creation' contain the most relevant events in connection with the consolidation of positive synergies with local communities carried out by our different subsidiaries and the Abertis Foundation.
The amount allocated to social action projects and sponsorships in the year remained constant at 6.3 million (7.4 million including management costs). The number of projects (total of 303) has decreased slightly in relation to the previous year, mostly because of the change in their recording criteria, which grouped together several projects in some cases. It is worth noting that in 2018 we used a new project tracking and management tool linked to the London Benchmarking Group methodology, whose benefits included the ability to link social projects and sponsorships to Social Development Goals as specified further in the report.
Ad-hoc contributions decreased significantly in comparison with the previous year while business-aligned initiatives increased. There was also an increase in geographic diversity linked to executed projects because of engagements made as part of the agreement with UNICEF.

All complaints from local communities were addressed and mostly came through our user service channels and the code of ethics whistleblowing channel.
FOSTER AND MAINTAIN NATURAL CAPITAL
The actions carried out for the conservation of biodiversity and natural environment at toll roads during the year were described in the corresponding section in the chapter on value creation.
The number of kilometres affecting a protected zone varied slightly in comparison to the previous year, mainly due to the modified scope for data in Brazil. The total in this regard was 1,357 km, for a total surface of 6,698 hectares. These spaces have a wealth of biodiversity and include species that the IUCN has listed as protected.

The figure for animals struck by vehicles (16,131) remained virtually unchanged from the previous year, with the highest numbers in Brazil, Spain and India. Compensatory plantations of 78,526 plant species were also made, mainly in Chile and India in response to the variation of the intensity in construction work, which decreased in 2018.
Air quality was monitored by the regulatory agencies in the different countries, who were permanently in contact with the organisation to ensure compliance with the limits established in the pertinent legislation in force. Following the exercise commenced back in 2017, an estimation was made on the polluting emissions from the organisation's direct activity, excluding emissions linked to vehicles on the toll roads.

The total amount of kilometres managed in the scope of the CSR Master Plan has remained unchanged since the previous year, though the overall activity has increased as shown in the figures for ADT, which either kept constant or increased in all countries.
The context of growing activity is particularly relevant when analysing the annual figures on road accidents, which were positive in all countries with the exception of Chile and France, where the number of accidents increased slightly. Likewise, the number of fatalities decreased by 12.5% versus the previous year, though the distribution was much less balanced by country. There was a significant increase in traffic fatalities in Spain, Puerto Rico and Argentina, offset by reductions in all the other countries.

BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT QUALITY
Professional development is a key material aspect linked to the retention of talent, as defined in the related section in the chapter on creating value, which contains an explanation of the actions carried out during the year.

The total number of new hires increased by 9.7% in relation to the previous year, attaining a total of 2,833, of which 60% correspond to men. Similar to previous years, Brazil, France, Chile and Argentina make up the bulk of new hires. The full-time workforce decreased slightly because of the variation affecting women. This distribution is virtually the same in all countries with the exception of Spain and Italy, where women in the full-time workforce is less (41.8% and 62.8% respectively).

Ninety-three point 4 percent (93.4%) of the workforce has an indefinite contract, a percentage that has remained similar for the groups (women and men) and countries, except in Argentina, where the figure stands at 89%. Temporary contracts formalised during the year decreased significantly in relation to the previous year because of variations in Spain and Brazil, attaining an aggregate level of 736 contracts, of which men correspond to 60.3%.

The stabilised staff turnover in Chile and Argentina has affected the global figure, which returned to 2016 levels. This reduction was replicated in every country except for Brazil and Italy, where the figure actually increased. Contract expirations are excluded from the staff turnover figure because they mainly contemplate temporary employment contracts linked to the need for permanent coverage of track support. The main causes of turnover include organisational restructuring and personal and professional improvements.

ENSURING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Group's code of ethics expresses the commitments to equal opportunities, non-discrimination and diversity, for which actions were carried out as described in the human team section.
The number of women in the workforce continued increasing at the global level and in terms of professional category. In this regard, women make up 37.9% of the workforce (2.9% more than the previous year), 18.6% of executives (11.8% more than 2017), 26% of managers (6.7% more than the previous year) and 39% of the rest of the workforce (2.9% higher than last year).

A n n e x | 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Abertis

The remuneration ratio for women compared with men at the Group stood at 70.3% at an aggregate level. Thus, by professional category, the ratio stood at 84.6% for executives, 96.2% for managers and 73.9% for all other workers. The elevated number of executives at the central headquarters affects the global ratio, which stands at 42.8% (60.5% for executives, 85% for managers and 89.3% for all other workers).
With the exception of Italy, all countries have a minimum wage set by the pertinent legislation in force. The relation between the base entry salary and the local minimum wage remained constant for all countries save Puerto Rico, where the local minimum wage increased from last year.

A total of 276 employees used parental leave during the year, 18.1% less than the previous year, primarily because of the variations in Brazil and Argentina, especially with men.
The total personnel on the workforce with functional diversity decreased slightly because of the reduced presence of this group in France and Brazil. There was a notable increase of personnel in Chile linked to the associated quota set by new legislation. France and Spain comply with the legislation in force with a functionally-diverse workforce of 2.5% and 7.7% respectively, including direct employment and alternative measures (purchases of goods and services, and donations to Special Employment Centres and Integration Agencies, together with the hiring of specific groups). Finally, most Brazilian subsidiaries achieved their quotas, though the ones that failed to increase hiring justified their inability to meet the quota.
QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS
The chapter on safe and innovative roads specifies the headway made in developing products and services with positive social impacts. Work should continue to develop specific tracking indicators for these actions.

METHODOLOGY AND INTERNATIONAL EQUIVALENCES
PREPARATION METHODOLOGY
STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES
The Annexe to the CSR Master Plan expands upon the level of detail in the information regarding the Group's nonfinancial performance in 2018 included in the 2018 Integrated Annual Report (IAR). The preparation of the IAR and Annexe is a shared endeavour and fulfils the requirements and recommendations included in the following benchmark international standards:
· 2 016 Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for the comprehensive option.
· C ommunication on Progress (COP) reporting policy of the UN Global Compact. · International Integrated Reporting Framework promoted by the International
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
· S takeholder engagement accountability principles. · U N Sustainable Development Goals.
The methodology used is compliant with the requirements of Spain's new nonfinancial reporting law that entered into force in 2018 as a transposition of the EU Nonfinancial Reporting Directive. Nonfinancial reporting is thus published in a concentrated way in the IAR and the CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe at the same time and manner as the Group's Annual Financial Statements. GRI 101 (Foundation) presents the reporting principles for defining report content and quality. Our management and accountability procedures related to the content of the IAR and CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe are focused on securing compliance with GRI principles and primarily include:
· M echanisms for managing and tracking environmental, social and governance impacts in place at the companies making up the Group linked to the deployment of valid policies.
· D irect involvement of the persons responsible for managing and tracking the environmental, social and governance dimensions at preparing the content.
· R egular tracking and monitoring of nonfinancial information during the year. · U se of nonfinancial information management and collection technological
systems.

The reference indicated in the GRI Content Index corresponds firstly to the paging of the Integrated Annual Report and then to other publications indicated with the corresponding initials:
· 2 018 Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and Management Report · 2018 Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) · 2 018 Carbon Disclosure Project Questionnaire (CDP, corresponding to 2017,
published in 2018).
The reference indicated in the GRI Content Index corresponds mostly to the paging of the Annexe, according to page references to the IAR and other publications indicated with the corresponding initials.
SCOPE OF THE INFORMATION
The non-financial information contemplates 97.8% of the 2018 turnover of the Group and 95% of the head count (at December 31st). The main variations that occurred correspond to the following factors:
· E xclusion of Vianorte (Brazil) because of its handover to public authorities upon conclusion of the concession.

GRI SRS: 101, 102-56

144 | 145

· Inclusion of ViaPaulista (Brazil) because of the management contract award in 2018.
· Merger of Latina Manutençao and Latina Señalizaçao into a single organisation that entailed restructuring to adapt to the main activities of the organisation (excluding mining activities that had been under the direct management of Latina before that date). The IAR "About" chapter lists companies in the Group that are included in and excluded from the scope of the nonfinancial information.
CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES
The calculations performed and presented in the IAR and the annexe meet the following standards:
· Calculation references in the standards listed above (mainly GRI). · ISO 14064-1:2012, based on "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard" and the criteria established in the "Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard" published in 2011 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and the CDSB methodology for calculating the carbon footprint.
· London Benchmarking Group for quantifying the contribution to the community.
In light of the shortened IAR drafting period in 2017 linked to the date of the general meeting, 2017 data were re-expressed after the reporting was initially closed. All re-expressions were explained in specific notes located where the reexpressed data were published.
EXTERNAL REVIEW
Nonfinancial information in the IAR and CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe was externally reviewed by an independent auditor according to international nonfinancial information audit standards (primarily ISAE 3000). The external review report included in the CSR Master Plan Tracking Annexe and notes arising from the external review process included in the GRI content index specify the results of this external review.
