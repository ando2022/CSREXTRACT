// Review by the President and CEO
Heading into 110th year of operations with an order book of EUR 110 million

Our growth in 2017 was broader than in previous years. Alongside major new-capacity projects, we experienced strong growth in replacement and improvement investments, as well as modernizations. In 2017, we set new records in net sales and in operating profit. We will celebrate our 110th anniversary by keeping up the good work.

4 RAUTE 2017

Our strong development continued for the third
year in a row. Entering into 2017 with a strong order book, we achieved 31 percent growth and set a new record in our net sales. In terms of the amount of orders received, we fell just short of last year's record high, but we can still be pleased with the EUR 155 million we achieved. Even without our major new-capacity projects, the fourth quarter of 2017 was one of the best in the company's history. The strength of our order intake is illustrated by the fact that, despite our record-high net sales, our order book grew and also reached an unprecedented level, at EUR 110 million.
The positive general economic trend that carried throughout 2017 accelerated towards year-end, despite the sustained uncertainty caused by political tensions. The drive to implement investments also grew. For Raute, this was reflected as growth in demand in North America and Russia, and, in Europe, as a stronger relative share for southern Europe. The strengthening of South America's and Asia's economies towards the end of the year has not yet translated into new orders for us.
Major new-capacity projects again played an important role in our order intake, in both the fourth quarter and the full year. A clearly larger proportion of our orders stemmed from mid-sized replacement and improvement investments and modernizations than before. This shows that our customers' situation and confidence in the future are good. In addition to mill projects, we proved our competitiveness both to our new customers and also in smaller-scale projects.

We continued with our strong focus on improving the competitiveness of our products and operations. We complemented our offering in April with the acquisition of Metriguard Inc.'s veneer and lumber grading technology business. It was Raute's first business acquisition in more than ten years. Alongside these new developments, we increased our investments in product development, our production capacity, quality and our employees' competence. The number of our personnel also increased, this time mainly in Finland.
Our operating profit grew 35 percent and our total of EUR 11.6 million is Raute's all-time best. We can be pleased with this result, and our hard work shows. It will bear fruit in the coming years. We can thank our main unit in Nastola, in particular, for our growth in net sales and thus our improved result. Our measures to boost the production capacity were highly successful. Our focus on quality and on developing our operations could be seen not only in our successful delivery capabilities, but also in our ability to carry out start-ups according to plan. The success of our machine vision and measuring technology continued.
Raute turns 110 this year. We will celebrate this major milestone by keeping up the good work. We kicked off the year with a record-high order book, and 2018 already looks promising in terms of new orders. This means we can be confident that our positive development will continue and we will retain the high net sales and operating profit that we have achieved. We will, of course, still target improvements through our development projects

and investments. We have scheduled our recordhigh order book in a way that will enable us to continue to provide competitive delivery schedules to our customers in smaller-scale projects and services. In 2018, we are especially focusing on emerging markets, where we have set our sights on finding a back-up for industrialized markets when demand there begins to level off. In terms of larger new projects, we are already turning our gaze towards 2019.
I would like to express my sincerest thanks for the past year to everyone who made our success possible: to Raute's customers for their invaluable cooperation and trust, to our personnel for their outstanding work and strong commitment to executing major workloads, to our shareholders for their continued confidence in us, and to all our other partners for the part they played in furthering Raute's development and success.

Veneer

Plywood
LVL
Wood products
Veneer is a thin wood ribbon manufactured by peeling or slicing from a log. Plywood is a panel of wood consisting of thin, cross-bonded veneers. LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) is a wood product made of veneers glued with their grains parallel and then hot pressed; it is used in load-bearing structures.

1

Re-use Items containing plywood and LVL can be repaired and re-used for the same purpose, or they can be repurposed.

2

Recycling Plywood and LVL pieces can be recycled and used for a new purpose either in their current state or after being further-processed.

3

Energy use Plywood and LVL that have reached the end of their useful life can be crushed and combusted in power plants.

End uses
The veneer, plywood and LVL produced by our customers are used mainly in construction and furniture-making and in the transport vehicle and packaging industries. By investing in our advanced production technology, wood products industry operators can boost their production, significantly reduce their consumption of wood, energy and chemicals and improve the quality of their end products.

Circular economy
After their useful life, all wood products can be recycled or used as a raw material in energy production. While the majority of wood waste in Finland ends up in energy production, in southern Europe, for example, recycled wood is an important raw material for the chipboard industry. The circular economy is transforming business models, and in the future, wood products will be increasingly recycled.

New challenges ahead for China's plywood industry
China is the world's largest producer of plywood. The production capacity
of veneer and plywood has grown roughly 10 per percent year in the country in the past decade. Production has traditionally been performed mostly by hand and has been based on simple technology.
The trend that started at the end of 2017 reinforces the change in the plywood industry for the long term. In our view, the industry is targeting a higher degree of automation to save in labor costs, more advanced technology to improve the quality of end products and an improved production process to meet environmental standards.
We have been in China for a long time now, developing modern plywood solutions for the country's emerging markets and global plywood production. Our presence and input offer an excellent springboard for when the anticipated development, which has already been seen in other business sectors, takes off.

Development in Asia-Pacific steered by raw material availability
The general economic situation in the countries of Asia-Pacific headed in a
positive direction in 2017, driven by growing economies. The favorable trend is expected to continue in the area in the coming years. The positive vibe in the wood products industry has not, however, reflected steady development. Particularly in Southeast Asia, raw material availability has become an increasingly key challenge.
We steered our operations in an increasingly service-driven direction in 2017 to support our long-term goals in the area. Drawing on our full technology and production process know-how, we improved the competitiveness of our offering to meet the needs of local industry. We expect our updated Raute Lite concept to create new business opportunities and to show in our order book as early as in 2018 and 2019.

Plywood production continues to grow steadily in North America
North America is a major market for plywood and LVL. However, very few
production investments have been made in this product area in recent years due to over-capacity in the market. Investments have targeted modernization projects and boosting existing production.
In the second half of 2017, we received a major order related to the implementation of a large-scale new investment in LVL capacity in the market.
Local machinery manufacturers and production automation experts have a solid foothold in domestic markets, and competition for what little investments there have been has been challenging. We have nevertheless succeeded in growing our local service business in the areas of maintenance and spare parts, as well as in production line upgrades, automation and modernizations.
We believe our operations in North America will develop favorably and will focus mainly on the service business.

Responsible technology and services for the manufacture of wood products

Our technology offering responds to the require-
ments and needs of our customers' entire production process. Our project deliveries include full-scope mill processes and the production machinery, separate production lines and individual equipment they encompass.

Our customers include veneer, plywood and LVL mills, the majority of which are relatively small private family companies. Some of our customers are part of major consolidated forest groups that manufacture not only plywood and LVL, but also products such as pulp, paper and sawn timber.

Our services cover the entire life cycle of the machines and equipment used in the production process. Our technology services include basic services, from spare parts deliveries to regular maintenance and modernizations. We also modernize our competitors' machines with our latest technology. Our expert services support our customers in both investment decisions and production development. We have supplemented our service offering with advanced digital services that allow us to provide our customers with parts of services efficiently and quickly over the internet ­ saving costs, time and the need for travel.

The growing popularity of wood construction has also led to increased investments in the manufacturing technology used for veneer-based products, especially in the developed markets of Europe and North America. Demand in these areas has focused on state-of-the-art technology, which is one of our major strengths.
Clearly lower emissions
From an environmental viewpoint, the attractiveness of wood products with a long lifetime is based on the renewability of the raw material and the continued storage of the captured carbon dioxide

R A U T E 2 0 17 17

18 R A U T E 2 0 17

Raute's wood technology as part of a low-carbon society
Over the past 25 years, Raute has delivered mill-scale veneer, plywood and LVL projects corresponding to an annual capacity of more than five million cubic meters. The products manufactured by these mills store an annual net volume of close to three million tons (0.59 t/m3*) of carbon dioxide, which is captured by the growing trees.
After the emissions generated by the production chain, the carbon dioxide stored in the products that are made in the mills manufactured by Raute corresponds to the emissions of up to 800,000 cars every year.
Sustainable forestry and long-lasting wood products are key enablers of a low-carbon society. Raute's full range of technology supports this development.
* Calculated using the Cradle-to-Gate life-cycle estimates of the environmental declarations for commercial plywood and LVL products in Finland and its neighboring regions. The fossil emissions generated in production are deducted from the carbon dioxide volume corresponding to the organic carbon stored in the product. The amount of carbon in one cubic meter of plywood or LVL corresponds to approximately 750-1,050 kg of carbon dioxide, depending on the tree species.

in the end products. The useful life of plywood and LVL can be as much as a hundred years. When abiding by the principles of sustainable forestry, a corresponding number of new trees grows in place of the harvested trees. The volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreases, and the carbon sink of a specific area of forest grows.
Depending on the species of tree and the quality of the wood, one cubic meter of plywood or LVL contains carbon equal to approximately 750 to 1,050 kilograms of carbon dioxide captured by trees. In a modern production chain, this volume exceeds many times over the volume of fossil carbon dioxide emissions arising during production. Rather than causing emissions, the use of plywood and LVL thus binds carbon from the atmosphere and, in turn, helps mitigate climate change. Binding solutions based on wood lignin will make the products entirely independent of fossil raw materials.
Major profitability and environmental benefits
One of the key goals of our product development has been to reduce customers' raw material waste and need for additives. We actively develop solutions to enhance the energy efficiency of customers' production processes and improve the utilization of by-products generated during the production process. The financial useful life of the installed machine base can be extended through technology services that cover its entire life cycle and through modernizations based on the latest technology. Services based on IoT technologies, for their part, are speeding up the adoption of our services and may substantially decrease the need for travel.
Many of our customers stress the importance of occupational safety. This is something we pay special attention to already in the product development phase and in the planning phase for

customer-specific line solutions. Occupational safety and ergonomics can also be improved through automation.
SmartMill for the benefit of our customers
Our SmartMill concept received a new pillar of support with the acquisition of the leading grading technology company Metriguard Inc. in April 2017. The integration of grading characteristics with Mecano's machine vision and moisture-measuring technology raises grading and optimization technology to an unprecedented level. The purpose of the SmartMill concept is to maximize the value yield in the panel manufacturing process by measuring the properties and quality of the raw material at several stages of the process, and to make process control decisions based on a combination of data. Thanks to technologically advanced sorting solutions, the highest-quality parts of the raw material can be used in products that will benefit most from their properties. Stateof-the-art machine vision and grading technologies can help customers to substantially improve the quality of their products as well as the profitability of their business.
More efficient drying technology
For veneer sheets made of wood with a high moisture content, nearly all the water must be removed from the sheets before they can be made into panel and beam products. This takes place in the veneer drying machine, the part of the production process that consumes the highest amount of energy in the entire production plant. We remodeled the drying process using the latest and most advanced engineering and simulation methods.
The outcome is a new veneer drying machine that was designed in 2017 and whose performance has been verified through tests carried out on a prototype built at our product development center. In addition to a more efficient process, we have also

revamped the structures to meet current manufacturing methods and safety requirements, for example, in earthquake risk zones. Through these measures we have improved both the payback of our customers' investments and our own competitiveness.
Longer life for old mills
In addition to new production lines, we offer our customers a growing number of new modernization products that can extend the life cycle and efficiency of their production lines. Some modernization products are born by modifying and applying parts of existing products, and some products are developed especially for modernizations.
Some examples of modernization products that were completed in 2017 are harmonized new control systems and graphical user interfaces for lines; modern software platforms for old XY chargers to support the latest laser measuring equipment; a modernization product for old dryers for process control; and support equipment developed for two old types of lathes to improve yields.
Productivity for product portfolio management
In order to reinforce our position as a global technology leader, we have also developed our engineering and product management methods. We have bolstered our growth targets by investing in our IT systems, which enable us to speed up the lead times in our own production and foster collaboration in our various partner networks. In our product engineering, we have focused on developing the PDM/PLM system, the product portfolio management system and the feedback management systems, and their integration. In addition, a dynamic simulation environment has been introduced in our product development. We used it to present the Digital Twin simulator of our SmartPeel veneer lathe at the Ligna Trade Fair in Hannover, Germany, in 2017.

// Strategy
Cost-effective complete solutions according to customer needs

Raute's core competence encompasses the manufacturing processes of selected wood products. With digitalization, Raute's technology services can be scaled to meet every need from basic maintenance services all the way to full control of line productivity.

Our company's strategy boils down to our vision:
Raute offers profitable solutions and services for all customer needs. Profitability is essential for the continuity and development of both our operations and those of our customers. Our complete solutions are a combination of advanced technology and services related to using that technology and developing and optimizing the customer's entire production process.
Profitability, adaptation and growth are the strategic goals
Our strategic goals are to improve our profitability and maintain it at a good level, to have the ability to adjust to variations in economic cycles, and controlled growth. Our financial goal is to grow faster than the markets, remain financially sound and offer our investors competitive returns.
As the actualization of our goals is strongly tied to the development of the global economy as well as the timing of our customers' individual investments, we do not disclose time-bound target values for our financial goals.

We are genuinely interested in our customers' needs. If we are to offer them profitable solutions, we must understand the bottlenecks in their processes and the criteria for implementing investments. By truly understanding our customers we can become the preferred supplier to a growing number of customers in more market areas. This means having a product offering that meets our customers' needs and helps them to succeed and develop their operations.
At their best, collaboration and understanding lead to a long-term partnership based on trust, where challenges are overcome and opportunities are seized together. Partnership with us includes the promise that we serve our customers for the entire life cycle of the investment, and that we will apply our technology also to modernizations of machinery delivered by our competitors. The life cycle of basic equipment can be extended by upgrading the equipment base.
As the markets evolve and technology moves forward, the proportion and importance of services grow; and digitalization increases the opportunities to develop the service offering.

Strategy implementation in 2017

In 2017, our strategic development projects focused
on developing our product and service offering and our competitiveness. Our goal was to increase our market share and improve our profitability. Our strategic focus in 2018 is on competence and personnel development.
The cornerstones of our strategy are customer needs, growing technology services, operating on the emerging markets, cost-effective and highquality operations and employees that are hungry for success. We review our strategic choices annually. Our company's management sets the focus, goals and main themes for the strategic development work. Through HR management, we ensure that all our employees understand our strategy and implement it in their work.

Customer needs
We launched the development of the Raute Lite concept and product family. Raute Lite is primarily aimed at growth- and development-driven customers in emerging markets and, in more mature markets, at smaller companies entering the industry as newcomers.
We continued to grow our contract-based maintenance service, and we successfully increased the number of lines covered by our maintenance contracts by a substantial number. We continued to increase resources in our local maintenance centers.
Our acquisition of Metriguard Inc.'s business in April 2017 supplements our offering in terms of high technology and expands Raute's technology offering to sorting solutions for the sawmilling industry.

Personnel and a hunger for success
We continued with the mentoring program that we launched in 2016. We also implemented the first phase of our Raute Leadership and Service Excellence programs. Both programs will continue in 2018 for new personnel groups.
At the end of 2017, we introduced the RauteACADEMY online learning environment for our own personnel training and for training services aimed at our customers. From now on, new Raute employees will be introduced to the company's values and Code of Conduct with the help of a digital learning environment.
The focus of personnel development expanded from reinforcing a quality-oriented mindset to developing occupational safety. We also succeeded in reinforcing our resources particularly in automation engineering.

Cost-efficiency and quality
Our largest production investment in 2017 involved our Vancouver plant. The new machining equipment boosts our capacity and our operations in our North American technology services business. The machinery investment in question was the largest in our North American production for more than ten years.
We further expanded the use of Lean methods in the production operations in Nastola, as well as in other functions at the Nastola unit. In product management, we continued the implementation of a process for boosting the reuse rates of tried and tested solutions in planning.

Emerging markets
We continued our efforts to enter the Chinese market. We launched new measures and renewed our organization pertaining to our Chinese operations. We have not yet, however, reached our goals there. We will revise our strategy in that area in 2018.
Our project aimed at tapping into the African markets has progressed according to plan, albeit a bit slower than anticipated in terms of customers and financing. The Raute Lite concept offers the perfect technological solution to that challenge.

Technology services
We continued with the launch of our SmartMill concept based on the latest G5 machine vision and moisture analysis technology, which we introduced to the market in the fall of 2016. We delivered our 100th measuring device employing G5 technology in October 2017.
We launched a technology service operation based on digital remote services with a selected customer group.

We help our customers succeed Lifetime partnership with customers
We continuously improve work safety Health and safety
We highlight the eco-friendliness of wood products Sustainable product and service solutions

// Responsibility
Values and strategy in line with responsible management

We hunger for success Competence development
We respect our principles Sustainable supply chain and business ethics
We continuously reduce our environmental impacts Environmentally efficient production
We are in this together Stakeholder engagement and local communities
For Raute and Raute's close stakeholders, these responsibility topics are among the most important aspects related to sustainable development. The economic, social and environmental impacts of Raute's operations were analyzed to define the aspects, and the aim was to identify issues where Raute can best promote the principles of sustainable development.

Responsibility is one of the fundamental values
that guide our operations. We aim to systematically develop the environmental soundness of our products and services and to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. We abide by the principles of good corporate citizenship by taking into consideration nature and its protection, and how society as a whole operates, and by respecting local cultures and valuing diversity. Our Code of Conduct tells our personnel about Raute's requirements and expectations concerning responsible and ethical operations.
In 2017, we examined the materiality analysis of the company's most important responsibility topics from the perspectives of personnel, investors and customers. Company management set targets for the most important responsibility topics, and the monitoring of these targets will be integrated into management's reporting in 2018.

Raute supports and respects the principles of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We recognize the fundamental rights at work as defined by the International Labor Organization ILO, including the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, the abolition of forced labor, and equal opportunities and treatment of employees. Our company has zero tolerance for corruption, bribery and money laundering. Raute does not engage in business involving corruption, bribery or money laundering. We prevent risks related to the above through training and by actively monitoring compliance with our company's Code of Conduct. We also aim to minimize the risk of fraud our company is exposed to by means of continuous monitoring and by developing our systems and practices.
In 2017, we defined a common Supplier Code of Conduct, which will be included in all new supplier and subcontractor agreements. We minimize risks related to our supply chains through efficient monitoring and by actively auditing our suppliers.

// Good workplace
Skilled employees are our strength

Ambitious, skilled and target-oriented employees
are our company's most important resource. That is why we place the highest priority on the continuous development of our employees' professional skills. This helps us to ensure the successful execution of our strategy ­ now and for years to come.
In 2017, the number of our personnel increased 9%. We expanded our business into a new technology, and along with the acquisition of Metriguard, our employee numbers in the USA grew by 24. Turnover of people leaving the company decreased to 16.9% from 18% previous year.

In 2017, we adopted a new online learning system that allows all our employees to broaden their knowledge and develop their competence on their own terms. In the first phase, all internal training related to our Code of Conduct takes place through the system.
In 2017, we worked closely with different educational institutions and science communities in the form of internships, theses, projects and corporate visits. The educational institutions were mainly technology and commercial schools, as well as universities and polytechnics. We employed a total of 49 interns, who worked in delivery control, assembly, engineering and product development, among other areas.
We also continued our mentoring program in 2017. The aim of the program is to transfer valuable tacit

knowledge and skills from senior employees to younger employees. Last year a total of 22 mentoring pairs participated in the program. Teams of junior and senior employees have also been found to be an excellent way to come up with completely new ways of doing things.
We implemented other types of training based on identified training needs. The customer service program "Service Excellence," and "Site", related to working at building sites, were among the significant training programs we held in 2017. Dozens of Raute employees working in the customer interface took part in these programs. We also

organized a five-day global management training program aimed at, among other things, developing managers as coaches, as givers of feedback and as challengers. The program served as a pilot for the training program starting up in 2018.
According to the employee satisfaction survey carried out in 2017 among the company's personnel in Finland, 88 percent of personnel are very satisfied or quite satisfied with their workplace. Additionally, 96 percent of personnel would recommend or have already recommended Raute as a workplace to friends or others.

// Occupational safety
Aiming for a clear reduction in accidents

We aim for an increasingly better, more productive
and safer work environment. Our long-term goal is to one day have an entirely accident-free work environment. At the Group level, our short-term goal is to achieve fewer than 10 accidents leading to absence from work for every million hours worked.
Typical accidents in our line of business are, for example, a tool or item that is being machined slipping, breaking or falling and causing injuries to a person's limbs. Tripping or falling is also a common cause of an accident. We require the use of appropriate safety gear for the task at hand, and all new employees are familiarized with occupational safety matters.

Keeping working spaces clean and organized can influence and prevent accidents. What is most important is for all employees to have the right attitude to occupational safety: all accidents can be prevented if sufficient care is taken.
In 2017, we improved occupational safety monitoring at our own plants, as well as in work we commissioned from outside parties. For the first time, key occupational safety indicators were calculated at group level for our North American and Chinese plants, using similar principles as those

used to monitor accidents in Finland. In Finland, we continued to routinely rectify factors causing safety risks using our safety observation system.
In 2017, the number of accidents leading to absence decreased within the Raute Group, but increased in the company's Finnish operations, despite measures to improve occupational safety. The Group's LTIF figure was 23.3 (2016: 28.1) and for the Finnish

operations it was 19.1 (2016: 15.5). We are not satisfied with the current level of the safety indicators, and we aim at a clear reduction in the number of accidents already in the short term.
* Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF): Accidents leading to absences lasting at least 1 day for every million working hours. The indicator reported for Finnish operations has been adjusted after some previously unrecorded accidents were identified in the review of accident reporting process.

Environmentally efficient operations

Raute's Nastola operations are certified according to
the ISO 9001 (Quality) and ISO 14001 (Environment) management standards. The company follows the principles of continuous improvement, which aims for the continuous reduction of environmental impacts, and the identification and elimination of risks. Raute's environmental management program sets goals for example for improving energy efficiency, reducing waste and managing chemical safety.
Environmental reporting for production units outside of Finland was developed further in 2017. This section contains the energy and water consumption data for all Raute production units. Data on waste volumes is presented only for Finnish operations.
Energy consumption and emissions
The Group's energy consumption* in 2017 amounted to 9,055 MWh (2016: 8,832 MWh). Raute is part of the Confederation of Finnish Industries' energy efficiency agreement also for the 2017­2025 period. In 2017, Nastola's assembly hall completed the conversion to LED lighting, and the heating method for the last oil-heated building on the property was changed to district heating. The first charging points for electric cars were installed in the employee parking lot. The energy efficiency of operations, calculated as energy consumption per hours worked, improved 5.6% from 2016, as the number of working hours grew proportionately more than energy consumption.
Carbon dioxide emissions** from Raute's own operations totaled 2,006 tons (2016: 1,953 tons). The VOC

emissions of Nastola's painting facility amounted to 5.9 tons (2016: 4.7 tons). Growth in emissions was caused by increased production volumes.
Waste
Waste in Raute's Finnish operations amounted to 350.4 tons (2016: 423.5 tons), not including recyclable metals. Of that amount, hazardous waste accounted for 46.8 tons (2016: 52.2 tons). The volume of waste relative to the parent company's net sales was 2.7 tons/EUR million. The reduction in waste volumes is primarily due to the higher-than-normal waste volumes resulting from the cleaning and renovations that took place on the Nastola premises

in 2016. Roughly two thirds of the waste generated by Raute in Finland is recycled, and nearly a third is used as fuel for energy. Some 2% of all waste is disposed of in landfills.
Water consumption
Raute's production operations do not involve processes that consume high volumes of water. The Group's water consumption amounted to 8,214 m3, or approx. 32 liters/employee/day.

Thanks to a good opening order book and active market situation, we set a new record in our net sales, with 31% growth.
Our full-year order intake was at a very good level. Project deliveries were down 19% from the previous record year, due to a 50% decrease in the amount of new-capacity projects. Projects with separate production lines and machines more than doubled.
Order intake in technology services increased 33%. Modernizations were up 51%, and other technology services grew by 6%.
The order book is very strong, at MEUR 110. It includes six new-capacity-generating projects in which Raute is the full-scope supplier. Some of the order book is already scheduled for 2019.
