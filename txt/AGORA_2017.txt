Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Shareholders,
Another year of positive changes in the Agora Group, including dynamic development of many of our projects, as well an restructuring of some of our businesses, is behind us. The year 2017 was yet another stage in the execution of the Group's development plan announced in March 2014. We are glad that the initiatives which we have been consistently implementing over the last four years are bringing tangible results - better than expected.
The Press segment has been successfully changing the business model and restructuring its operations. This led to a significant improvement of its operating result. At the end of 2017, the number of active digital paid subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza exceeded a record level of 133,000. This is an excellent result and a good sign, confirming the correct direction of changes and development of our press activity.
The Film and Book segment closed the year with a double-digit revenues and operating result increase. Undoubtedly, this was the result of our consistent policy in the cinema market - for this reason we are going to continue to expand the Helios chain. The success of the segment is also due to the improved results of the film business and Agora's Publishing House, with huge popularity of such productions as Sztuka kochania. Historia Michaliny Wislockiej or Po prostu przyja and books such as Sztuka kochania, Tu bylem. Tony Halik and Ania ­ a biography of Anna Przybylska. In the outdoor advertising market the priority of the Agora Group remains reinforcing its leading position in the premium media segment. We have been implementing this plan with considerable success, which is reflected in the financial results of our Outdoor Advertising segment. AMS has been achieving business targets significantly higher than planned ­ it ended last year with a double-digit improvement of its operating result, recording the best result in its history. When it comes to the online business of the Group, our priority is a significant development in the fastest-growing market segments. We plan investments in selected content categories, new formats and mobile applications. We dynamically develop the programmatic area, which is one of the sections of the online advertising market offering the best prospects. Yieldbird, a company operating in this segment, was listed in a prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing technology companies in Europe. When it comes to our radio business, the overriding objective is to increase profitability. In 2017, the operating result of the Radio segment saw a double-digit increase. At the same time, we continue pursuing an effective development strategy of our stations by increasing considerably the scale of our activity. Radio Pogoda enjoys huge popularity among listeners, and TOK FM Radio reaches record audiences. The changing situation in the media market prompted us to verify the approach of the Agora Group to our presence in the television market. In 2017, we decided to divest of shares in the most popular television channel created on the eight multiplex of terrestrial digital television. We still remain a partner of Kino Polska and continue to co-create the Stopklatka TV channel. One of the targets announced by the Group in 2014 was keeping the Print segment in the black. In 2017 we failed to achieve this due to the rapid changes in the portfolio of our customers. In response to this situation we made a difficult decision to restructure this area of our business, including group redundancies. The aim of the Management Board is to permanently restore the profitability of this segment. Summarising, we see the positive effects of the implementation of our development plans. We are successfully adjusting our offer to the requirements of the fast-changing media market and systematically seek new sources of revenues. In 2018, we will present a new development strategy of the Agora Group. I am convinced that everything that we have done todate is an excellent starting point for taking a bolder look at the possibilities of increasing the business volume and the further development of the Group. In the new, enlarged Management Board, we are working on a plan that will meet the challenges of the future. Attaining our business and financial goals, we want to be the first and obvious choice for users and partners to whom our media and undertakings provide reliable information, quality journalism, interesting entertainment or innovative solutions guaranteeing that they can effectively reach their customers. I would like to thank everybody ­ our shareholders, customers and employees ­ for their support and trust placed in Agora, and our everyday audiences: readers, users, listeners and viewers ­ for their interest and loyalty.
Bartosz Hojka President of the Management Board of Agora S.A.

AGORA GROUP MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(MD&A) FOR YEAR OF 2017 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REVENUE PLN 1 165.5 MILLION EBITDA PLN 118.9 MILLION EBITDA MARGIN PLN 10.2%
NET LOSS PLN (79.3) MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 77.3 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2017, while comparisons refer to 2016. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP [1]
In the fourth quarter of 2017 the revenue of the Agora Group (the "Group") amounted to PLN 330.4 million, and was lower by 2.9% yoy. The segments which noted growth of revenues were: the Movies and Books as well as the Internet. The revenue of the Movies and Books segment grew by 10.0% and amounted to PLN 122.7 million. The largest growth - by 8.8% - was observed in the revenue from sales of cinema tickets, which represented PLN 66.6 million. The concession sales were also higher - amounting to PLN 24.7 million, and so were the advertising revenues in the cinemas - amounting to PLN 11.7 million. The segment also recorded higher revenues from the movie business - PLN 4.6 million, and from Agora's Publishing House activities - PLN 12.2 million. In the fourtyh quarter of 2017, the revenue of the Internet segment increased and amounted to PLN 52.6 million. It was primarily affected by higher proceeds from the internet advertisements, i.a. on account of dynamic development of Yieldbird. The Outdoor Advertising segment revenue was similar to that in 4Q 2016, while the revenues in the other operating segments of the Group were lower. The sharpest decline - down to PLN 18.7 million - was recorded in the Print segment. The factors which were decisive for the level of revenues in that segment included drop in the production volume due to, inter alia, discontinuation of cooperation with some customers, and higher share of print on customer-provided paper. The revenues of the Press segment decreased to PLN 61.9 million, which was related to the continuation of negative market trends and decision to discontinue publication of selected press titles. At the same time, Gazeta Wyborcza successfully develops its digital subscription offer. At the end of December 2017, the number of digital subscriptions of the daily amounted to almost 133 thousand i.e. 23 thousand more than at the end of September 2017 (i.e. up by almost 21.0%). The Radio segment revenue amounted to PLN 36.1 million. It was affected mainly by lower revenues from the air time sales in the radio stations of the Agora Radio Group as well as lower video production proceeds.
In 2017, the revenues of the Group lowered to PLN 1,165.5 million. Higher by 14.3% yoy revenues of the Movies and Books segment in the amount of PLN 416.2 million had a positive impact on the level of the Group's revenue. This resulted mainly from the growth of revenues from cinema tickets sales - up by 14.0% yoy, to PLN 222.4 million, and significantly higher revenues from the Group's film business, amounting to PLN 28.1 million. The concession sales were also higher yoy - amounting to PLN 83.1 million, and so were the advertising revenues in the cinemas - amounting to PLN 35.1 million. A revenue increase - to PLN 168.6 million - was also observed in the Internet segment, mainly due to higher proceeds from Internet advertisements and revenues from the sales of ads in verticals. The Radio segment saw increased revenues to the amount of PLN 114.0 million. It was caused by higher revenues from brokerage services provided for Helios cinemas as well as higher revenues from the air time sales in the radio stations of the Agora Radio Group. The strongest impact

on the Group's revenue level in 2017 had lower yoy revenues of the Print and the Press segments, which amounted to PLN 101.7 million and PLN 235.5 million, respectively. At the same time, another success with regard to the digital transformation in the Press segment is worth mentioning. There were almost 133 thousand digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza. Another segment to record lower revenues was the Outdoor Advertising (a drop by 3.0% yoy, to PLN 163.0 million), mainly due ceasing advertising cooperation with the Warsaw metro and Agora's Publishing House.
The Company conducted asset impairment tests based on long-term financial forecasts for each business segment of the Group. The analysis showed the necessity to incur impairment loss of fixed assets. The largest impairments of assets took place in the following segments: the Print (PLN 51.6 million), the Press (PLN 13.2 million, mainly the value of the monthly Cztery Katy), and the Internet (PLN 21.8 million, mainly the goodwill of Trader.com. (Polska) Sp. z o.o.). The total impact of impairments on the consolidated operating result of the Group in the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to PLN 88.9 million. According to the regulatory filing (1/2018) published by the Company on January 4, 2018, Agora also reviewed the useful lives of selected fixed assets of the Group, which resulted in higher amortization charges in the Movies and Books segment, and in Agora's general costs in the amount of PLN 4.8 million. The aforementioned impairment losses are one-off and noncash, and do not affect the liquidity of the Company and of the Group or its investment plans.
The value of the aforementioned impairment losses rendered serious influence on the higher operating costs of the Group ­ both in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the whole 2017. It's worth to notice that had the cost of the impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 not been taken into account, the level of the Group's operating costs in the last quarter of 2017 would have been at a level similar to the one observed in the corresponding period of 2016, and it would have been significantly lower yoy in 2017.
Due to the cost of asset impairments incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Group's operating costs rose up to PLN 404.6 million. The impairment loss weighed down on the results of the Print, the Internet, and the Press segments. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Print segment operating costs increased to the amount of PLN 74.5 million, PLN 51.6 million being the value of impairments. The other cost items in this segment significantly decreased due to a lower yoy production volume resulting from discontinuation of collaboration with certain customers and a higher share of print on customer- provided paper. In the Internet segment, the operating costs amounted to PLN 64.7 million, PLN 21.8 million being the value of impairments. In addition, this segment saw higher yoy promotion and marketing costs as well as external services costs, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the Press segment, the operating costs amounted to PLN 70.1 million, and ­ in spite of the impairment loss amounting to PLN 13.2 million ­ were lower yoy than in the fourth quarter of 2016. This reduction resulted mainly from lower yoy promotion and marketing costs as well as from the restructuring process carried out in 2016. The 14.3% yoy rise of the operating costs in the Movies and Books segment, up to PLN 114.5 million, was mainly caused by the development of the Helios cinema network, a higher yoy cinema attendance, higher yoy staff costs, and a one-off adaptation of the depreciation rate to the shortened period of useful life of selected cinema projectors. In the Outdoor Advertising segment, the operating costs shrank by 6.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 39.1 million, mainly due to the lower yoy costs of the system maintenance. In the Radio segment, the operating costs dropped by 7.8% yoy to PLN 27.1 million, mainly due to the lower yoy costs of promotion and marketing, and external services costs.
In 2017, the Group's operating costs amounted to PLN 1,238.5 million, and were higher by PLN 56.8 million than in 2016, mainly due to the cost of impairments totalling PLN 88.9 million, which weighed down on the Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Had it not been for the impairment losses, the total amount of the Group's operating costs would have been significantly lower yoy than in 2016. The impairments weighed down mainly on the results of the following business segments: Print, Internet, and Press. Excluding the impact of the asset impairment costs in the Press segment, its operating costs would have been significantly lower yoy. In the period under analysis, the costs of raw materials, energy, consumables and printing services were 22.0% yoy lower, totalling PLN 57.8 million. It results from the lower printing volumes of Gazeta Wyborcza, changes implemented in the product structure, and the discontinuation of selected press titles. Another important factor impacting the reduced costs in the Press segment in 2017 were lower yoy costs of promotion and marketing ­ down by 33.7% yoy, to PLN 29.9 million. In the period under discussion, the other cost items in that segment were also lower yoy. Also in the Print segment, the 2017 operating costs were significantly lower yoy ­ had it not been for the impact of the asset impairment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2017, the costs of raw materials, energy and production services in the Print segment decreased by 40.2% yoy, to PLN 64.0 million. That drop was caused by the lower yoy production volume in the Group's
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 7

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements

printing houses, resulting from the discontinuation of collaboration with certain customers, a lower yoy volume of orders, and a higher share of print on customer-provided paper. As for the Internet segment, the higher promotion and marketing costs as well as external service costs rendered significant influence on the higher yoy operating cost level, apart from the impairment loss. Lower yoy operating costs were recorded in the Outdoor segment ­ a drop by 5.9% yoy, down to PLN 134.7 million. This was caused mainly by lower yoy system maintenance and lower yoy staff costs. In 2017, the Radio segment's operating costs declined by 3.3% yoy, and amounted to PLN 97.3 million. The main reason behind that were the lower yoy external services costs as well as lower yoy promotion and marketing costs. The Movies and Books recorded a significant increase in operating costs - up by 14.7% yoy, to PLN 386.5 million. The main reason behind that was the development of the Helios cinema network and a higher yoy cinema attendance. The segment recorded the highest rise ­ by 20.8% yoy, to PLN 191.9 million ­ in the external services item. The reasons behind it included: higher yoy rental costs in the Helios cinema network, resulting from a bigger number of cinemas, higher yoy costs of film copy purchase, and higher yoy fees for film producers. The staff costs increased by 31.6% yoy, to PLN 51.6 million. It was caused by the increased minimum hourly wage since January 2017, and a higher headcount due to the Helios cinema network development. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Group's EBITDA lowered yoy to PLN 43.1 million, while throughout 2017, it was 2.5% yoy higher, totalling PLN 118.9 million. Beginning from the fourth quarter of 2017, the EBITDA indicator, which was previously defined by the Company as EBIT increased by depreciation and amortization, does not include the costs of impairment of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets. Due to impairment of assets which encumbered Agora Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2017 with PLN 88.9 million, the Group recorded a loss at the EBIT level of PLN 74.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and of PLN 73.0 million in 2017. The Group's net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to PLN 72.3 million, and PLN 79.3 million in 2017. The net loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent company amounted to PLN 73.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to PLN 83.5 million in 2017. The Group's net result, both in 2016 and 2017, was impacted by a series of one-off events. In 2016, the significant events with a positive impact on the Group's results included: gains from the disposal of shares in a subsidiary company (Green Content Sp. z o.o.), and the outcome of the control takeover transaction settlement in the company GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. The disposal of the Group's real estate in Lodz also rendered some positive influence on the overall result. The collective redundancies provision in Agora S.A. had negative impact on the Group's results. In 2017, the most important factor with a negative impact on the Group's results were the asset impairments totalling PLN 88.9 million. On the other hand, the profits from the disposal of the remaining shares in Green Content Sp. z o.o. had a positive effect.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Agora Group's advertising revenue increased by 0.8% yoy, and amounted to PLN 167.6 million, as compared to the corresponding period of 2016. It was lower yoy in the Press and the Radio segments. It is noteworthy that, in the case of the Press segment, the sales dynamics of advertising services, apart from being affected by market trends, was also impacted by the discontinuation of selected press titles, including notably the free daily Metrocafe.pl. On the other hand, an increase in sales of advertising services was recorded in the Internet segment as well as in the Movies and Books segment. The revenues from the sale of advertisements in the Outdoor Advertising segment was at the same level as in the corresponding period of 2016.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue from tickets sold in Helios cinemas increased by 10.3% yoy and amounted to PLN 66.6 million. In the period under analysis, the number of tickets sold in the Helios cinemas amounted to almost 3.6 million, i.e. 8.0% more than in the fourth quarter of 2016.

thousand to almost 133 thousand. Also Agora's Publishing House recorded increased revenues from the sale of its publications. Cinema concession sales increased by 10.8% yoy to PLN 24.7 million. This was caused by higher yoy cinema attendance and a yoy increase in average prices at cinema bars. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the revenues from sales of printing services of Agora Group were lower than in the same period of 2016, and amounted to PLN 16.7 million. This resulted primarily from the discontinuation of collaboration with certain customers, lower volume of orders, and a higher share of print on customer-provided paper. Other sales amounted to PLN 20.3 million and were similar to those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Last year, the value was positively affected by the revenues from the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt game and its extentions, as well as the exhibition entitled Titanic. The Exhibition. In 2017, the Group's total revenues amounted to PLN 1,165.5 million, and were 2.7% lower than in 2016. In 2017, Agora Group's advertising revenue decreased by 2.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 547.3 million. They were lower yoy in the Press and the Outdoor segments. The sharpest decrease in advertising revenue was recorded in the Press segment, partially due to the condition of the press advertising market and the discontinuation of selected press titles, including the free daily Metrocafe.pl. In the Radio segment, the total advertising services revenues were higher than in 2016, but at the same time the radio advertising services revenues were lower yoy. The growth of advertising sales was visible in the Movies and Books segment as well as in the Internet segment. In 2017, revenue from tickets sold in Helios cinemas increased by 14.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 222.2 million. In the period under analysis, the number of tickets sold in the Helios cinemas amounted to almost 12.2 million, i.e. 13.0% more than in 2016. In the same period, the overall number of cinema tickets sold in Poland amounted to almost 56.6 million and, increased by 8.8% yoy [10]. In 2017, the Group's copy sales revenues amounted to PLN 134.3 million, and were by 1.0% lower than in 2016. The factors that influenced the level of the Group's copy sales were, among others, the continued downward trend with regard to copy sales of printed press, offset to some extent by the increase in sales of publications by the Agora's Publishing House, content subscriptions on Wyborcza.pl and special editions of Gazeta Wyborcza magazines. There were almost 133 thousand digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza. In 2017, the Group's printing services revenues amounted to PLN 94.0 million, and were 36.4% lower than those reported in 2016. This was mainly due to discontinuation of collaboration with certain customers, a lower volume of orders, and a higher share of print on customer-provided paper. Cinema concession sales increased by 14.9% yoy to PLN 83.1 million in 2017. This was caused by higher yoy cinema attendance, and an increase in average prices at cinema bars. Other sales amounted to PLN 84.6 million and were lower by 2.6% than those reported in 2016. It resulted mainly from the additional revenues reported in 2016 from the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt game and the exhibition entitled Titanic. The Exhibition.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Group's net operating costs increased by 28.2% yoy and amounted to PLN 404.6 million.

Costs of external services, which increased by 2.7% yoy and amounted to PLN 122.4 million, were the largest cost item. This is the consequence of, inter alia, higher yoy costs of film copy purchase at Helios cinemas, which was reflected in the increased revenue from ticket sales, higher yoy costs of consulting and auditing services and higher fees for film producers. However, costs of production and rent of space for advertising panels were lower yoy. In the fourth quarter of 2017, staff costs increased by 0.9% yoy, to PLN 87.2 million. The highest increase in staff cost took place in the Movies and Books segment, which was associated with the change of the minimum hourly wage introduced at the beginning of 2017 and higher yoy headcount in the Helios network as a result of new cinemas opening. At the same time, these costs were reduced in the Internet, Press, Print and the Radio segments. In the Outdoor segment, they remained at the same level as in the fourth quarter of 2016. At the end of December 2017, the Group's headcount was 2,847 FTEs, i.e. it decreased by 131 FTEs as compared to the end of December 2016. The number includes FTEs cut down in the process of collective redundancies the cost of which weighed down on the Group's result in the fourth quarter of 2016. This reduction results, first of all, from a lower yoy level of employment in the Press and the Print segments, and in the supportive divisions. A decrease in the cost of raw materials, energy and consumables, recorded in comparison with the fourth quarter of 2016, results mainly from a lower volume of printing orders in the Print segment, a lower printing volume of main press titles published by Agora Group, and discontinuation of publication of selected titles. The Group's costs of promotion and marketing decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 by 11.4% yoy, to PLN 22.5 million. This was driven by the decrease of this cost item in the Press, the Movies and Books and the Radio segments. In the Outdoor Advertising segment, they remained at the same level as in the fourth quarter of 2016. They increased only in the Internet segment.
In 2017, the Group's operating costs totalled PLN 1,238.5 million, i.e. they were 4.8% higher than in 2016. The main reason behind it were the asset impairment costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Had it not been for the impairments, the Group's operating costs would have been lower than in 2016.
In 2017, the costs of external services increased by 1.6% yoy to PLN 430.8 million. The increase in this cost item was mainly driven by the Movies and Books and the Internet segments. In the Movies and Books segment, the increase was due to higher costs of film copy purchase, in relation to the larger number of tickets sold, fees for film producers in connection with the Group's film business as well as a larger number of cinemas in the Helios network, which resulted in the higher costs of space rental at shopping centres. The increase in the costs of external services in the Internet segment was mainly related to the brokerage of advertising space of third-party Internet publishers and was offset by revenues generated in the same area as well as higher yoy costs of marketing services. In 2017, staff costs increased by 1.4% yoy to PLN 327.6 million. This was mainly due to higher staff costs in the Movies and Books segment, related to a rise in the minimum hourly wage introduced at the beginning of 2017, and in the number of Helios network cinemas. A slight yoy growth of staff costs was reported in the Internet segment. In the Group's other operating segments staff costs decreased compared to 2016.
A significant decrease in the cost of raw materials, energy and consumables (down by 22.7% yoy to PLN 170.9 million) resulted mainly from the lower production volume in the Print segment and a lower yoy volume of main press titles published by the Agora Group. Promotion and marketing costs were also lower yoy in the period under consideration, amounting to PLN 74.7 million. This resulted mainly from less intensified promotional activity in the Press, Radio as well as the Movies and Books segments. Such costs grew yoy, on the other hand, in the Internet and the Outdoor Advertising segments.

3. PROSPECTS
On 26 February 2018, the Company informed about concluding the promised sales agreement with regard to the perpetual usufruct right of non-developed landed property of the total area of 6,270 square metres, located in Warsaw at 85/87 Czerniakowska street.
The total sales price of the Property will amount to PLN 19.0 million net, while positive impact of this transaction on the operating result (EBIT) of the Company and the Agora Group in 2018 may amount to approximately PLN 8.3 million.
On 27 February 2018, the Company reported execution of a promised sales agreement in regard to the sale of the perpetual usufruct right of two lands covering the total area of approx. 347 square meters, located in Gdansk, at 19/20 Welniarska street and 7/8 Tkacka street, along with the ownership right of the adjacent administrative and residential building with a net surface of approx. 1,508 square meters.
The total sales price of the Real Property will amount to PLN 8.65 million net, while positive impact of this transaction on the operating result (EBIT) of the Agora Group in the first quarter of 2018 will amount to approximately PLN 5.6 million.
The decision to sell the Property stemmed from the fact that the Company did not utilize effectively the entire Property for its operations.
On 7 February 2018, the Management Board of Agora S.A. reached agreement with the trade union and the employee council regarding collective redundancies in the Print segment. The Group will dismiss up to 53 Print segment employees (i.e. 16.3% of all the segment workforce, including 1.9% employed in Agora S.A., and 17.1% employed in Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. , as of 1 February 2018) between 15 February and 16 March 2018. The estimated cost of the collective redundancies reserve will be approximately PLN 1.6 million, weighing down on the Group's result in the first quarter of 2018. The estimated savings from the restructuring process will amount to, throughout the year, approximately PLN 2.0-2.5 million. The final amounts will be provided in the finacial report for the first quarter of 2018.
The reason for the planned restructuring measures, including restrictions on employment, is the ongoing decrease of revenue from sales of print services in the coldset technology in which Agora Group's printing plants specialise. This trend mainly results from the condition of the press market in Poland ­ the main client of the Company's coldset printing plants. In 2017, decisions on the resignation from the printing of promotional materials in the coldset technology in favor of another technology, made by some customers outside the press sector, had a significant impact on the lower revenues from this business. Services commissioned by clients from other market segments, including those realised in the heatset technology, present a significantly smaller share in the Group's print activity; due to infrastructural constraints, they never did, nor are able to, compensate for the decrease in revenue from coldset printing services.
Therefore, the Management Board of the company decided that it is necessary to take decisive restructuring measures aimed at reducing operating costs of printing plants and optimizing the operational processes so as to reduce the negative impact of decrease in print volumes on the financial condition of the Print segment, i.a. by adjusting the employment structure to the current volume of services provided by Agora's printing plants.
On 20 December, 2017, Helios S.A., a subsidiary company of Agora, signed a term sheet with two natural persons in order to establish a company involved in developing and operating a network of eateries, inter alia, in the "fast casual" segment.
The condition for concluding the investment agreement is to establish rules for cooperation and conduct of the newly established company, and to obtain the consent of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection.On February 15, 2018 the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection granted a consent to concentration by creating a joint venture by Helios S.A. with its registered seat in Lód (a subsidiary company of Agora S.A.) and two natural persons. The rules for the concentration had been included in the application form.
On March 6, 2018 Helios S.A. signed an investment agreement with two individual investors: Piotr Grajewski and Piotr Komór. The subject of the Investment Agreement is to establish a new company and co-operation between parties under the agreement. The aim of the Company is to design the concept, create, manage and develop
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 15

(mainly via establishing own brands) a network of 45 eateries located in Poland: in shopping centers or as independent premises.
Helios S.A. shall take up 90% of shares (which corresponds to 90% of votes at the meeting of shareholders) and shall invest in it PLN 5.0 million. Helios estimates that the total amount of investment shall not exceed PLN 10.0 million. The individual investors shall jointly take up 10% in the Company (5% each). The Investment Agreement allows them to increase their involvement up to 30% in total, provided that the Company meets defined financial targets.
The Individual Investors are experts in the gastronomy industry. They will perform functions in the management board of the Company and they will be responsible for conducting its operational activities. Helios will co-operate with the Company and will support its development.

3.1. Revenue
3.1.1 Advertising market [3]
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the advertising market in Poland increased by 5.0% yoy. Advertisers spent ca. PLN 2.65 billion to promote their products and services. In 2017, the total amount of expenditure on advertising increased by 2.0% yoy and amounted to ca PLN 8.8 billion.

According to Company's estimates based on the analysis of market data the advertising market expenditure in 2018 shall grow by 2-4% yoy. The data on estimated changes in the dynamics of particular media segments are presented in the table below:

3.1.2 Copy sales
In 2018, the prevailing negative trend of copy sales drop with regard to printed dailies and journals will be maintained, however, the drop rate should not be higher than in the preceding years. The Company regularly reviews its press title portfolio. In October 2017, it decided to discontinue the publishing of two titles: Dom&Wntrze and Magnolia. At the beginning of 2018, it sold publication rights of Swiat motocykli to a company established by one of the editorial employees. The consequences of these decisions will be seen in the level of revenues generated by Agora's Magazines division. At the same time, the Company is working on the sales of its digital content. At the end of December 2017, the number of paid digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza was close to 133 thousand.
3.1.3. Ticket sales
The most significant factors affecting attendance in Polish cinemas are the repertoire, the affinity of the Polish society and distance to the cinema. Based on the available information, the number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas in 2017 amounted to almost 56.6 million, which constitutes an increase by 8.8% in comparison with 2016. [10]. The available movie repertoire in 2018 is indicative of the fact that throughout the whole year the attendance should be similar to that reported in 2017.
3.2 Operating cost
Excluding the cost of impairment of assets, which impacted the Group's results in the fourth quarter of 2017, its total operating costs in 2018 should be significantly lower than those recorded in 2017. It shall be a result of i.a. lower depreciation level, and lower raw material and energy costs. The level of Group's revenues may be impacted by the Group's intention to start developing a network of eateries already in 2018.

3.2.1 Costs of external services
The cost of external services in 2018 will largely depend on the cost of space leasing in advertising, in particular in the Internet segment, costs of film copy purchase related directly to the level of revenue from ticket sales, and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. In addition, the increase in this cost item will be affected by opening of new cinema facilities in 2018, and fees for film producers related to the Group's film distribution business and execution of other development projects.
3.2.2 Staff cost
Based on the Company's estimates, the staff costs in 2018 will be slightly higher than in 2017. It will rise in the Movies and Books segment, mainly due to the development of the Helios cinema network, and the opening of new movie theatres. The staff costs increase has also been planned in the Radio and Internet segments. The collective redundancies in Agora S.A. carried out in 2016 (mainly in the Press segment), and resignation from the publishing of some press titles will keep up impacting this cost entry. In addition, in February 2018 the Company announced a group lay-offs process in the Print segment. Therefore, the Group's results will be burdened with a PLN 1.6 million provision in the first quarter of 2018. The estimated savings from the restructuring process will amount to, throughout the year, approximately PLN 2.0-2.5 million.
3.2.3 Promotion and marketing cost
In 2018, Agora Group is planning to implement more development activities, which include promotional activities. The dynamics of changes in individual media, the number of launched development projects as well as market activities of the Group's competitors may affect the level of these expenses. Considering the above factors, the Company estimates that in 2018 this cost item may increase.
3.2.4 Cost of raw materials and energy
According to the Company, 2018 will see this item shaped by market trends similar to those observed in 2017. The Group's Print segment has the largest impact on this cost item, especially the cost of production materials, the volume of production and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. The Company estimates that due to a reduction in the volume of printed titles, the value of this cost item will be lower in 2018.
4. THE GROWTH DIRECTIONS OF THE AGORA GROUP
Development in the media market remains the most important objective of the Company. The Group wants to achieve it rising its revenues and streamlining its profitability in line with the medium term development plans announced in March 2014. The key to pursuing these goals is execution of a few most important tasks, the most significant of which are the digital transformation of the Company's press business, and the improved profitability of the Group's remaining businesses.
Agora Group has been successfully implementing its press business digital transformation since 2014. There were almost 133 thousand digital subscriptions in the Wyborcza.pl service. At the same time, the Company has been optimizing its activities in the areas related to the printed version of the newspaper.
Agora regularly develops its non-press businesses. As for the movie theatre business, the Group aims at expanding its Helios cinema network and increasing the scale of its film operations. In 2017, the Helios cinema network grew larger with the addition of three new cinemas. At the end of the year, it consisted of 44 modern facilities. In the Outdoor Advertising market, Agora wants to reinforce its position in the premium panel segment. The systematic position reinforcement plan in this segment brought about significantly better operating results of AMS S.A. in 2017. Further diversification of revenue sources and better operating results are top priorities in the Group's internet business. The Group's goal in the radio business is to expand technical coverage of the existing stations. As for the operating costs, the Group undertakes systematic optimization initiatives related to shared services and infrastructure services aimed at streamlining and unifying the Group's internal processes.
In 2018 Agora Group plans to enter a completely new segment of the market and together with its partners develop a network of eateries. The first restaurant should be opened in the second half of 2018, whereas during four coming years the Group plans to open approximately 45 eateries.

translation only (1) the amounts do not include revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments; (2) based on invoices booked in the period; (3) reconciling positions show data not included in particular segments, i.a.: other revenues and costs of Agora's supporting divisions (centralized IT, administrative, finance and HR functions, etc.), the Management Board of Agora S.A., Agora TC Sp. z o.o., intercompany eliminations and other matching adjustments, which reconcile the data presented in the management reports to the consolidated financials of the Agora Group.
2.3. Sales and markets
Over 90.0% of the total sales of the Group were related to sales in domestic market. Sales to foreign markets are realized mainly through the sales of printing and advertising services to foreign customers and sales of publications (including foreign subscriptions). The Group does not depend on one particular customer. The biggest customers of the Group (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors and Google (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). In 2017, the value of transactions with none of the distributors exceeded 10.0% of the Group's total revenues.
2.4. Suppliers
The Group does not depend on one particular supplier. Newsprint, printing services and film copy purchase are important cost items of the Group. Newsprint used for printing services for external customers and in order to print the Group's own titles is purchased from several suppliers. In 2017, the value of transactions with none of the suppliers exceeded 10.0% of the Group's total revenues.
2.5. Finance cost, net
Net financial activities of the Group for 2017 were influenced mainly by gain on sale of shares in Green Content Sp. z o.o. and revaluation of the liabilities resulting from put options granted to the non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries. Moreover, the financial activities of the Group were affected by interest from bank deposits and costs of commissions and interest on bank loans and finance lease liabilities. In 2016, finance costs were additionally influenced by the effect of the remeasurement of previously held equity interest in the subsidiary GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. at the date of obtaining control over the company.

The decrease in non-current assets, versus 30 September 2017 and 31 December 2016, resulted mainly from depreciation and amortisation charges and impairment losses of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which were, to some extent, compensated by new investments.
3.2. Current assets
The increase in current assets, versus 30 September 2017, results mainly from the increase in accounts receivable and short-term securities, which was, to some extent, compensated by the decrease in cash and cash equivalents (due to, inter alia, shares buy-back program).
The decrease in current assets, versus 31 December 2016, results mainly from the decrease in cash and cash equivalents (due to, inter alia, shares buy-back program carried out in the fourth quarter of 2017) and the decrease in accounts receivable, which were, to some extent, compensated by the increase short-term securities.
3.3. Non-current liabilities and provisions
The decrease in non-current liabilities and provisions, versus 30 September 2017 and 31 December 2016, stems mainly from the decrease in deffered tax liabilities and the decrease in bank loans and finance lease liabilities. The above changes were, to some extent, compensated by higher put option liabilities.

3.4. Current liabilities and provisions
The increase in current liabilities and provisions, versus 30 September 2017, stems mainly from an increase in trade payables and liabilities related to purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as higher balance of accruals.
The decrease in current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2016, stems mainly from lower balance of trade payables and tax liabilities. Additionally, there was a decrease in financial liabilities related to bank loans, finance lease and cash pooling as well as lower balance of provisions (as a result of the use of the provision for group lay-offs).

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had PLN 111.0 million in cash and short-term monetary assets, which comprised cash and cash equivalents in the amount of PLN 19.2 million and PLN 91.8 million invested in short-term securities. Additionally, as at 31 December 2017 the Group had cash receivables of PLN 21.6 million deposited by AMS S.A. as cash collateral securing the bank guarantees granted in relation to performance of the concession contract for the construction and modernisation of bus/tram shelters in Warsaw (out of which PLN 10.8 million is presented within long-term receivables).
In 2017, Agora S.A. has not been engaged in any currency options or any other derivatives used for speculative purposes.
On the basis of the Credit Line Agreement ("Agreement") with DNB Bank Polska S.A. signed on 25 May 2017 Agora S.A. received a non-renewable loan of PLN 25 million allocated for the repayment of the time credit in Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A., which shall be repaid in 12 quarterly instalments starting from 1 July 2018. Moreover, the Company was provided with a credit facility in the current account of up to PLN 75.0 million ("Overdraft 1") that may be used within 12 months after the date of signing the Agreement to e.g. finance or refinance acquisitions, investment expenditure and the working capital and after 12 months since the date of signing the Agreement will be automatically converted into a non-renewable loan repayable in quarterly instalments. The Company was also provided with a credit facility in the current account of up to PLN 35.0 million ("Overdraft 2") that can be used within 12 months after the date of signing the Agreement to finance the working capital and other corporate purposes of the Company including cash pooling facility.
As at the date of this MD&A report, considering the cash position, the cash pooling system functioning in the Group and available credit facility, the Group does not anticipate any liquidity problems with regards to its further investment plans (including capital investments).

4.1. Operating activities
The decrease in net inflows from operating activities in 2017, as compared to previous year, stems mainly from the changes in working capital of the Group. In 2017 the Group recorded higher outlflows from payments of liabilities and the use of provisions as well as lower inflows from payments of receivables.
4.2. Investment activities
Net outflows from investing activities, in 2017, result mainly from the expenditures on property, plant and equipment and intangibles and net outflows on acquisition of short-term securities, which were to some extent compensated by sales of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from the sale of shares in company Green Content Sp. z o.o.
4.3. Financing activities
Net outflows from financing activities, in 2017, result mainly from the repurchase of own shares, net outflows from bank loans and repayments of finance lease and cash pooling liabilities.

1. REVENUE [3]
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the revenues of the Movies and Books segment increased by 10.0% yoy and amounted to PLN 122.7 million.
Increased revenues from ticket sales in the Helios cinema network, totalling PLN 66.6 million (i.e. 8.8% more than in the fourth quarter of 2016) made the biggest impact on the revenue rise. A contributing factor was the higher number of viewers (up by 8.0% yoy) in Helios cinemas, translating into 3.6 million of sold tickets. Another factor positively affecting the Helios cinema ticket sale revenues was the higher average ticket price. Concession sales amounted to PLN 24.7 million, also showing a significant increase ­ by 10.8% yoy.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Movies and Books segment's total revenue from film co-production and distribution amounted to PLN 4.6 million, showing an increase yoy. In the fourth quarter of 2017, NEXT FILM introduced into cinemas a Polish - British production entitled Loving Vincent (Oscar nomination in the animated film category). At the same time, cinemas kept screening films introduced to the big screen in earlier periods. The Movies and Books segment also recorded revenues from the co-production of films released in earlier periods ­ mainly Sztuka kochania. Historia Michaliny Wislockiej due to its distribution in various channels, and Tarapaty due to its distribution in movie theatres.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the revenues of Agora's Publishing House amounted to PLN 12.2 million, and increased by 11.9% yoy.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Agora's Publishing House issued 12 new books and 8 musical publications. In addition, it sold some titles published by other publishers. In total, 35 books, as well as music and film publications were marketed. As a result, during the analysed period, the Publishing House sold approximately 0.5 million books and books with CDs/DVDs. One of the best-selling titles in the book publishing section was the biography of Anna Przybylska ­ Ania.
In 2017, the revenues of the Movies and Books segment increased by 14.3% yoy to PLN 416.2 million.
Increased revenues from ticket sales in the Helios cinema network, totalling PLN 222.4 million (i.e. up by 14.0% yoy) made the biggest impact on the revenue rise. A contributing factor was the higher number of viewers (up by 13.0% yoy) in Helios cinemas, translating into almost 12.2 million of sold tickets. Yet another one was the higher average price of the ticket. The growing number of movie theatre goers contributed also to the 14.9% yoy increase of concession sale revenues which totalled PLN 83.1 million.
The Movies and Books segment's total revenue from film co-production and distribution amounted to PLN 28.1 million in 2017, showing a considerable increase yoy. In 2017 NEXT FILM released the following Polish productions for cinema distribution: Po prostu przyjazn, Sztuka Kochania. Historia Michaliny Wislockiej, Pokot, Tarapaty, and a Polish - British production entitled Loving Vincent (Oscar nomination in the animated film category). These films attracted considerably more viewers to cinemas compared to those released by the company in 2016. At the same time, cinemas kept screening films introduced to the big screen in earlier periods. The Movies and Books segment also recorded revenue from co-production of the film entitled Sztuka kochania. Historia Michaliny Wislockiej and Karbala due to its distribution in various channels, and Tarapaty due to its distribution in movie theatres.
In 2017, revenues of Agora's Publishing House totalled PLN 36.5 million, i.e. 20.0% less than in 2016. In 2016, this revenue item was highly affected by the sales of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its extensions, and other projects executed within this division, including Titanic, the Exhibition.
In 2017, Agora's Publishing House issued 56 new books, 28 music albums and 10 film publications. In addition, it sold some titles published by other publishers.

One of the best-selling titles in the book publishing section were Sztuka kochania by Michalina Wislocka, and Ania, a biography of Anna Przybylska.
2. COST
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the operating costs of the Movies and Books segment increased by 14.3% yoy and amounted to PLN 114.5 million.
This was affected mainly by an increase in costs of external services (up by 11.9% yoy) totalling PLN 54.6 million, and an increase in staff costs (up by 15.6% yoy) amounting to PLN 14.8 million. An increase in costs of external

services is associated with higher yoy costs of film copy purchases as a consequence of higher attendance at the Helios cinemas. This translated into higher yoy revenues from ticket sales and concession sales. Higher external services result also from higher payments to film producers due to higher attendance at films distributed by Next Film in the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher yoy rental costs resulting from the Helios cinema network development had an impact on the higher yoy costs of external services (in the fourth quarter of 2017, there were three movie theatres more than in the fourth quarter of 2016 - the movie theatre in Wolomin was opened in February 2017, the one in Krosno at the end of September 2017, and the one in Stalowa Wola in December 2017). Higher depreciation resulted from the Helios cinema network development, on the one hand, and on the other, from the one-off shortening of the useful lives of selected cinema projectors in the fourth quarter of 2017. At that time, Helios established a reserve (bigger than in previous periods) for fees payable to copy right collective management organizations.
The increased staff costs amounting to PLN 14.8 million was mainly the result of the increased minimum hourly wage and higher yoy headcount due to a higher number of Helios network cinemas.
A decrease in promotion and marketing costs - down by 15.7% - to PLN 8.6 million, was due to lower yoy activity of NEXT FILM in the area of film distribution in the fourth quarter of 2017.
A 6.5% increase of operating costs of Agora's Publishing House (to PLN 11.4 million) was caused by higher sales and the necessity to print popular books, and pay higher authors' licensing fees.
In 2017, the operating costs of the Movies and Books segment increased by 14.7% yoy to PLN 386.5 million.
This was affected mainly by an increase in costs of external services of 20.8%, totaling PLN 191.9 million, and an increase in staff costs of 31.6%, amounting to PLN 51.6 million. Higher external services result, among other things, from higher payments to film producers due to higher attendance at films distributed by Next Film in 2017. An increase in costs of external services is associated with higher costs of film copy purchases as a consequence of higher attendance at the Helios cinemas. This translated into higher revenues from ticket sales in the Helios cinema network. Another factor affecting higher costs of external services were the increased rent costs in the Helios cinema network. In 2017, the network included 3 more movie theatres, as compared to 2016. The movie theatre in Wolomin was opened in February 2017, the one in Krosno at the end of September 2017, and the one in Stalowa Wola in December 2017. In addition, 4 cinemas opened in the fourth quarter of 2016 were operational throughout 2017. The staff costs rise was mainly caused by the higher minimum hourly wage rate, and the bigger headcount related to the larger number of movie theatres in the Helios cinema network.
As a result of the expansion of the Helios cinema network and higher concession sales, a 9.7% increase (to PLN 34.9 million) was recorded in the costs of raw materials, energy and consumables. The larger number of facilities in the Helios cinema network, coupled with shortening of useful lives of selected cinema projectors, contributed to an increased depreciation in the segment.
However, operating costs of Agora's Publishing House, which amounted to PLN 35.3 million, went down by 22.8% year on year. In the corresponding period of the previous year, the level of the Publishing House's operating costs was significantly affected by the settlement with the producer of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its extensions and other projects executed in the division ­ e.g. Titanic, The Exhibition.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2017, Helios opened three new cinemas: in Wolomin (mazowieckie province) as well as in Krosno and Stalowa Wola (podkarpackie province). This means that the network now has 44 cinemas with 241 screens and over 49 thousand seats, which makes it the largest cinema operator in Poland in terms of the number of facilities. Helios also signed agreements to open new cinema facilities in 3 cities: Legionowo, Pabianice and Zabrze. Their opening is scheduled for 2018 and 2020.
In August 2017, the Helios cinema network was the only one in Poland to invite fans of Game of Thrones, one of the most popular series in the world, to watch the last episode of season 7 on the big screen. Special, free-ofcharge screenings took place in 42 cinemas across Poland and attracted a massive audience. Helios continues to work with television stations ­ later that year, the opening episodes of Belfer (season 2), Wataha (season 2) and Vikings (season 5) were also shown in special screenings.

translation only In December 2017, the Helios cinema network joined Swieto Kina, an action organised across Poland to promote cinematography, cinema-going culture and watching films on the big screen. This was the fourth time that Helios participated in this action. As of 1 April 2017, all of Agora Group's film operations were consolidated under a single organisational structure, i.e. the NEXT FILM company. Previously, Agora's Special Projects division had been responsible for film production and co-production while NEXT FILM had been in charge of distribution. In the first quarter of 2017, Agora premiered its own production: Po prostu przyjazn. In the same period, two films co-produced by Agora hit the big screen: Sztuka Kochania. Historia Michaliny Wislockiej and Pokot. Then, in the third quarter of 2017, NEXT FILM released Tarapaty, which reached a record-breaking opening weekend figure in the segment of Polish family cinema. In the fourth quarter, the company released Loving Vincent, a full-length feature painted animation that has won awards all over the world, being the first production of that kind in the history of cinema. 2017 was the best year in the history of NEXT FILM. Films released to cinemas by the company attracted over 3.251 million viewers. As a result, NEXT FILM became one of the seven largest film distributors in Poland in that period. In the first quarter of 2017, the Belfer criminal series was released on DVD, and Pokot, a film by Agnieszka Holland, premiered in the third quarter. In September 2017, the immensely popular biography of Anna Przybylska, entitled Ania, appeared in bookstores. In September 2017, the new Publio.pl mobile application was launched for the first time for Orange customers who own devices with the Android system. Thanks to the Czytelnia Orange application, they can access the full range of titles available at Publio.pl, i.e. 28,000 e-books, nearly 3,000 audiobooks as well as 350 newspapers and magazines; they can also benefit from special discounts offered by the bookstore.

predominating on the printed press market, but mainly of the partial resignation from the distribution of e-copies of monthlies, owing to the dynamic development of magazines' websites and discontinuation of issuing of the Pogoda na ycie monthly as of the end of 2016.

3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2017, Gazeta Wyborcza started cooperating with several foreign media, expanding its sources of information and technological competences as well as providing more interesting content for its readers. It became a partner of inter alia the French-German Arte television, the German RBB TV, the EURACTIV European news portal and Google. It also started working with The Wall Street Journal, the prestigious American daily. As a result, Polish readers will be able to buy access to the digital edition of the newspaper while "Gazeta Wyborcza" as well as Wyborcza.pl will publish the most interesting articles from WSJ in Polish translation.
in 2017 the Gazeta Wyborcza team continued to expand the digital offer of the daily ­ in spring, a new version of the Gazeta Wyborcza mobile application was launched allowing users to customise content and save selected articles for later, among other features. In August 2017, the Wyborcza.pl website changed the rules of commenting on the content ­ now only subscribers can comment on the articles and take part in content-related discussions on the website. October saw the rollout of two projects launched with the support of Google's Digital News Inititative. The first one - Sonar.Wyborcza.pl ­ a new website that analyses the world and politicians' actions through articles, in numbers and on diagrams. The website, a joint project of Gazeta Wyborcza and Wyborcza.pl, was developed together with Laboratorium EE. Another notable online project, initiated by Wysokie Obcasy and Gazeta Wyborcza and launched with financial support of the Digital News Initiative programme, is the NewsMavens.com website, operating since October 2017.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the operating result of the Outdoor Advertising segment was much higher yoy. It was mainly due to the operating costs reduction which translated into a better operating result of the segment at the EBIT level (up by 39.4% yoy to PLN 9.2 million). The segment also improved the result at the EBITDA level which increased to PLN 15.4 million, and the EBITDA margin increased yoy to 31.9%.
In 2017, as a result of the operating costs reduction, the segment's operating result at the EBIT level increased to PLN 28.3 million, and at the EBITDA level to PLN 47.7 million (up by 14.1% yoy). In 2017, the segment's EBITDA margin rose yoy to 29.3%.
1. REVENUE [8]
As reported by IGRZ (the Outdoor Advertising Chamber), in the fourth quarter of 2017 the value of spending on outdoor advertising increased by 5.5% yoy [8]. In 2017, expenditure in the outdoor advertising market was lower by more than 1.5% yoy.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the value of revenue from advertising sales in the Outdoor Advertising segment remained flat yoy. A positive impact on the AMS' revenue dynamics had the increased advertisers' spending on Premium Citylight panels, and on ad panels in public transport. The end of cooperation with the Warsaw underground exerted a negative impact on the segment's advertising sales revenue.
In 2017, the drop in revenues from AMS advertising sales, amounting to 2.9%, was slightly higher than the expenditure decrease in the outdoor advertising market reported by IGRZ. The dynamics of the advertising sales generated by AMS was adversely affected by ceasing advertising services in Warsaw metro trains.

translation only
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the estimated share of the AMS group in the outdoor ad spend amounted to more than 36.0%, and throughout 2017 - almost 35.5% [8].
2. COST
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the segment's operating costs declined by 6.5% yoy, and amounted to PLN 39.1 million, mainly owing to lower yoy system maintenance costs.
The system maintenance costs reduction by 12.3% yoy resulted mainly from the termination of cooperation with the Warsaw metro with regard to advertising on the panels in metro cars as well as changes in the structure of panel portfolio.
The 1.4% yoy rise of campaign execution costs results from higher yoy commercial campaign revenues executed in the public transport. It stems directly from the purchase of larger number of advertising spaces on the public buses.
The depreciation cost yoy increase results mainly from investment activities in connection with the execution of the concession contracts for the construction and use of bus shelters in Warsaw and Krakow.
The higher yoy value of assets' impairments resulted from the higher one-off write downs regarding the value of construction elements of panels in the warehouse and panels to be disassembled.
In 2017, the segment's operating costs declined by 5.9% yoy, to PLN 134.7 million, mainly owing to lower yoy costs of system maintenance, staff costs and campaigns execution costs..
System maintenance costs reduction by 9.7% yoy in 2017 resulted mainly from the termination of cooperation with the Warsaw metro with regard to advertising on panels in underground cars, as well as changes in the structure of AMS operating costs. As a result of execution of the concession contracts for the construction and use of bus shelters, amortisation costs increased yoy and costs of rental fees were reduced.
The costs of campaign execution decreased by 0.8% yoy due to a decrease in the volume of poster printing services and lower posting costs related to a smaller number of orders.
The decrease in staff costs by 4.4% yoy in 2017 is mainly the consequence of a decrease in the variable components of remuneration as a result of lower level of sales targets execution than in 2016. The creation of a provision for the Group's incentive schemes (lower than in 2016) significantly influenced the value of those costs.
Expenditure on promotion and marketing increased by 2.3% yoy, mainly owing to higher yoy costs of nonprofit/commercial campaigns.
The higher value of asset impairment in 2017 results from the higher one-off write downs regarding the value of construction elements of panels in the warehouse and ad panels to be disassembled.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2017, AMS continued to develop Premium Citylight panels integrated with bus shelters. In the first half of 2017 AMS aprolonged the contract for the operation of 250 bus shelters in Wroclaw for another 3-year period. In the fourth quarter of 2017 over 180 shelters were put into operation in Warsaw and in Krakow, including newly developed designer shelters in the very centre of Krakow. In November 2017, a new model of bus shelters for Poznan was officially presented. The model was developed by AMS in cooperation with municipal authorities. The investment project entitled "Construction and operation of bus shelters in Warsaw" was selected as one of the top ten projects completed under a public and private partnership (PPP) which received awards in the Top Communal Investments 2017 contest held during the European Economic Congress.
In 2017, AMS introduced a new systemic solution and offered an outdoor GIF format to clients: Dynamic Backlight, where the sequence of zonal backlighting of the display panel creates an effect of animation, impossible to achieve on a static poster. AMS also continued to use bus shelters in innovative ways and launched two unique campaigns, "Przystanek: Literatura" and "Przystanek: Wyspiaski", which combined advertising and technology. In bus shelters that were specially prepared for the campaigns, people could connect to WiFi to download informational materials, use mp3 devices installed in the shelters to listen to interesting content and even smell a floral scent reminiscent of frequent motives in the works of Stanislaw Wyspiaski. AMS provided further non-standard

One-off events recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, related to the intangible assets impariments (including i.a. the company goodwill connected with Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o.) of PLN 21.8 million, significantly affected the increased yoy operating costs of the segment.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the costs of external services increased by 8.7% yoy to PLN 21.3 million. The largest impact on the costs increase had the higher yoy costs of advertising space rental incurred by Yieldbird, and the affiliation marketing networks in Agora's Internet Department.

Facebook Audience Network is an advertising network that enables advertisers to expand their campaign audience and reach Facebook users also outside the platform -- via mobile applications and websites on various devices. Also, thanks to the Yieldbird team, Agora's websites met the requirements of the ads.txt standard in October 2017, ensuring greater transparency of using the publisher's advertising inventory. This comes in response to issues occurring in the programmatic ecosystem, related to advertising fraud, and implementation of IAB recommendations in this area.
Importantly, Yieldbird, an Agora Group's company, was developing fast in 2017. It specialises in optimising programmatic advertising revenue and works in over 30 countries across the world.

In April 2017, Yieldbird was the only Polish company nominated for the Best Ad Ops Team category at The Drum Digital Trading Awards. Judges appreciated the ad ops and yield management project that Yieldbird created for MailOnline, the digital branch of Daily Mail, The growing scale of international business and the resulting increase in Yieldbird's revenue were recognised by experts of the 18th edition of Deloitte's Technology Fast 50 Central Europe ranking. The company debuted on the 21st place in the ranking published.
In the first half of 2017, the Goldenline recruitment company started a new service called Jobile which supports recruiters in searching for the best work candidates in the market. The service allows recruiters to reach both passive candidates as well as those actively looking for a new job.

Radio Pogoda, and lower yoy promotion and marketing expenditure in sales area. In the period under analysis, the outlays on the promotion of Radio TOK FM were higher yoy.

The costs of external services declined by 6.3% yoy to PLN 12.0 million. The yoy decrease in this item resulted mainly from lower yoy costs of marketing research. However, in the discussed period, the costs related to the sales of brokerage services for Helios cinemas, reported under external services, were higher yoy. Apart from the advertising brokerage costs and the costs related to the sales of advertising services in Helios cinemas, the external services item also includes rental and lease fees, costs of production services as well as operator fees.

The staff costs decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 by 2.2% yoy to PLN 8.7 million, mainly as a result of the lower costs of training courses and conferences. The costs of incentive plans and variable components of remuneration were higher yoy in the analysed period.

In 2017, the segment's operating costs declined by 3.3% yoy and amounted to PLN 97.3 million. This was caused mainly by reducing the costs of external services, promotion and marketing, and staff costs.

The costs of external services declined by 3.6% yoy to PLN 42.4 million. The decrease in this item resulted mainly from lower costs of air time purchase in third-party radio stations in connection with the advertising brokerage service provided and lower marketing research costs. However, in the discussed period, the costs related with sales brokerage services for Helios cinemas, reported under external services, were higher yoy. Apart from the advertising brokerage costs and the costs related to the sales of advertising services in Helios cinemas, the external services item also includes rental and lease fees, costs of production services as well as operator fees.

The 8.9% yoy reduction (to PLN 13.3 million) of promotion and marketing costs in 2017 resulted mainly from the lower outlays on the promotion of Radio Zlote Przeboje and Radio Pogoda.

There was also a decrease in staff costs (down by 0.9% yoy), which amounted to PLN 31.5 million. This was mainly due to the lower costs of training courses, conferences, and civil & legal agreements. The costs of incentive plans and changeable remuneration elements were higher yoy in the analysed period.

4. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2017, the Agora Radio Group won the National Broadcasting Council's tender for a radio frequency in Gdask. After the Group received the concession in December 2017, it is planning to launch Radio Pogoda in that city in the first quarter of 2018. In early July 2017, a new TOK FM radio station started broadcasting in Tarnowskie Góry. TOK FM is the first news talk radio station in Poland that currently broadcasts in 23 cities. In the period from June to November 2017, TOK FM was the most popular radio station in Warsaw for the first time in its history, according to the data from the Radio Track report, prepared by Kantar Millward Brown.
In the first quarter of 2017, the Radio Group launched an innovative mobile application ­ Mikrofon TOK FM ­ which allows TOK FM Radio listeners to record their own audio commentary and send it to the station. The application, which was developed with support from the Google Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund, can be downloaded from Google Play and AppStore. An innovative digital project of the TOK FM Radio, i.e. Search the Radio, was also granted financial support from the Google DNI in December 2017. This prototype solution should allow for digitalisation of radio content with the use of a self-optimising transcription system.

(1) revenues from services rendered for external customers;
(2) since 2017 the operating costs of the segment related to the production of Gazeta Wyborcza are settled according to an agreed card rate, in contrary to previous years when it was settled by allocation of direct and indirect cost (including D&A) related to its production. The presentation of data for the corresponding periods of time was adjusted accordingly;
(3) the amounts include impairment losses of the segment`s non-current assets.

Both in the fourth quarter of 2017, and throughout the year, the operating result of the Print segment at the EBIT level was affected by impairments of fixed assets amounting to PLN 51.6 million. As a result, the segment's EBIT operating loss totalled PLN 55.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and PLN 63.4 million in 2017.
Due to the smaller production volume, the segment's EBITDA operating result totalled PLN 0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and PLN 8.9 million in 2017 [1].
1. REVENUE
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the segment's revenue from the sales of printing services decreased to PLN 16.7 million. In 2017 it decreased to PLN 94.0 million. The main reason for the drop was lower yoy production volume in the coldset technology resulting from the end of cooperation with some customers, and higher share of print on customer-provided paper compared to the corresponding periods of 2016, particularly in the case of the heatset technology.
2. COST
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the operating cost of the Print segment was significantly higher yoy, and amounted to PLN 74.5 million. The impairment of the segment's asset (at the amount of PLN 51.6 million) was the main factor behind the rise in the level of segment's operating costs. The costs of this impairment also affected negatively the segment's costs in the whole year 2017. Both in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 2017, the costs of

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 43

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only raw materials, energy, and production services significantly decreased yoy, mainly due to the lower yoy production volume, particularly in the coldset technology, and a higher share of printing on paper provided by the customers.
3. RESTRUCTURING PROCESS
On 1 February 2018, the Management Board of Agora S.A. began consultations with the trade union and the employee council regarding group lay-offs in the Print segment in the Agora Group. The reason for the planned restructuring measures, including restrictions on employment, is the ongoing decrease of revenues from sales of printing services in the coldset technology in which Agora Group's printing plants specialize. This trend mainly results from the condition of the press market in Poland ­ the main client of the Company's coldset printing plants. In 2017, decisions on the resignation from the printing of promotional materials in the coldset technology in favor of another technology, made by some customers outside the press sector, had a significant impact on the decrease of revenues from this business. Services commissioned by clients from other market segments, including those realised in the heatset technology, present a significantly smaller share in the Group's print activity; due to infrastructural constraints, they never did, nor are able to, compensate for the decrease in revenue from coldset printing services. Therefore, the Management Board of the company decided that it is necessary to take decisive restructuring measures aimed at reducing operating costs of printing plants and optimizing the operational processes so as to reduce the negative impact of decrease in print volumes on the financial condition of the Print segment, i.a. by adjusting the employment structure to the current volume of services provided by Agora's printing plants. In pursuance of the agreement reached with the trade union and the employee council, the Group will dismiss up to 53 employees (i.e. 16.3% of the segment workforce, including 1.9% of Agora S.A. employees, and 17.1% of Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. employees, as of 1 February 2018) between 15 February and 16 March 2018. The estimated cost of the provision for group lay-offs ahall amount to PLN 1.6 million, weighing down on the Group's result in the first quarter of 2018. The estimated savings from the restructuring process will amount to, throughout the year, to approximately PLN 2.0-2.5 million. The final amounts will be provided in the first quarter 2018 report.

NOTES
[1] The performance measure "EBIT" represents net operating profit/(loss) defined as net profit/(loss) in accordance with IFRS before finance income and costs, share of results of equity accounted investees and income taxes.
The performance measure "EBITDA" is defined as EBIT increased by depreciation and amortization and impairment losses of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets*.
*impairment losses are included in the calculation of EBITDA since the fourth quarter of 2017, comparative amounts were adjusted accordingly.
In the Management Board opinion, EBITDA constitutes a useful supplementary financial indicator in assessing the performance of the Group and its operating segments. It should be taken into account, that EBIT and EBITDA are not measures determined by IFRS and have not a uniform standard of calculation. Accordingly, their calculation and presentation by the Group may differ from that applied by other companies.
EBIT and EBITDA of Press, Internet, Movies and Books as well as Print segments are calculated on the basis of cost directly attributable to the appropriate operating segment of the Agora Group and excludes allocations of all Company's overheads (such as: cost of Agora's Management Board and a majority of cost of the Company`s supporting divisions), which are included in reconciling positions.
Moreover, EBIT of particular operating segments does not include depreciation and amortisation recognised on consolidation as described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
[2] the data on ticket sales in the cinemas comprising Helios group come from the accounting data of Helios reported in accordance with full calendar periods.
[3] The data refer to advertising expenditures in six media (press, radio, TV, outdoor, Internet, cinema). In this MD&A Agora has corrected the numbers for dailies in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the first, second and third quarter of 2017, and the data for TV in the first and in the second quarter of 2016 and in the third quarter of 2017; the data for Internet in each of the quarters of 2016 and in the first, second and third quarter of 2017; the data for advertising expenditure in cinema was corrected for the first, second and third quarter of 2017.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, press and radio advertising market data referred to herein are based on Agora's estimates adjusted for average discount rate and are stated in current prices. Given the discount pressure as well as advertising time and space sell-offs, these figures may not be fully reliable and will be adjusted in the consecutive reporting periods. In case of press, the data include only display advertising, excluding classifieds, inserts and obituaries. The estimates are based on rate card data obtained from the following sources: Kantar Media monitoring, Agora S.A. monitoring.
Presented TV, Internet and cinema figures are based on initial Starcom media house estimates; TV estimates include regular ad broadcast and sponsoring with product placement, exclude teleshopping and other advertising forms.
Internet ad spend estimates include display, search engines (Search Engine Marketing), e-mail marketing and video advertising.
Outdoor advertising figures are based on Izba Gospodarcza Reklamy Zewnetrznej estimates [8].
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on the average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media.
[4] The data on the number of copies sold (total paid circulation) of daily newspapers is derived from the National Circulation Audit Office (ZKDP). The term "copy sales" used in this MD&A is consistent with the sales declarations of publishers to the National Circulation Audit Office.
The data on dailies readership are based on PBC General, research carried out by MillwardBrown on a random, nationwide sample of Poles over 15 years of age. The CCS index was used (weekly readership index) - percentage of

13. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk
Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2017, advertisers spent over 2.0% yoy more on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in almost all advertising market segments. The erosion of advertising expenditure was observed only in press.
It should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.
Polish economy is sensitive to coutries political situation and looping risk of abrupt legislative changes, whose full impact on the conditions of running business activity in Poland is hard to foresee.

Seasonality of advertising spending
The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's advertising revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year.
Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarter.

Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market
The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting almost half of the advertising market expenditure (47.0%) in 2017. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 31.5% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted 5.0% and 2.5% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2017, 5.5% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted 7.0% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2018 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.
Abrupt changes to law regulations in particular business areas may affect not only macroeconomic situation in Poland but also the propensity and the way advertisers (including state owned companies) spend advertising budgets.
Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content by means of metered paywall on websites related to Gazeta Wyborcza. At the end of 2017, the number of Gazeta Wyborcza active paid subscriptions totalled almost 133 thousand. Nowadays the Company focuses on the growth of average revenue from each subscription and growth of online advertising revenues. It is hard to predict if the Company will be able to deliver above expectations, because of the competitive internet market.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive and number of internet users in Poland is not growing so fast as in the past. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. The development of this medium is also determinated by the available infrastructure. The number of mobile internet users is increasing. Both, changes in the internet usage and increase of internet speed may also affect growth dynamics of individual segments of the internet advertising market. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged. Additionally, online advertising market is
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 62

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
undergoing transformation. Search advertising and social media are becoming more popular among advertisers. Therefore the position of global platforms as Facebook and Google is increasing and they are the main beneficiaries of online advertising market growth in Poland. The Group's main source of Internet advertising revenue is display advertising. Programmatic, video and mobile advertising are also growing their share. Maintenance of the strong position in rapidly changing market requires investment in advanced technological solutions. Due to that fact there is no guarantee that the Group will be able to compete with national and foreign players with larger financial resources.
Responsibility for published content
The Group's activity is based in its many aspects on publishing the content created by journalists, writers, publicists or users of Internet forums. This can result in publisher's responsibility or co-responsibility for distribution of information contradictory to law regulations, including infringement of personal interests. It cannot be ruled out, that the Group could unintentionally violate such lawsand as a result it could be a subject of claims relating to that and as a result it may have to pay relevant compensations.
Outdoor
Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
On September 11, 2015 selected regulations on strengthening landscape protection changed. On its basis the local governments acquired rights to regulate the distribution of visual advertisement and small architecture in public space and charging adequate fees and potential fee penalties. It is really hard to estimate the impact of this regulation on the Agora Group's results. Till the day of this publication 3 local government introduced new rules of charging fees which did not affect the results of AMS.
In 2014, execution of the contract to construct of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw commenced. As of the day of this report there are 21 bus shelters to be built. AMS is acquiring proper administrative approvals in order to construct those bus shelters. The finish of bus shelters construction and settlement of the investment process with the Grantor is planned in the secondo quarter of 2018.
Cinema
Helios opens new cinemas in shopping and entertainment centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping and entertainment galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators.
Additionally, the available repertoire affects results of cinema business. Lack of interesting movies, abilities to promote movies or the quality of movies may negatively affect cinema admissions. Moreover, economic downturn may translate into lower expenditure on entertainment which may result in lower revenues from ticket sales and willingness to buy food and beverages in cinema bars.
Moreover, the ban of Sunday trading introduced on selected Sundays since March 2018 may affect the business routine of shopping centres and result in drop of revenues from cinema activity of the Group. Additionally, this regulation may change the policy of setting the rental fees, especially in shopiing centres to be opened after March 1, 2018. It may have a negative impact on the results achieved by cinemas operating in shopping centres.
Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, in Internet.
Risks of running licensed business
The Group has been running its activities in radio market for years and since 2014 it started to operate in TV market. Radio and TV operations are licensed activity in Poland. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 63

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
There is a risk that demand, from radio and TV audience, for a certain radio or TV format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
Additionally, KRRiT initialized the consultation among business activities in the licensed area. It is difficult to predict what will be the outcome, and how it will affect the results and operations of the Company and the Group.
Additionally, there is a risk that, the Group may not fulfill the disposition of concession or regulations, especially in relation to programme content or cease the broadcasting of the programme which may result in sanctions from KRRiT.
It cannot be ruled out that KRRiT will refuse to grant the concession the Group again, after the time for which they had been granted previously, or the conditions of newly granted concessions (or contracts related to those concessions) will be less beneficial from the Group's perspective.
Radio stations
Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora Group's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
Additionally, radio stations compete for audience with other media, especially with Internet.
Television
Due to the purchase of 41.04% stake in Stopklatka S.A. by Agora on March 12, 2014 the Group entered television market. Our television channel competes with existing television broadcasters and potential new market entrants. Among Stopklatka TV competitors there are larger broadcasters with better brand recognition and financial resources than us. Stopklatka competes also with other media, including Internet oraz growing popularity of VOD services and other platforms enabling watching video materials in Internet.
In 2017 Agora sold its stake in Green Content Sp. z o.o.(broadcaster of TV programme METRO) and ceased to be a shareholder of the company.
Movie business
Movie distribution and co-production is of project nature, which may result in volatitility of its results ­ it may also impact the Group's results. The majority of costs incurred, especially those related to movie co-production, burdens the Group results long before the profits related to that fields of operations. The impact of this activity on the Group's results depends also on the popularity of given film production.
Risk of claims as a rusult of intellectual property rights infringement
The Group's activity is based in its many aspects on using the intellectual property rights and on license agreements. In the Group's opinion it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of the third parties. However, it cannot be ruled out that the Group may unintentionally violate such laws. As a result the Group could be a subject of claims and could be forced to pay relevant compensations.
Risk of rapid changes in law regulations, especially those relating the Group's operations
Due to the fact that legal regulations in Poland change quite often, they may negatively impact the Group's operations and carry risk in business operations. This risk is especially associated with regulations that directly influence the day-to-day business, including those related the processing of personal data, changes to the Broadcasting Act and the regulations implementing those changes, Copyright and related rights Act, as well as acts regulating capital market in Poland and rules of commercial activities in Poland.
New regulations may pose a risk due to the problems with their interpretation, lack of judicial practice, unfavourable interpretations adopted by courts or public institutions.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 64

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Additionally tax regulations in Poland are subjetc of often changes. Changes in VAT and other kinds of tax burden may negatively impact the operations and financial results of the Group. The Group is also a subject of risk in changes of tax rules interpretation by tax organs which may affect operations and financial results of the Group.
Impairment tests
Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.
Currency risk
The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the production materials and services and IT services, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
Interest rate risk The changes in interest rates may influence the level of the Group's financial cost related to the Group's debt.
Risk of losing key employees
The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
The risk of collective dispute On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., AMS S.A., Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o. and Grupa Radiowa Agory Sp. z o.o. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.
Risk related to functioning within tax capital group (TCG)
Functioning within TCG requires from Agora S.A. the obligation to maintain at least 75% of shares in subsidiary companies which are part of the TCG, for the period of validity of the TCG. Given the changes in the market environment and the execution of Agora's Group strategy, a necessity may arise of change in the ownership structure. In the case of decrease of share in any of the subsidiary companies below the threshold of 75%, the TCG status shall be lost retroactively. This may result in loss of savings, growth of costs of tax year closing and the necessity to prepare additional documents for transfer prices.
What is more, functioning within the TCG imposes on the organization a whole range of statutory requirements, such as, for example, obtaining at least a 2% level of TCG's tax profitability. Based on the financial forecasts prepared as at the date of establishing the TCG, the Company expects that all statutory requirements will be met throughout the duration of the TCG. Considering that the future financial results of companies included in the TCG depend on a number of factors, parts of which the Company is not able to predict or reliably estimate at the moment, it is uncertain whether, during the entire TCG operation, a group of eight companies forming it, it will be able to meet the requirements related to maintaining the profitability threshold described above, except that failure to meet the profitability condition will not result in a retroactive loss of benefits resulting from TCG.

Risk related to print activity
Changes in the way media are consumed, and in particular the popularity of digital media, mean that the demand for printing services is decreasing. It is reflected in the decreasing volume of orders and dropping revenues. Oversupply of production capacities and strong price pressure on the print market may result in a further outflow of customers and a decrease of revenues of print businesses of the Agora Group. The printing plants of the Group specialize in printing services in the coldset technology. The main customers include publishers of dailies, weeklies and retail chains. They also print Agora's Gazeta Wyborcza. The Agora Group's printing houses also offer heatset printing services. However, they constitute a smaller share in the entire printing production of the Agora Group and may not be able to compensate for the decreases related to production in the coldset technology.
14. FACTORS AND UNUSUAL EVENTS WHICH HAD INFLUENCE ON THE RESULTS OF BUSINNESS ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 WITH THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR INFLUENCE
A positive impact on the Agora Group results in 2017 had an execution of an option by Discovery Polska Sp. z o.o. regarding 51.06% share in the company Green Content Sp. z o.o. on September 1st, 2017. As a result of an option execution Discovery Polska Sp. z o.o. became an owner of 100.0% shares in Green Content Sp. z o.o., whereas Agora ceased to be a stakeholder of Green Content Sp.z o.o. The above trascation had a positive impact on the net result of Agora S.A. and the Agora Group of PLN 11.1 million and PLN 11.4 million, respectively. A most significant negative impact on the Agora Group results had an impairment loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the amount of PLN 88.9 million. They affected mainly Print, Internet and Press segments of the Group. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Group reviewed the useful lives of selected fixed assets, which resulted in higher amortization write-offs in Movies and Books segment as well as in general costs of the Agora Group (not attributed to any of the business segments) in total amount of PLN 4.8 million.
15. LEGAL ACTIONS CONCERNING LIABILITIES OR DEBTS OF THE ISSUER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH AMOUNT IN SINGLE OR IN TOTAL TO AT LEAST 10% OF THE AGORA'S SHARE CAPITAL
In 2017, there were no legal actions against Agora S.A. or its subsidiaries related to their liabilities or debts whose total value would amount to at least 10% of Agora's share capital in a single or in all legal proceedings.
16. INFORMATION ON PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
In the current report of September 26, 2017, the Management Board of Agora S.A. announced its offer to buy up to 1,191,635 (in words: one million one hundred and ninety-one thousand six hundred and thirty-five) shares of the Company, corresponding to no more than a total of 2.50% of the Company's share capital as at the offer announcement date ("Offer").
The Offer was announced in order to implement the Own Share Buyback Program on the terms and conditions set out in Resolution No. 19 of the Ordinary General Meeting of the Company held on June 21, 2017, on the adoption of an own share buyback program of the Company ("Resolution"). The contents of the Resolution were published in the form of current report no. 10/2017 of June 21, 2017.
All of the Company's shareholders were entitled to participate in the Offer. The Offer authorized the Company to buy back up to 1,084,595 (in words: one million eighty-four thousand five hundred and ninety-five) bearer shares listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and no more than 107,040 (in words: one hundred and seven thousand and forty) registered shares which, as at the Offer announcement date, corresponded to, respectively, no more than 2.28% and no more than 0.22% of the Company's share capital. The offered purchase price per share was PLN 20.00, and it was the same for registered and bearer shares. Under the Resolution, the Company allocated up to PLN 23,832,713 (in words: twenty-three million eight hundred and thirty-two thousand seven hundred and thirteen Polish zlotys) for the purchase of the shares subject to the Offer.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 66

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
On the basis of the Resolution, the Company was authorized to buy, under one or more offers, no more than 1,537,594 (in words: one million five hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred and ninety-four) shares which corresponded to no more than 3.23% of the Company's share capital. The authorization to buy the own shares back was granted to the Company's Management Board for the period to the earlier of December 31, 2017 and the exhaustion of the reserve allocated for the implementation of the Share Buyback Program (including the acquisition costs), i.e. PLN 23,832,713 (in words: twenty-three million eight hundred and thirty-two thousand seven hundred and thirteen Polish zlotys). Considering that the Resolution provided for the minimum and maximum purchase price of the Company's shares of PLN 15.50 per share and PLN 20.00 per share, respectively, and the fact that the final share purchase price was set at PLN 20.00 (in words: twenty Polish zlotys), the final number of the Company's shares to be purchased under the Offer was set at 1,191,635, so that the total price for the purchase of the shares would not be higher than the reserve allocated for the implementation of the Own Share Buyback Program. The offers to sell shares were accepted from the Company's shareholders from October 2, 2017 to October 6, 2017. All the transactions were settled on October 10, 2017. Millennium Dom Maklerski S.A. managed the Offer and its settlement. Detailed information about the rules of the own share buyback and the reply procedure was included in the Offer which was published on the Company's website, www.agora.pl.
In the current report of October 10, 2017, the Management Board of Agora S.A. informed that on October 10, 2017 the Company bought a total of 1,084,595 own shares as part of the implementation of the Own Share Buyback Program. All the purchased shares were bearer shares listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with a nominal value of PLN 1.0 each, and (as at October 10, 2017) corresponded to a total of 2.28% of the Company's share capital and a total of 1,084,595 votes at the General Meeting of the Company, which represented 1.67% of the total number of votes at the General Meeting of the Company ("Purchased Shares"). The purchase price was PLN 20.0 per Purchased Share and PLN 21,691,900 in total for all the Purchased Shares. The number of bearer shares offered by the shareholders for sale under the Offer totalled 29,131,971. The shareholders did not offer any registered shares for sale. Since the total number of the bearer shares offered by the shareholders for sale under the Own Share Buyback Program exceeded the total number of shares which the Company had intended to buy under the Offer (i.e. 1,084,595 shares) from the pool of the bearer shares, the number of shares purchased from individual shareholders was calculated in accordance with the share offer reduction rules, described in detail in point 10 of the Offer. The average reduction rate applied to the pool of the bearer shares was 96.3%. Before the purchase of the Purchased Shares under the Own Share Buyback Program, the Company did not have any own shares. At present, the Company holds only the Purchased Shares. In accordance with the applicable laws, the Company does not exercise the shareholders' rights attached to its own shares. The Company plans to redempt the purchased shares at the next general meeting of shareholders.
17. DIVISIONS OF THE COMPANY AND OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
Agora S.A. has 19 divisions and the major headquarters in Warsaw. Other companies from the Group do not have local divisions.
18. THE MANAGEMENT BOARD'S STATEMENT OF THE REALIZATION OF FORECASTS
The Management Board did not publish any forecasts of the Group's financial results and because of that this report does not present any Management Board's statement of the realization of them, as well as any differences between actual and forecasted financial results.
19. ISSUING OF SECURITIES

The reason for the planned restructuring measures, including restrictions on employment, is the ongoing decrease of revenues from sales of print services in the coldset technology in which Agora Group's printing plants specialize. This trend mainly results from the condition of the press market in Poland - the main client of the Company's coldset printing plants. Services commissioned by clients from other market segments, including those realized in the heatset technology, present a significantly smaller share in the Group's print activity; due to infrastructural constraints, they never were, nor are able to compensate the decrease of revenues from coldset printing services.
Considering the current condition of the press market as well as negative forecasts regarding the prospects for its further development and progressive digitization of the media, it is not possible to stop the downward trend in the coldset printing business. Therefore, the Management Board of the Company decided that it is necessary to take decisive restructuring measures aimed at reducing operating costs of the printing plants and optimizing the operational processes so as to limit the negative impact of decrease of the number of volumes of print on the financial condition of the Print segment, i.a. by adjusting the employment structure to the current volume of services provided by Agora's printing plants.
The intention of the Management Board of Agora S.A. was to lay off up to 53 employees of the Print segment of Agora Group (which is 16.3% of employees of this segment - including 1.9% of employees in the Company and 17.1% of employees of Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., as at February 1st, 2018) between February 21st and March 23rd, 2018.
The Company shall go through these difficult changes in a thought out manner and with care for its employees, offering the dismissed employees a range of protective and supportive initiatives.
On February 1st, 2018 the Management Board of the Company requested the trade unions operating at the Company and the Company's works council to join in the consultation on collective redundancy process and provided the relevant Labor Office with information on the intention to execute group layoffs in the Company.
In the current report of February 7, 2018 The Management Board of Agora S.A., in relation to regulatory filing no. 3/2018 dated February 1st, 2018, informed about:
(i) concluding on February 7th, 2018 a trilateral agreement ("Agreement") with trade unions operating at the Company (which fulfills the provisions of article 3, Section 1 of the Act of March 13th, 2003 on Special Rules for Termination of Employment for Reasons Not Attributable to Employees) and with work council in the Company (which constitutes an agreement in accordance with the Act of April 7th, 2006 on informing and consulting employees),
(ii) adopting by the Management Board of the Company on February 7th, 2018 resolution to execute collective redundancies in the Print segment of the Agora Group, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.
The collective redundancies shall be executed from February 15th, 2018 until March 16th, 2018, and shall affect up to 53 employees of the Print segment of the Agora Group, i.e. ca 16.3% of all employees of the segment.
In accordance with the agreement, the laid-off employees will be provided by the Company with a wider range of supportive measures than required by law. The redundancy payment estimated according to law regulations shall be increased by indemnity in the amount equal to one additional monthly salary. The laid-off employees shall be supported by additional protective measures provided by the Company, inter alia, help in searching for new job or reskilling. Employees who will remain employed in the Print segment will have their basic remuneration increased, inter alia, due to the changed scope of duties. The Company, in accordance with requirements of law, shall submit an appropriate set of information, together with the signed Agreement, to a relevant Labor Office.

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
decides how to respond to such information in the most effective way ­ whether by publishing a statement on the Company's corporate website or by using other, selected solutions, where such solutions are considered more appropriate due to the nature of the information and the circumstances in which such information is published.
The Company makes every effort to prepare and publish periodic reports as soon as possible after the end of a reporting period, taking into account the complexity of the Company's capital structure. The Management Board of Agora S.A. regularly meets with representatives of the capital market and the media at meetings held after the publication of quarterly results. These meetings are also broadcast online so as to enable all those who could not appear personally to follow the course of such a meeting, as well as to ask questions by e-mail.
3.2. Best practices for management boards of listed companies and members of supervisory boards
The Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board act in the interest of the Company. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board have members who represent high qualifications and experience.
Serving on the Management Board of the Company is the main area of the professional activity of Management Board members. The division of responsibilities for individual areas of the company's activity among Management Board members is published by the Company on its corporate website. As part of the division of responsibilities among the Management Board members in 2017, one of them also served as the President of the Management Board of a subsidiary ­ Helios S.A. ­ included in the business segment directly supervised by that member. Another member of the Management Board was also a member of the Management Board of Stopklatka S.A., i.e. a subsidiary supervised by that member on behalf of Agora S.A. In the opinion of the Management Board, this supports the effective implementation of the development plan of both these companies and the entire enterprise of the issuer.
The Company's Supervisory Board has no control over the selection of candidates to the Management Board of the Company. Candidates for members of the Management Board are nominated by shareholders holding series A shares, while the Management Board members are appointed by the General Meeting (with the reservation that Management Board members may be co-opted in accordance with the Statutes). Nevertheless, when assessing the performance of individual members of the Management Board after the end of each financial year, the Supervisory Board discusses the professional plans with each of the Management Board members in order to ensure efficient operations of the Management Board.
Members of Agora's Supervisory Board represent diversified fields of expertise and many years of professional experience allowing them to look at issues related to the Company's and the Group's operations from a broader perspective. Supervisory Board representatives are able to devote the time necessary to perform their duties. If a Supervisory Board member resigns or is unable to perform his or her duties, the Company immediately takes steps necessary to ensure substitution or replacement on the Supervisory Board, provided that members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting. In accordance with requirements of the Code of Best Practice, at least two members of the Supervisory Board meet the criteria of being independent.
Members of the Company's Supervisory Board receive all necessary information on the Company's and Group's operations on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Company allows its Supervisory Board to use professional and independent advisory services (taking into account the Company's financial position) necessary for the Supervisory Board to exercise effective supervision in the Company.
The Supervisory Board of Agora did not depart from any of the Good Practices applied by members of the supervisory boards. As part of its responsibilities, the Board prepares a brief assessment of the Company's standing, including an evaluation of the internal control, risk management and compliance systems and the internal audit function. The aforesaid assessment covers all significant controls, in particular financial reporting and operational controls. This assessment is published by the Company together with all materials related to the general meeting on the Company's corporate website.
At the same time, the Supervisory Board reviews and issues opinions on matters to be discussed at the general meeting. Representatives of the Supervisory Board always participate in the General Meeting in a composition enabling them to answer any questions from shareholders, to the extent permitted by the applicable law. In 2017, the Supervisory Board was represented at the General Meeting by its Chairman, Mr Andrzej Szlzak.

Each year, the Supervisory Board also prepares a report on its activities in the financial year. The Board will also prepare the report on its activities in 2017. This report will comprise information on: composition of the Board and its Committees, the Board members' fulfilment of the independence criteria, number of meetings of the Board and its Committees in the reporting period and self-assessment of the Supervisory Board's performance. The Supervisory Board will also present its assessment of the company's compliance with the disclosure obligations concerning compliance with the corporate governance principles defined in the Exchange Rules and the regulations on current and periodic reports published by issuers of securities, as well as an assessment of the rationality of the company's policy for sponsorship, charity or other similar activities or information about the absence of such policy.
Where there is any relationship between a member of the Supervisory Board and any shareholder who holds at least 5% of the total vote in the company, such member notifies the Company's Management Board and other members of the Supervisory Board of this fact. The same applies if there is a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest.
3.3. General meeting and shareholder relations
At present, securities issued by the Company are traded only on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, hence all the Company's shareholders acquire their rights on the same dates in accordance with the Polish legal system. All shareholders have the same rights as far as the transactions and contracts executed between the Company and its shareholders or related entities are concerned. In the event of amendments to the rules of the general meeting, the Company endeavours to do so in good time in order to enable all shareholders to exercise their rights, and the Company strives to ensure that the amendments to the rules of the general meeting take effect at the earliest as of the next general meeting.
The Company also makes every effort (including determination of the venue and date of the general meeting) to ensure the participation of the highest possible number of shareholders in the general meeting. The Company informs without delay about any changes concerning the organization of the general meeting, including any changes to the agenda of the general meeting. Agora also enables media representatives to participate in the general meeting of the Company.
The Company strives to hold an ordinary general meeting as soon as possible (taking also into account the organization of the Agora Group's operations) after the publication of an annual report and set the date in keeping with the applicable legislation. On 21 June 2017, the Company's General Meeting, convened at the request of the Management Board, was held at its registered office in Warsaw, and all documents related to its organization and course, including the recording of video broadcasts, were published on the Company's corporate website. The meeting was held in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code and the Rules of the General Meeting. Members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board as well as the statutory auditor were present during the general meeting and were ready to provide explanations within the scope of their competences and legal regulations. In the case of questions from shareholders and answers given to them during the course of the general meeting, they are available to the public via real-time broadcasting of the general meeting. In addition, if necessary, the Company prepares a list of questions asked before and during the general meeting and answers to such questions. The questions are answered by representatives of the Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board present at the general meeting.
During the Ordinary General Meeting of the Company held in 2017, no amendments were made to the rules of the General Meeting and the Company's Statutes.
The General Meeting approved the Company's annual separate and consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2016 and the Management's Report on the Company's activities in the financial year 2016.
The General Meeting determined the number of members of the Supervisory Board of the term of office commencing with its conclusion at 6 persons, appointing Dariusz Formela, Tomasz Sielicki, Wanda Rapaczyski, Andrzej Szlzak, Anna Maria Kryska-Godlewska and Andrzej Dobosz to the Supervisory Board.
In 2017, the General Meeting hereby approves the appointment of Agnieszka Sadowska to the Management Board which took place by co-optation on 1 March 2017.

In 2017, the Ordinary General Meeting also adopted a resolution on covering the net loss from the Company's supplementary capital and authorized the Management Board to acquire the Company's treasury shares for subsequent redemption. For this purpose, the General Meeting allocated the amount of PLN 23,832,713 from the supplementary capital to a reserve fund created to execute the buy-back of treasury shares.
On 8 November 2017, an Extraordinary General Meeting was also held. It was convened at the request of the Management Board, held at its registered office in Warsaw, and all documents related to its organization and course, including the recording of video broadcasts, were published on the Company's corporate website. The meeting was held in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code and the Rules of the General Meeting.
The Extraordinary General Meeting appointed Anna Kryska-Godlewska and Grzegorz Kania to the Management Board of Agora for a joint term of office which will expire on the date of the General Meeting approving the financial statements for 2017.
For several years, the Company has provided real-time broadcast of the general meeting in Polish and in English. During both general meetings held in 2017, the Company provided shareholders with the possibility of bilateral real-time communication using electronic means of communication via a dedicated e-mail address. Due to significant financial and technological expenditure and potential legal doubts, the Company does not enable shareholders to exercise, in person or by proxy, their voting rights during the general meeting using electronic means of communication.
The Company strives to comply with all detailed rules concerning the general meeting and shareholder relations indicated in the Code of Best Practice.
4. OPERATION AND KEY POWERS OF THE GENERAL MEETING, SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS AND THE MANNER OF THEIR EXERCISE
The General Meeting of Agora ("GM") acts on the basis of the Commercial Companies Code and Agora's Statutes. Pursuant to Section 16(2) of the Statutes, the GM may adopt the Rules of the General Meeting, setting out the rules of its operation. The adoption, amendment or revocation of the Rules require three-quarters of the votes cast to be valid. The Rules of the GM is available at URL: https://www.agora.pl/en/general-meeting-ofshareholders. The GM is convened in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Commercial Companies.
Resolutions of the General Meeting are passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast unless the Code of Commercial Companies or the Statutes provide otherwise. Pursuant to § 15(2) of the Statutes, resolutions concerning a merger of the Company with another entity, other forms of consolidation that are or will be allowed under law, division of the Company, remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board, including individual remuneration of those members who were elected to a continuous supervisory, are adopted by a majority of three-quarters of votes cast. The majority of three-quarters of votes cast when the shareholders representing at least 50% of the Company's share capital are present, is required for resolutions on the removal of matters from the agenda of the general meeting that were previously contained in the agenda. In the event a motion for such removal is submitted by the Company's Management Board, an absolute majority of votes cast is required in order to adopt such a resolution. Acquisition or disposal of real property, a perpetual usufruct right or interest in real property does not require the GM's resolution.
Pursuant to § 15(4) of the Statutes, the removal of any matters from the agenda of the general meeting at the request made, on the basis of Article 400 or Article 401 of the Code of Commercial Companies, by a shareholder representing at least such part of the Company's share capital as is indicated in the said provisions, requires consent of the shareholder who made such request. Adoption of a resolution relating to shareholder's liability with respect to the Company due to any reason shall require an majority of three-quarters of votes cast in the presence of shareholders representing at least 50% of all the Company shares conferring the right to vote in the adoption of such resolution.
According to § 17(1) of the Statutes, none of the shareholders may exercise more than 20% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting, provided that for the purposes of establishing obligations of purchasers of material blocks of shares as provided in the Act on Public Offering such restriction of the voting rights does not exist. This restriction of the voting rights does not apply also to:
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 78

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
shareholders holding the preferred series A shares; a shareholder who, while having no more than 20% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting, announced, in accordance with the Act on Public Offering, a tender for subscription for the sale or exchange of all the shares of the Company and in result of such tender purchased shares which, including the previously held Company shares, authorize the said shareholder to exercise at least 75% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting. For the purposes of calculating a shareholder's share in the overall number of votes at the general meeting referred to above, it is assumed that the restriction of the voting rights (up to 20%) does not exist. Pursuant to § 17(5) of the Statutes, at any General Meeting the percentage of votes of foreign entities and entities controlled by foreign entities may not be greater than 49%. The limitation does not apply to entities with their seats or residence in a Member State of the European Economic Area. Each share, whether preferred or not, entitles its holder to one vote in connection with passing a resolution regarding the withdrawal of the Company's shares from public trading. Pursuant to § 7(1) of the Statutes, in addition to registered series A shares, the Company's share capital comprises also ordinary, both registered and bearer, BiD series shares. Series A registered shares are preferred in such a way that each of them carries five votes at the general meeting, subject to the above reservations. Pursuant to § 11(1) of the Statutes, the sale or conversion of preferred series A shares into bearer shares requires the written consent of shareholders holding at least 50% of the preferred series A shares registered in the share register on the date of filing the request for a permit for sale or conversion of preferred series A shares into bearer shares. Within 14 days from the date of receipt of the request, the Management Board is obliged to deliver a copy of the request to each holder of preferred series A shares who are authorized to express their consent, to the address of each shareholder registered in the share register. Candidates for members of the Supervisory Board may be nominated by shareholders holding preferred series A shares or shareholders who documented their entitlement to not less than 5% of the votes at the last general meeting before the candidates were nominated and who, at the time of making the nomination, hold not less than 5% of the Company's share capital (§ 21(1)(a) of the Statutes). Where a member of the Supervisory Board tenders his/her resignation, other Supervisory Board members may appoint by means of co-optation a new member who will perform his/her duties until the general meeting appoints a Supervisory Board member, however no longer than until the end of the common term of office of the Supervisory Board. Dismissal (removal) of a member of the Supervisory Board prior to the end of the common term of office of the Supervisory Board may be effected by a resolution of the general meeting adopted by a simple majority of votes, provided that until the expiry of the preferred status of series A shares 80% of voting rights attached to all outstanding series A shares are cast in favour of such resolution. Information on powers of the general meeting and rights of shareholders to appoint and dismiss the Management Board members is provided further in this document. Bearer shares may not be converted into registered share. The rights of the Company's shareholders, including minority shareholders, are exercised to the extent and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Code of Commercial Companies.

Each of the series A shares carries 5 votes at the General Meeting and the restriction of the voting rights (according to which none of the shareholders may exercise more than 20% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting ­ pursuant to § 17 (1)) does not apply to shareholders holding the preferred series A shares.

For the purposes of the aforementioned limitation on the voting rights and exception from the limitation provided for in item b), exercise of votes by a subsidiary is treated as the exercise of votes by a parent company as defined in the Act on Public Offering.
At any General Meeting, the percentage of votes of foreign entities and entities controlled by foreign entities may not be greater than 49%. The limitation does not apply to entities with their seats or residence in a Member State of the European Economic Area.

Prior to their publication, consolidated and separate financial statements are also submitted to members of the Audit Committee.

On the other hand, pursuant to the remuneration policy for key managers of the Agora Group adopted in 2015, the remuneration of the Company's Management Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board on the basis of a recommendation from the Human Resources and Remuneration Commission of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board sets objectives and criteria for awarding bonuses to individual members of the Management Board for a given financial year and in a longer perspective. A report on its application is presented later in this document.
The Company's remuneration policy directly supports the implementation of the Agora Group's medium-term growth plans.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 90

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
The Company's remuneration system is based on fixed remuneration and variable remuneration resulting from incentive plans and discretionary bonuses.
The Agora Group's remuneration policy differentiates the level of remuneration according to the position held, performance and competences. This variable part ensures flexibility and adaptability to the employer's needs.
Through the incentive scheme, the objectives closely linked to the Agora Group's medium-term growth plan are forwarded to the managers and to employees, which ensures effective support for Agora's business ventures.
The incentive-based remuneration system for employees and managers consists of a fixed part (base salary), a variable part (including annual bonuses and discretionary awards) and non-wage benefits. Base salary in the Company and Agora Group companies is related to the employee's potential, competence and performance in achieving his or her goals.
The aim of the system is to motivate employees to achieve high performance in their work through the implementation of individual goals and evaluation of attitudes, while the management staff can use it as a tool to motivate employees. The bonus system provides for an annual assessment of the employee's performance, summarising the employee's overall contribution for a given bonus year, indicating areas of strengths and areas that require further development. The annual assessment includes an assessment of the level of accomplishment of individual objectives and attitudes throughout the year, as well as an assessment of the total employee's work in a given bonus year and is the basis for calculating the bonus amount.
Agora also provides employees with non-wage benefits such as co-financing of medical care, cafeteria system or a company car. Employees can also take advantage of employee loans for, inter alia, housing purposes and are also beneficiaries of benefits from the Company's Social Benefits System.
Remuneration policy for members of the Management Board of Agora S.A.

Pursuant to the Statutes, the terms and conditions of contracts and remuneration of the President of the Management Board and other members of the Management Board fall within the competence of the Supervisory Board of Agora; however, the terms and conditions of contracts and remuneration of other members of the Management Board are determined in consultation with the President of the Management Board.
The remuneration system for members of the Management Board of Agora operates on the basis of three elements ­ a fixed part (base salary), a variable part (incentive system and discretionary bonus) and non-wage benefits, the range of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.

Company, the member of the Management Board of Agora S.A. will receive severance pay in the amount equal to

the amount equivalent to 12 times the monthly base salary payable to the member of the Management

Rules for determining the value of the Incentive Plan for 2016-2017

Starting from the second quarter of 2016, Management Board members of the Company participate in an incentive scheme ("Incentive Plan"), on the basis of which, they will be eligible to receive an annual bonus based on two components described below:
(i) the stage of implementation of the target based on the EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The EBITDA target is specified as the EBITDA result (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization/depreciation) to be reached in the given financial year, as determined by the Supervisory Board. The amount of potential bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan depends on the stage of the EBITDA target implementation and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the given financial year;
(ii) the level of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan will depend on the level of Company's share price increase in the future. The share price increase will be calculated as a difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the first quarter of the financial year commencing after the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IQ") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the fourth quarter of the financial year preceding the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IVQ"). If the Average Share Price IQ is lower than the Average Share Price IVQ, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan will not be granted.
The bonus from the Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of a non-market condition, which is the continuation of holding the post of the Management Board member during the year, for which the bonus is due.

The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for the Incentive Plan settlement for the Management Board members are specified in the Supervisory Board's resolution.
As at 31 December 2017, the value of the EBITDA target bonus provision was estimated based on the best estimate of the expected value of implementation of the EBITDA target in 2017 and was recognized in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2017, the value of the provision for the Share Price Increase Target bonus was estimated using the binomial model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ the current share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date as at which the financial statements are prepared. The value was charged to the income statement in proportion to the settlement period of this component of the Incentive Plan.

14. DIVERSITY POLICY
With respect to the recommendation concerning the comprehensiveness and diversity of balanced participation of women and men in the company's governing bodies, the Management Board of the Company points out that it has no influence on the composition of the Company's main governing bodies. Candidates for members of the Supervisory Board may be nominated by shareholders holding preferred series A shares or shareholders who documented their entitlement to not less than 5% of the votes at the last general meeting before the candidates were nominated and who, at the time of making the nomination, hold not less than 5% of the Company's share capital (§ 21(1)(a) of the Statutes). In accordance with § 30 of Agora S.A.'s Statutes, candidates for the Management Board members may be nominated exclusively by shareholders holding preferred series A shares, and following the expiry of the preferred status of all such shares, by the Supervisory Board. In the event that the persons authorized to determine the number of members of the Management Board and to nominate candidates

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 94

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
for such members do not exercise one or both of the above rights, the number of members of the Management Board may be determined by the General Meeting, while each shareholder during such General Meeting may nominate candidates for such members.
Moreover, the Management Board of the Company wishes to stress that according to the Agora Group's diversity policy adopted in December 2015, the main criteria for selection of candidates for all managerial positions, remaining in the competencies of the Management Board, include expertise, experience and skills necessary to perform the function in question. Applying these principles to all employees of the Company and the Group ensures healthy functioning of the organization and accepting new business challenges.
Diversity and openness are values which form an integral part of both the Company's business activities and employment policy. The diversity policy implemented at Agora S.A. is based on Agora's Charter, which was developed jointly between the Company and "Gazeta Wyborcza" daily.
As an employer, Agora S.A. is guided by the principles of equal treatment and counteracting all forms of discrimination, believing that this brings real benefits and supports Agora S.A.'s growth and innovation. One of the objectives of the diversity policy pursued by Agora S.A. is to emphasize the openness of the organization to diversity, which increases the effectiveness of work, builds trust and counteracts discrimination. The diversity practice also aims to fully tap into the potential of employees, their diverse skills, experiences and talents in an atmosphere of respect, support and teamwork.
As an employer, Agora creates an atmosphere at work, which makes employees feel respected, and gives them the sense that they are able to fully realize their professional potential. Agora creates a culture of dialogue, openness, tolerance and teamwork.
In 2016, Agora S.A. introduced a diversity policy which applies to all employees. Its aim is to consistently create a workplace that is free from discrimination, regardless of reasons, and at the same time engages the best specialists who contribute to the company's success. Agora S.A. is an employer who cares for the development of the team through internal and external training. Agora S.A.'s diversity policy is based on overcoming barriers such as age, gender or health status and is guided by the principle that the professional potential of employees is determined by their competence. In this manner, the Company wants to support implementation of its strategy to the best of its abilities and to offer the highest-quality products and services to its consumers.
Supervisory Board
The procedure for the appointment of Supervisory Board members is set forth in the Company's Statutes, other laws and regulations applicable to the Company. The Company has limited impact on the composition of the body supervising its operations. Despite this, the current 6-person composition of the Supervisory Board in 2017 reflected all the ideas underlying
the diversity policy.
Management Board
The procedure of appointing the Management Board is also specified in the Company's Statutes. Only holders of series A shares have the right to appoint candidates for a Management Board member. In the Company's opinion, when presenting candidates, these shareholders took into account, as a decisive criterion, first of all high qualifications, professional experience in the main areas of Agora Group's operations and professional preparation for the position of a member of the Management Board.
Members of the Company's Management Board have complementary experience and competences ­ they are graduates of: Warsaw School of Economics, Warsaw University of Technology University of Silesia, University of Lód, University of Edinburgh, Wroclaw University of Technology, Institute Francais de Gestion, Harvards Business School (professional training courses), University of Economics in Wroclaw, MBA at the Warsaw University of Technology Business School. It is worth emphasizing that the decisive aspect in selecting the governing bodies of the company and its key managers is ensuring versatility and diversity, especially in the area of professional experience, age, education and
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 95

gender. High qualifications, as well as professional and substantive experience and preparation for the performance of a specific function are of decisive importance in this respect.

On 1 March 2017 Agnieszka Sadowska was appointed to the Management Board of Agora S.A., and on 8 November 2017 Anna Kryska-Godlewska was appointed to the Management Board. Thus, there are two women on the Management Board of the Company.

Administrative bodies
The administrative bodies of the Agora Group comprise employees holding managerial positions. The diversity policy for administrative bodies involves the creation of a workplace free from discrimination based on gender, age, origin, health, education, political or religious beliefs, where competence and experience are the basis of the organizational culture. This approach is reflected in the diversity of teams across the Group. Gender equality is one of the key aspects of diversity due to the similar number of male and female employees (women accounted for 51.7% of employees in the entire Group as at 31 December 2017 and men accounted for 48.3%). The gender structure in the administrative bodies confirms that this objective has been achieved.

The Issuer has no retirement or similar benefit obligations with respect to former members of management, supervisory or administrative bodies.
16. SOCIAL AND SPONSORING ACTIVITIES POLICY
The social and sponsoring activities policy at Agora Group was adopted by the Management Board in 2016 to reflect the strategic approach to corporate social responsibility. In 2017, the Company continued its longterm activities within the following pillars: social, educational, cultural and charity, while launching new projects. These included national and regional initiatives implemented by Agora S. A. (including "Gazeta Wyborcza" and its

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 96

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
branches from all over Poland, Gazeta.pl portal and its services, Agora's Publishing House), as well as by Radio TOK FM and Agora's radio stations, Helios cinema network, AMS outdoor advertising company and Agora Foundation.
As part of its social activities, Agora implements long-term campaigns for the benefit of seniors, civil society and sustainable urban development, and is involved in environmental issues. The DlugoWIECZNI campaign once again addressed the subject of older people, among others thanks to a special supplement available with the "Gazeta Wyborcza" daily - Koperta ycia (Life Envelope), and in connection with the celebration of the Seniors' Week in Pozna. From a civic point of view, important discussions were held with important personalities making up a series of Wyborcza na ywo (Wyborcza Live) meetings taking place all over Poland. Last year, nearly 7,000 people participated in almost 80 local meetings held as part of this project. Radio TOK FM prepares regular debates on important social issues ­ in 2017, the Uslysz... (Hear...) formula focused on the reform of education. In addition, for the 7th time Radio TOK FM has awarded its Anna Laszuk Award for a character, organization or institution that has an exceptional influence on reality. In 2017, initiatives for the development of cities and their communities, carried out for a number of years, were focused on the nationwide Pracownia miast campaign and regional events: Miasta Idei na lsku and lskiego bez smogu! The latter campaign was additionally connected with the social campaign Oddycha po ludzku (Decent breathing). In the environmental area, it is worth mentioning the activities of the Gazeta.pl portal, which has been involved in the Greenpeace's Adoptuj pszczol (Adopt a Bee) campaign for the third time. Additionally, in 2017 Agora initiated new social projects addressed to various groups of stakeholders. The Wroclaw division of "Gazeta Wyborcza" published a free newspaper for the Ukrainians "Pryvit", and the video team of Gazeta.pl prepared socially engaged films: "Kiedy zobaczylem Ci po raz pierwszy" - related to Father's Day and "Powstacy 1944" ­ commemorating the participants of the Warsaw Uprising, as well as talks with entrepreneurs on social issues as part of the Next.Gazeta.pl series entitled "Next Time". The Agora's Publishing House and the Information Society Development Foundation, together with libraries, promoted reading as part of the "Paczka literacka" campaign. On the other hand, the innovative "Jutronauci" project created by "Gazeta Wyborcza" supported the promotion of innovative attitudes in many dimensions. In articles, videos, meetings and conferences, visionaries and researchers talked about their inventions, ideas and plans. In addition, 207 projects were submitted to the scholarship program "Bilet za horyzont" by future participants of the "Jutronauci" initiative. NewsMavens.com, the first European website created exclusively by women, has initiated an important discussion on the diversity of newsrooms and media coverage from the smaller EU countries. The pioneering project received funding from Google DNI and has already involved 21 female journalists from 13 editorial offices.
Education is a key topic of Agora's corporate social responsibility, and initiatives implemented by Agora include projects addressed to schools, teachers, parents and students. Support for educational institutions in the difficult process of change was the goal of the 16th edition of the Szkola z Klas 2.0 campaign. 95 schools and 642 teachers and other school staff applied to the project implemented by the Szkola z Klas Foundation, Civic Education Center and "Gazeta Wyborcza" with the support of the Polish-American Freedom Foundation and the Agora Foundation. A similar educational project was the Matematyka si liczy (Mathematics counts) campaign carried out by "Gazeta Wyborcza" in cooperation with the mBank Foundation. Apart from the competition for schools, there was also an educational conference, workshops and fairs, as well as special information materials and the Wyborcza.pl/matematyka website. The Helios cinema network is also developing its educational initiatives. Kino na temat and Kino na temat Junior are series of film meetings, during which young viewers have the opportunity to discuss important topics preceded by a screening of an interesting movie. Apart from taking part in the screening, the youngest children can participate in general development activities and games. In 2017, more than 2.5 thousand screenings were held throughout Poland.
The Agora Group's media are also involved in activities related to the promotion and popularisation of culture. Examples of such long-standing projects include literary awards (NIKE Award, Ryszard Kapuciski Award), Warsaw festivals and events (Co Jest Grane Festival, European Music Fair Co jest Grane 24) and Olsztyn Green Festival. Cultural prizes awarded in many local editorial offices of "Gazeta Wyborcza" are also important, such as Wdechy in Warsaw, WARTO Award in Wroclaw, and the Cegla z Gazety ­ Janoscha Award in Katowice. The NIKE Award for the Book of the Year has been awarded since 1998. This award and the NIKE Foundation's activities are funded by Agora and the Agora Foundation. Ryszard Kapuciski Award, organized since 2010 by "Gazeta Wyborcza" and the City of Warsaw, is a distinction granted to authors of the best reporter's book of the year and the best translation of the year. Additional activities related to this award are educational initiatives promoting the works of Ryszard Kapuciski among pupils of Warsaw schools. For 14 years now, the "Gazeta Wyborcza" weekly magazine "Co Jest Grane 24" has been organizing the Warsaw cultural awards "Wdechy". Warsaw also hosts two major cultural and musical events: Co Jest Grane Festival in the summer and European Music Fair Co Jest Grane 24 in the autumn. Olsztyn hosts the Olsztyn Green Festival. The Agora Group's activities
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 97

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2017 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
also include promotion of Polish cinema. Kultura Dostpna w Kinach (Culture Available in Cinemas) is part of a multi-annual program organized by the National Cultural Centre and the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage throughout the country. Owing to the series, a wide audience can get acquainted with Polish film art. In 2017, nearly 2.2 thousand screenings of almost 50 Polish films were held in the Helios cinema network as part of the series. For 18 years now, AMS has been inviting young graphic designers to create posters focusing on social issues. The AMS Poster Gallery is probably the largest competition of this type in Poland. In 2017, the participants submitted nearly 500 projects on the subject "Rzeczpospolita = Rzecz wspólna". The winning works can be viewed for a year on AMS citylights all over Poland. New cultural initiatives of AMS included activities related to the promotion of Polish literature, which is why special thematic bus stops: "Przystanek: Literatura" and "Przystanek: Wyspiaski" were created. In 2017, "Gazeta Wyborcza" also initiated regular meetings with artists who are talked about and the works that are to be experienced. About 3 thousand people took part in 6 meetings under the slogan Centrum Premier Czerska 8/10, while several thousand people watched the broadcasts at Wyborcza.pl and social media. The list of guest included, among others: Agnieszka Holland, Olga Tokarczuk, Elbieta Dzikowska, Martyna Wojciechowska, Marek Kamiski, Aleksander Doba, Krystyna Janda, creators of the movie "Loving Vincent", and Dan Brown. 2017 saw the first edition of the Akademia Opowieci (Academy of Stories) project, whose aim was to encourage the readers of "Gazeta Wyborcza" to describe the most important character in their lives. The initiative of reporters associated with "Duy Format" and the "Brama Grodzka ­ Teatr NN" Centre included meetings and workshops held in 12 Polish cities. They were accompanied by articles and materials published in "Duy Format" and on Wyborcza.pl/akademiaopowiesci, as well as a competition and a conference summarising the results. In the contest entitled "The most important person in my life", the readers sent 1655 stories about people who were important, but not widely known.
The last of the pillars of Agora's social activities are charitable initiatives, in which the Company's employees are also involved. Examples include the long-term involvement of "Gazeta Wyborcza" in charity campaigns on Children's Day, as well as activities undertaken as part of Fabryka witego Mikolaja in Wroclaw and Krzeslo dla ISKIERKI initiative in Katowice. In addition, as a part of creating equal opportunities, the Agora Foundation and the Academy for the Development of Philanthropy have been running Agrafka Agory program for many years. Employees, readers, listeners, viewers and customers of the Agora Group engage in auctions and fundraising for the benefit of Wielka Orkiestra witecznej Pomocy, WOP (The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity). In 2017, a total of over PLN 22 thousand was collected and "Gazeta Wyborcza" was the media patron of the 25th Final of WOP. The local editorial offices of the daily newspaper and the Helios cinemas helped raising money for the initiative and hosted local WOP headquarters. Auctions were organized by Radio TOK FM, Gazeta.pl portal, Radio Zlote Przeboje and Helios cinema network. In 2017, Agora Group radio stations also became involved in a special charity campaign "Odbudowujemy wie Wysoka Zaborska" (We are rebuilding the village of Wysoka Zaborska), aimed at helping those who suffered in the August storm. In total, PLN 282 thousand was collected for the benefit of affected families, and PLN 15 thousand was transferred to the account of the Brusy Commune from the sale of a special advertising block. The Agora Radio Group also funded a housing container for one of the most affected families.
Employees' involvement in various pro bono activities is an illustration of the Company's priority approach to social issues. As part of the "Finished ­ Let's swap" campaign, the books donated by the employees are distributed among others to the single mother's homes and hospitals. In 2017 Agora's employees took part in an unpaid blood donation campaign in which 5 litres of blood were collected. They also participated in the "Recycling of kindness" poll, in which they chose an organization to which the Company transferred funds from the sale of the paper archive of "Gazeta Wyborcza".
The initiatives and projects implemented in the area of social involvement fully reflect the objectives set out in the Social and sponsoring activities policy at Agora Group: education, individual and social development, shaping civic attitudes and caring for human rights, promotion of culture and universal access to it, promotion of health and healthy lifestyle, care for the natural environment and other aspects of charity and support activities.
In Agora's opinion, the implementation of the Social and sponsoring activities policy is consistent with the interests of the Company and its stakeholders, including shareholders, as it creates goodwill, contributes to social development and reflects the Company's responsibility for its impact on the environment.

(g) Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 8 March 2018.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union. Information about standards and interpretations, which were published and become effective after the balance sheet date, including those awaiting endorsement by the European Union, is presented in point (ae).
(b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures. All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its Group would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the Company or the Group from continuing their business operations. The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2016, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2017 the following amendments to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effective: 1) Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows - Disclosure initiative; 2) Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses.
The application of the amendments to IAS 7 resulted in additional disclosures for the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities as presented in note 34 p.5.

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities, which are controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group due to its involvement in an investee is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group has power over an investee when the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, ie the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.
The acquitision method of accounting is applied to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control commences until the date that control ceases to exist. Contingent consideration is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the value of the contingent payment liability is recognised through the income statement Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
(ii) Joint ventures and associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and other shareholders on the basis of a statute, company's act or other agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases to exist. The investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. An interest in a joint venture or associate is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture or associate. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the joint venture.
(iv) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equal to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point w).
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is usually as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 97 years 3 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 3 - 8 years 2 - 20 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, except for some special projects related to distribution and co-operation rights for movies and computer games, in case of which the consumption of economic benefits may significantly differ from the straight line approach and the pattern of consumption of economic benefits in particular periods can be reliably determined based on generated revenue and it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets (apart from acquired magazine titles) are usually between 2 and 20 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Internally generated intangible assets comprise expenditure related to developing computer software and internet applications, including costs of employee benefits, which can be directly allocated to the development phase of an internal project. During the development phase and after its completion the internally generated intangible assets are assessed whether there are indications of impairment according to the accounting policy described in point w.

(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash in transit and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised. At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses, whether there is objective evidence of impairment of financial assets. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset`s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted with the effective interest rate. Changes in impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.

(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses. Inventories comprise goods for resale, materials, finished goods and work in progress, including production cost of own movies. Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i) Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii) Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii) Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv) Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses, including reserve capital accumulated from prior years profits. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 in relation to the share incentive plans based on Agora S.A.'s shares, which ended in the first half of 2013, the initial recognition of put options granted to the non-controlling shareholders and actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans recognised in accordance with the policy described in point (r).
(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations. Deferred income tax is provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for: (i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and
at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method. Changes in the value of the liability are recognized in profit or loss, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants related to property, plant and equipment or intangible assets
Grants received for the financing of acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets are recognized, when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto. The grants are initially recognised at fair value as deferred income and credited to the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.

(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.

(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).
(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over its useful life, but no longer than the lease term. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets as described in point (d). Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The

finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.
(z) Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
Within the Agora Group there are incentive plans carried out, which are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments. In the Incentive Plan for Management Board members of the Company described in note 27 one of the components (based on share price appreciation) is accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment. In this plan, members of the Management Board of the Company are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The value of the provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the Plan with a corresponding figure recognised within accruals. The changes in the value of this accrual are included in staff costs.

More over, starting from the third quarter 2017, the eligible employees of a subsidiary Yieldbird Sp. z o.o. participate in an equity-settled incentive program. On the basis of the plan, the eligible employees are entitled to receive shares in the company The fair value of shares was determined at the grant date and is recognised in staff costs over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in Group equity allocated to non-controlling interests.

(ab) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac) Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the parent and group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.

(ad) Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operated in a Special Economic Zone till 8 August 2016. Income from activities in SEZ was exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption was recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption were treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
The Standard provides a framework that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in IFRS. Under the new standard, entities will apply a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue, and at what amount. The model specifies that revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognized over time, in a manner that depicts the entity's performance or at a point in time, when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Standard includes new qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements to enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The Group conducted the processs of assessing the impact that the application of the main provisions of the new standard may have on the consolidated financial statements, in particular in relation to multiple-element arrangements, licence agreements, customer bonuses and services provided with the engagement of subcontractors. On the basis of the analysis, the Group assesses that the initial application of the standard will have no material impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognised in the financial statements. At the same time, the Group assesses, that the new standard will influence the presentation of selected balance sheet line items and will increase disclosures in financial statements as required by the standard. In case of balance sheet, there will be a change in presentation of returns provision, which will be reclassified from the line item "Accounts receivable and prepayments" to the line item ,,Trade and other payables". In the current accounting policy the returns provision (at the amount of PLN 9,795 thousand as at 31 December 2017) decreases the carrying value of trade receivables. The above change will increase the balance sheet total. Additionally, the Group plans to reclassify the accruals balance from the line item ,,Deferred revenues and accruals" to the line item ,,Trade and other payables". After implementation of the standard the current line item ,,Deferred revenues and accruals" will comprise only deferred revenue resulting from contracts with customers. The above change will impact only the presentation of line items within liabilities and will not impact the balance sheet total. The approximate range of this change results from the amounts disclosed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
2) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later).
The new standard replaces the guidance included in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a model for calculating impairment losses. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of three categories:
- financial assets measured at amortized cost;
- financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or
- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).
The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. In respect of the financial assets impairment requirements, IFRS 9 replaces the "incurred loss" impairment model in IAS 39 with an "expected credit loss" model. Under the new approach, it will no longer be necessary for a loss event to occur before an impairment allowance is recognized.
In case of IFRS 9, the Group assesses that the application of the new guidance will have no material impact on the methods of measurement of financial instruments. In particular, the Group does not expect any changes in

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

classification of financial assets, which would result in a change in their measurement. In respect of credit risk assessment, the Group performed an analysis of its current methodology for calculating impairment losses of receivables, which takes into account a specific loss component and a collective loss component determined on the basis of historical payment statistics, and concludes that the initial application of the standard will have no material impact on the value of receivables.
3) IFRS 16 Leasing (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. The Standard eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees and instead requires companies to bring most leases on-balance sheet under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Bringing operating leases in balance sheet will result in recognizing a new asset ­ the right to use the underlying asset ­ and a new liability ­ the obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be depreciated and the liability accrues interest. Lessor accounting shall remain largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases will be retained.
The Group has started the processs of assessing the impact that the application of the new standard may have on the consolidated financial statements. On the basis of the initial analysis, the Group assesses that a part of the operating lease contracts (including in particular the lease of office space, locations for outdoor advertising panels and Helios cinemas) may be classified as lease contracts under IFRS 16. As a result, the initial application of the standard starting on 1 January 2019, may result in increasing assets and liabilities in the balance sheet while decreasing the costs of depreciation and interest expense at the same time. However, it should be noted that the current operating lease costs are recognised on a straight line basis according to IAS 17, while the implementation of IFRS 16 will result in assets costs being recognised on a straight line basis through depreciation charges and interest costs being recognised by using the effective interest method, which will cause higher total contract costs at the beginning of the contract and diminishing charges over the contract period. In 2018 the analysis of the impact of IFRS 16 will be continued, in particular, by considering the contracts linked to future minimum operating lease payments disclosed in note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.
4) Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance contracts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later) The amendments provide for the scope of applying IFRS 4 after IFRS 9 becomes effective.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
5) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements 2014-2016 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later, except for the changes to IFRS 12 that shall be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017) Annual changes to IFRS that contain amendments to 3 standards (IFRS 1, IFRS 12 and IAS 28).
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later, however, the European Commission decided to defer the endorsement indefinitely)
The amendments remove the acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is contributed to an associate or a joint venture concerning the recognition of profit or loss on the loss of control of subsidiary and require a full gain or loss to be recognised when the assets transferred meet the definition of a business under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

2) Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
The amendments, claryfing how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions, provide requirements on the accounting for: · the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments; · share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations; and · a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3) IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
IFRIC 22 provides requirements about which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance and clarifies that the transaction date is the date on which the company initially recognises the prepayment or deferred income arising from the advance consideration. For transactions involving multiple payments or receipts, each payment or receipt gives rise to a separate transaction date.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group already applies accounting policy consistent with these requirements.

4) Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later) The amendments provide clarification on transfers to, or from, investment properties. A transfer into, or out of investment property should be made only when there has been a change in use of the property and such a change in use would involve an assessment of whether the property qualifies as an investment property.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
5) IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 or later) IFRS 17, which supersedes the interim standard, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within its scope.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

6) IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities. If it is probable that the tax authorities will accept the uncertain tax treatment, then the tax amounts recorded in the financial statements are consistent with the tax return with no uncertainty reflected in measuring current and deferred taxes. Otherwise, the taxable income (or tax loss), tax bases and unused tax losses shall be determined in a way that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, using either the single most likely amount or expected value method (sum of probability weighted amounts). When assessing the probability of acceptance, an entity shall assume the tax authority will examine the position and will have full knowledge of all the relevant information.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have impact on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 22

The amendments allow companies to measure prepayable financial assets, with contractual terms that result in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding with socalled negative compensation, at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, instead of at fair value through profit or loss, if they meet other relevant requirements of IFRS 9.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have impact on the consolidated financial statements.
8) Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
The amendments clarify that companies account for investments in associates or joint ventures, for which equity method is not applied, in accordance with provisions of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have impact on the consolidated financial statements.

9) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements 2015-2017 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
Annual changes to IFRS that contain amendments to 4 standards (IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23). The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have impact on the consolidated financial statements.
10) Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
The amendments require that an entity uses current and updated assumptions when a change to a plan, its amendment, curtailment or settlement, takes place to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after the change to the plan. The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have impact on the consolidated financial statements.

c) Property, plant and equipment held for sale as at the balance sheet date

As at 31 December 2017, non-current assets with the carrying amount of PLN 13,747 thousand (as at December 31, 2016: PLN 10,682 thousand) were presented as held for sale and comprised perpetual usufruct rights to a plot of land located at the Czerniakowska Street in Warsaw and properties located in Gdansk at the Tkacka 7/8 and Welniarska 19/20 streets. In the segment information provided in note 21 those assets are presented within reconciling positions.
The actions to sell the assets have already been initiated by the Group. The Management Board expects the sales to be completed within the period shorter than 12 months from the balance sheet date and estimates that the fair value less costs to sell of those assets is higher than their carrying amount.
In the current report of December 7, 2017, the Management Board of Agora S.A. informed, further to current reports no. 33/2016 and 25/2017, that by virtue of an Amendment to the Conditional Agreement of December 7, 2017, the sale of the right of perpetual usufruct of the undeveloped plot of land with a total surface area of 6,270 square meters at ul. Czerniakowska 85/87 ("Property") would take place by the end of February 2018 and not by the end of 2017, as

previously informed. The Amendment concluded on December 7, 2017 to the Conditional Agreement concluded on October 27, 2017 did not affect the nature of the Conditional Agreement which remained a sale agreement with binding effects, concluded under the condition that the Mayor of the capital city of Warsaw does not exercise the right of first refusal to the right of perpetual usufruct of the Property ("Condition"). On February 26, 2017, since the condition for sales of the right of perpetual usufruct was fulfilled, the Company signed an agreement transferring the right of perpetual usufruct of the property. The total amount of the transaction is net PLN 19.0 million, and it shall positively impact the operating result of Agora Group by PLN 8.3 million in 1Q2018.

In the current report of January 22, 2018 The Management Board of Agora S.A. informed that the Company signed a conditional sale agreement of the usufruct right of two land properties located in Gdansk, including the ownership of the building set on the land properties. Detailed information are included in note 42.

d) Sale of property in Lodz
On October 27, 2016 Agora S.A. has entered into a conditional agreement with the sale of the right of perpetual usufruct of two properties of total area of ca. 4.2 thousand square meters located in Lodz, together with the ownership of the buildings erected on one of them, including a historic office building with covered area of ca. 1 thousand square meters (referred to collectively as "the Property"). The agreement was concluded under the condition that the Mayor of Lodz shall not exercise the right of first refusal to the Property vested in the Municipality of the City of Lodz.
The decision to sell the Property stems from the fact that the Company does not utilize effectively the entire Property for its operations. The Company believes that the optimal solution shall be to lease office space adapted to the current scale of operations of the Company in Lodz. Along with the conditional sale agreement, a conditional agreement was settled to lease office space, under which Agora will lease from the buyer office space located in the Property for the period of 5 years.
On December 2, 2016 the Company obtained information that the Mayor of Lodz will not exercise the pre-emotive right to the Property vested in the Municipality of the City of Lodz and consequently, on December 8, 2016 the agreement concerning transfer of the rights to the Property was executed.
The net selling price of the Property amounted to PLN 9,700 thousand and its impact on the other operating income of the Group gains in 2016 on disposal of non-financial non-current assets amounted to PLN 5,991 thousand.

Share Buyback Program in Agora S.A.
On June 21, 2017, the General Meeting of Shareholders adopted the resolutions concerning the authorisation of the Management Board of the Company to acquire Company's own shares for the purposes of their subsequent redemption and general terms of this process as well as the formation of a special-purpose reserve capital allocated for the acquisition of own shares for their redemption in the amount of PLN 23,833 thousand.
The offers to sell shares were accepted from the Company's shareholders from 2 October 2017 till 6 October 2017. All the transactions were settled on 10 October 2017. The Company had bought 1,084,595 of its own shares in total, thereby completing the Share Buyback Program. All the purchased shares were bearer shares listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with a par value of PLN 1.0 each, and (as at 10 October 2017) corresponded to 2.28 percent of the Company's share capital and 1,084,595 votes at the General Meeting of the Company in total, i.e. 1.67 percent of the total votes at the General Meeting of the Company (the "Purchased Shares"). The purchase price was PLN 20.0 per Purchased Share and PLN 21,692 thousand for all the Purchased Shares. The total purchase price (including transaction costs) amounted to PLN 21,744 thousand.
The Purchased Shares were acquired off the regulated market, via Millenium Dom Maklerski S.A., in settlement of the offer to buy shares of Agora S.A. announced by the Company on 26 September 2017. The number of bearer shares offered by shareholders for sale under the Offer totalled 29,131,971. Shareholders did not offer any registered shares for sale. Since the total number of bearer shares offered by shareholders for sale under the Share Buyback Program exceeded the total number of shares which the Company had intended to buy under the Offer (i.e. 1,084,595 shares), the number of shares purchased from individual shareholders was calculated in accordance with the share offer reduction rules detailed in point 10 of the Offer. The average reduction rate applied to the pool of the bearer shares was 96.3 percent.
Before the purchase of the Purchased Shares under the Share Buyback Program, the Company did not have any own (treasury) shares. Now, the Company holds only the Purchased Shares.
In accordance with the applicable laws, the Company does not exercise shareholders' rights attached to its own shares. The Company plans to redempt the purchased shares at the next general meeting of shareholders.

21. REVENUE AND OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
(a) Operating segment information
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, in these consolidated financial statements information on operating segments are presented on the basis of components of the Group that management monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Operating segments are components of the Group, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in the process of decision making regarding allocation of resources and assessing the performance of the Group.
For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services.
The Group activities are divided into six reportable operating segments as follows:
1) the Movies and Books segment includes the Group's activities within the cinema management of Helios S.A., film distribution and production activities of Next Film Sp. z o.o. and Next Script Sp. z o.o. as well as the activities of Agora`s Special Projects Department (including Agora`s Publishing House and film production until 31 March 2017),
2) the Press segment includes the Group's activities related to publishing of the daily Gazeta Wyborcza (until midOctober 2016 the free daily Metrocafe.pl was also published), special editions of Gazeta Wyborcza magazinesas well as publishing of the magazines within Agora's Magazine Department,
3) the Outdoor segment includes the activities within the AMS Group, which provides advertising services on different forms of outdoor advertising panels,
4) the Internet segment includes the following Group's activities: the Internet and multi-media products and services within the Agora's Internet department, Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o., Yieldbird Sp. z o.o., Sir Local Sp. z o.o. (until 31 March 2017), GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. and Optimizers Sp. z o.o.;
5) the Radio segment includes the Group's activities within local radio stations, super-regional TOK FM radio and Agora's Radio Department,
6) the Print segment includes the Group's activities related to printing services within the Agora's Printing Department and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.
Accounting policies for operating segments are the same as followed by the Agora Group, besides some issues described below.
Data within each reportable segment are consolidated pro-forma. The Management Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Press segment operating costs associated with the production of Gazeta Wyborcza are settled on the basis of the allocation of costs from the Print segment. Since the first quarter of 2017 the production costs are settled by allocation of printing services according to a card rate set on the market basis. In previous years the production costs were settled by allocation of direct and indirect costs (including D&A) related to its production. The presentation

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year period ended thereon

of data for the comparative periods was adjusted accordingly. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Operating results of reportable segments do not include: a) revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior
reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments, b) amortisation recognised on consolidation (described below).
Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income tax are managed on a Group level and are not allocated to operating segments. Transfer prices between operating segments are set on the market basis in the manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Reconciling positions show data not included in particular segments, inter alia: operating costs and the result on other operating activities of Agora's support divisions (centralized IT, administrative, HR functions, etc.), the Management Board and Agora TC Sp. z o.o. , intercompany eliminations and other matching adjustments, which reconcile the data presented in the management reports to the consolidated financials of the Agora Group. In case of equity accounted investees, the reconciling positions include the investment in Stopklatka S.A. and in Green Content Sp. z o.o. (until 31 August 2017).
Operating depreciation and amortisation includes amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets of each segment. Amortisation recognised on consolidation can be defined as consolidation adjustments, inter alia: the amortisation of intangible assets and adjustments to property, plant and equipment recognised directly on consolidation.
Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses show impairment losses and their reversals presented in other operating expenses and income.
Amount of investment in associates and joint ventures accounted for by the equity method include the amount of acquired shares adjusted by the Group`s share of net results of those entities accounted for by the equity method. The financials presented for the year 2017 and for the year 2016 relate to Online Technologies HR Sp. z o.o, Instytut Badan Outdooru Sp. z o.o., Stopklatka S.A., Hash.fm Sp. z o.o. and Green Content Sp. z o.o. (from 1 December 2016 until 31 August 2017).
Capital expenditure consists of additions based on the invoices booked in the reported period connected to purchases of intangible and fixed assets. In case of Movies and Books segment capital expenditure do not include outlays related to the cinema fit-out works to the extent in which those outlays are reimbursed by the owners of the premises, in which those cinemas are located.
The Agora Group does not present geographical reporting segments, because its business activities are carried out mainly in Poland.

27. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
a) Incentive Plan for years 2016-2017
Starting from the second quarter 2016, Management Board members of the Company participate in an incentive program ("Incentive Plan"), on the basis of which, they are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on two components described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The EBITDA target is specified as the EBITDA result (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation) to be reached in the given financial year determined by the Supervisory Board. The amount of potential bonus depends on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the given financial year;
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the Incentive Plan will depend on the percent of Company's share price increase in the future. The share price increase will be calculated as a difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the first quarter of the financial year commencing after the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IQ") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the fourth quarter of the financial year preceding the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IVQ"). If the Average Share Price IQ will be lower than the Average Share Price IVQ, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan will not be granted.
The bonus from the Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of a non-market condition, which is the continuation of holding the post of the Management Board member within the period, for which the bonus is calculated.
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for the Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are specified in the Supervisory Board resolution.
As at 31 December 2017, the value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target for 2017 and was charged to the Income Statement.
As at 31 December 2017, the value of the potential reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. That value was charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the vesting period of this component of the Incentive Plan.
The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase are described below:

b) Equity - settled incentive plan based on shares of a subsidiary
Starting from the third quarter 2017, the eligible employees of a subsidiary Yieldbird Sp. z o.o. participate in an equitysettled incentive program. On the basis of the plan, the eligible employees are entitled to receive shares in the company. The grant of shares is dependent on the fulfillment of a non-market condition, which is the continuation of employment within the agreed vesting period.
The rules, goals and conditions of the incentive plan were approved by the Agora S.A. Management Board resolution on 12 July 2017.
The fair value of the shares granted is recognised in staff costs over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of shares was determined at the grant date by applying a valuation model based on discounted cash flows of the company and by using a discount rate at the level of 9.8%. The model assumes that the eligible employees are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.

33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
credit risk,
liquidity risk,
market risk.
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Policy of Risk Management functions within the Group that determines the rules and the framework of risk management process as well as establishes the responsibilities of its participants.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, granted loans and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, a significant concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and for the year period ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 % of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
The ageing of overdue trade receivables as at balance sheet date is presented in note 9.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by diversification of its investments in investment funds, which invest in different classes of debt instruments. The Group does not acquire securities directly, but only through investment funds. At the same time, the Company invest only in liquid securities.
Collaterals
The maximum exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of financial instruments.
The information related to collaterals held is described in note 34.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2017, the Group maintains a credit facility in DNB Bank Polska S. A. described in note 14.
In addition, the Company has implemented a liquidity management system, which functions within the Group ("the Cash Pooling Agreement"). The agreement was signed on May 25, 2017 between DNB Bank Polska S.A. on the one side and Agora S.A. and selected subsidiaries companies from the group from the other side. The Cash Pooling Agreement aims to optimize cash liquidity and the most efficient management of cash for entities participating in the cash pooling system. Agora S.A. acts as a cash pool leader within the system. In accordance with this agreement, the Company may use the funds collected by other participants of the cash pooling system up to PLN 80,000 thousand. Intra-group balances and transactions related to cash pooling agreemet are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Payment deadlines concerning trade payables are described in note 20 and bank loans in note 14. Future estimated cash flows related to financial liabilities are described in note 34.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to sales of printing and advertising services to foreign customers, purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises, which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 2,199 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2016: PLN 1,653 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 7,087 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2016: PLN 6,263 thousand), principally in EURO,USD and GBP.

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,991 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2016: PLN 3,010 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to 6 months.
In 2017, Agora S.A. was not engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).

Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.

Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2017, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the impact of changes in fair value of financial instruments is estimated at the level of net loss/profit of PLN 527 thousand (as at December 31, 2016: PLN 525 thousand).
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables, payables). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2017, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to impact the net profit/loss in the amount of PLN 591 thousand (as at December 31, 2016: PLN 391 thousand).
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.

Key assumptions that are most significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include: estimated level of the operating result EBIT during the period specified in put option conditions and discount rate. In the fourth quarter of 2017 Agora S.A. and non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A. signed Annexes to the option agreements dated March 30, 2010 and October 29, 2010. According to the signed Annexes, the option formula, which constitutes the basis for estimating the future option exercise price, was amended by replacing the EBITDA multiple with the EBIT multiple. This amendment was included in the measurement of the put option liability at the balance sheet date.
In case of the put option granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., an increase of the estimated EBIT level over the period specified in put option conditions by 10%, would cause an increase of put option liability by ca PLN 3,280 thousand, while an increase of the discount rate by 1pp, would cause a decrease of the liability by ca PLN 1,450 thousand.

Scope of collateral
contract for construction and exploitation of MSI panels

The total amount of the contingencies, guarantees and other collaterals is smaller than 10% of the Group's equity.
Additionally, Helios S.A. issued blank promissory notes as collaterals for bank loan agreements and finance lease agreements and guarantees on rent agreements.
Moreover, AMS S.A. provided to the bank cash deposits as a cash collateral securing the bank guarantees issued in relation to the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw. In the third quarter of 2016 AMS S.A. fulfilled the conditions giving entitlement to the reduction of the cash deposits and the cash in the amount of PLN 8.0 million was returned to the company. Consequently, as at 31 December 2017 the deposit receivable amounts to PLN 21.6 million ( out of which PLN 10.8 million is presented within long-term receivables).
Information on contingent liabilities related to legal disputes is described in note 18.
Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to PLN 393 thousand in 2017 and PLN 673 thousand in 2016.

37. COMMITMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases (including the lease of outdoor locations for advertising panels, Helios cinemas, buildings and other) are summarised as follows:

Within one year Between one and five years More than five years Total

31 December 2017 86,764
221,461 204,989 513,214

31 December 2016 90,572
236,113 265,731 592,416

The amounts disclosed above include VAT that the Group will be able to recover. The value of net minimum lease payments denominated in EURO amounted to EUR 83,793 thousand (2016: EUR 91,345 thousand).
Annual payments of the Group related to the perpetual usefruct of land amount to PLN 1,320 thousand (2016: PLN 1,357 thousand).

40. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill, intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles) and non-current assets related to activities in Print segment as a result of the ongoing decrease in revenues from sales of printing services in the coldset technology in which Agora Group's printing plants specialize. In order to determine their recoverable amounts the value in use for the relevant cash generating units was determined on the basis of long-term cash flow projections.
The Group points out that the value of revenue included in the cash flow projections depends on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. Changes in factors such as GDP dynamics, unemployment rate, amounts of remuneration or level of consumption may influence the purchasing power of the Group`s customers and consumers of its services and goods. Polish economy is sensitive to the country political situation and a looping risk of abrupt legislative changes, whose full impact on the conditions of running business activity in Poland is hard to foresee. Moreover, advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged. The estimated recoverable amount of the assets is also affected by the discount rate and the applied growth rate after the period of detailed forecast in the so-called residual period.
The Group identified two key assumptions, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast in the residual period and
2) pre-tax discount rate.
Basic information about the method applied is summarized below:

Goodwill related to activities in Trader.com (Polska) Internet

Goodwill and rights related to activities in
particular magazine
titles

Goodwill related to
radio activities

Goodwill related to activities in outdoor segment

Goodwill related to activities in

* in case of financial projection related to printing activities a 10-year detailed forecast period was assumed and residual value of assets at the end of the forecast period was estimated.
According to the impairment tests carried out, the impairment losses were recognised in relation to goodwill of Trader.com (Polska) in the amount of PLN 21,285 thousand, in relation to press title "Cztery Katy" in the amount of PLN 13,192 thousand (including the amounf of PLN 2,198 thousand related to goodwill of purchased magazines titles) and in relation to the non-current assets assigned to Print segment in the amount of PLN 36,145 thousand (the amount including: PLN 51,529 thousand related to property, plant and equipment and the remaining amount of PLN 51 thousand related to intangible assets). Disadvantageous change of key assumptions would result in further impairment losses.
In 2016 there were no impairment losses connected with the investments mentioned in the table above.
To key estimates and assumptions, that may cause a significant adjustment to the amounts recognised in financial statements of the Group, belongs also the recognition of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses. Information on those estimates and judgments was described in note 15.

On February 20, 2018, the Company signed an annex to above-mentioned preliminary sale agreement. By virtue of the signed annex, the deadline for conclusion of the final Sales Agreement was changed. Originally, the signing of the Agreement was scheduled until February 20th, 2018. The new deadline for concluding the new contract was scheduled until February 27th, 2018.
On February 27, 2018, the Company signed an agreement for sale of the above-mentioned property. The decision to sell the property stems from the fact that the Company does not utilize effectively the entire property for its operations. The Company believes that the optimal solution shall be to lease office space adapted to the current scale of operations of the Company in Gdansk.The total sale price of the Property amounted to PLN 8.65 million net, and its impact on the operating result of the Agora Group in 1Q2018 shall amount to ca PLN 5.6 million.
Moreover, on February 26, 2018, since the condition for sales of the right of perpetual usufruct was fulfilled, the Company signed an agreement transferring the right of perpetual usufruct of undeveloped property with the total area of 6,270 square meters in 85/87 Czerniakowska Street in Warsaw. The total amount of the transaction is net PLN 19.0 million, and it shall positively impact the operating result of Agora Group by PLN 8.3 million in 1Q2018.
Group layoffs in Print segment
On February 7, 2018 The Management Board of Agora S.A informed about:
(i) concluding on February 7th, 2018 a trilateral agreement ("Agreement") with trade unions operating at the Company (which fulfills the provisions of article 3, Section 1 of the Act of March 13th, 2003 on Special Rules for Termination of Employment for Reasons Not Attributable to Employees) and with work council in the Company (which constitutes an agreement in accordance with the Act of April 7th, 2006 on informing and consulting employees),
(ii) adopting by the Management Board of the Company on February 7th, 2018 resolution to execute collective redundancies in the Print segment of the Agora Group, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.
The collective redundancies shall be executed from February 15th, 2018 until March 16th, 2018, and shall affect up to 53 employees of the Print segment of the Agora Group, i.e. ca 16.3% of all employees of the segment.
In accordance with the agreement, the laid-off employees will be provided by the Company with a wider range of supportive measures than required by law. The redundancy payment estimated according to law regulations shall be increased by indemnity in the amount equal to one additional monthly salary. The laid-off employees shall be supported by additional protective measures provided by the Company, inter alia, help in searching for new job or reskilling. Employees who will remain employed in the Print segment will have their basic remuneration increased, inter alia, due to the changed scope of duties. The Company, in accordance with requirements of law, shall submit an appropriate set of information, together with the signed Agreement, to a relevant Labor Office.
The estimated amount of provision for collective redundancies which will be charged to the Agora Group's result in 1Q2018, shall amount to approximately PLN 1.6 million. The Agora Group estimates that the restructuring measures my result in the annual savings may amount to approximately PLN 2.0 ­ PLN 2.5 million.
The final amounts will be provided in the finacial report for the first quarter of 2018.
The reason for the planned restructuring measures, including restrictions on employment, is the ongoing decrease of revenues from sales of print services in the coldset technology in which Agora Group's printing plants specialize. This trend mainly results from the condition of the press market in Poland - the main client of the Company's coldset

printing plants. Services commissioned by clients from other market segments, including those realized in the heatset technology, present a significantly smaller share in the Group's print activity; due to infrastructural constraints, they never were, nor are able to compensate the decrease of revenues from coldset printing services.
Considering the current condition of the press market as well as negative forecasts regarding the prospects for its further development and progressive digitization of the media, it is not possible to stop the downward trend in the coldset printing business. Therefore, the Management Board of the Company decided that it is necessary to take decisive restructuring measures aimed at reducing operating costs of the printing plants and optimizing the operational processes so as to limit the negative impact of decrease of the number of volumes of print on the financial condition of the Print segment, i.a. by adjusting the employment structure to the current volume of services provided by Agora's printing plants.

The Company estimates that the establishment of the tax capital group may result in lower tax charges of tax group, as provided for by law, by approximately PLN 5.0 million annually in the period of tax group's operation.
Gastronomic activity in a subsidiary
