REVIEW BY THE PRESIDENT AND CEO

A YEAR OF CHANGE
Raute is a leading technology and service supplier in theveneerbasedwood products sector. The year 2019 brought big changes both to our customers as well as to us as a company.

In 2019, uncertainty in the global economy and in our customers' markets increased. Many of our traditional customers were still digesting major investments made in the past few years. As a result, our demand focused on major new capacity projects, minor improvements, as well as services. Mid-sized projects accounted for a low share of demand, which made it more difficult to forecast order intake and caused larger variations in our order intake volumes.
We started the year with a strong order book and high hopes to continue the strong development we had enjoyed for the past several years. The market change and unexpected challenges with some deliveries, caused by the previous year's record-high work load, made us fall short of our expectation and targets in terms of revenue and profits. However, we can be satisfied with the strong development of our spare parts and technology services business and new orders from the emerging markets in Asia and South America.
Changing customer profiles Our markets are changing. In the future, plywood and LVL industries are expected to have modest growth in the developed markets. At the same time, the emerging economies are forecasted to continue strong demand growth. The results of this were seen already in 2019, when a number of new, smaller companies entered the wood products industry, especially

in the growing markets. These companies have a different way of operating. Their priorities in terms of investments' size, technology, quality and scope of services differ from the more traditional players. In order to meet the requirements of these new customers, we have to constantly develop our product and service offering and the way we do business.
Renewing management structure Meeting our new customers' requirements was one the reasons why we renewed our management structure in 2019. The new structure strengthens the implementation of our strategy, supports us in achieving our growth targets and helps us in meeting the different customer needs. After the renewal, our business is divided into four areas based on different customer needs: Power market, Growth market, Basic services and Metrix.
Our goal is to become the preferred supplier for a growing number of customers in the emerging markets, and maintain our strong position in the developed markets. I believe this new operating model will help us reach this goal.
Successful execution of strategy One of our biggest successes in 2019 was the booking of a contract withthe Russian SegezhaGroup for the entire set of production machinery for their plywood mill in the making.The value of the order wassome

EUR58 million, making it thebiggest single order inRaute'shistory. In the emerging markets, we received orders from new customers in Asia and South America.
In 2019, the demand for our maintenance services remained at a good level and in spare parts we had a record-breaking year, which is an indication of the good capacity utilization rates of our customers' production plants.
The year 2019 also marks a year when we saw the tangible benefits of our acquisition of the US-based Metriguard Inc., the world leader in high-speed strength grading technology for lumber and veneer. In 2019, the company's products and services were fully integrated into Raute's offering. This resulted in several important product and service launches at the Ligna fair in Hannover in May, as well as the first orders and deliveries of such integrated systems.
Embracing the opportunities of digitalization Raute is the leading technologysupplierin the wood products sector, and digital solutions play a crucial role inourstrategy. Our offering includes for example digital solutions such as computer vision and other analyzers, as well as systems that enable remote monitoring and control in order to add value to our customers' processes and to enable them to thrive. By digitalizing our own processes, we can increase the efficiency of our operations and improve quality.

machinery are recyclable and the carbon stored in wood products has positive climate impacts. Increasing the use of sustainably produced wood in construction, for example, is among the most important means of achieving global climate targets.
Continuously improving work safety is one of the keypoints inour corporate responsibility agenda.In 2019,Raute'sLTIF indicator(Lost TimeInjury Frequency,i.e. lost-time injuries per million hours worked)continued to decrease, reaching afigure of 13.6.
Well positioned for 2020 Year 2019 was a year of change for Raute. And the change will continue. Our challenge will be to reposition ourselves to the new market situation. In 2020, we want to finalize the implementation of the new management structure, maintain and strengthen our leading position in our traditionally strong markets as well as strengthen our standing in the emerging markets. I believe we are in a good position to do all this.
I would like to express my sincerest thanks for the past year to Raute's customers for their invaluable cooperation and trust, to our personnel for their good work and strong commitment, to our shareholders for their continued confidence in us, and to all our other partners for their contribution to furthering Raute's development and progress.

Responsibility is an integral part of everything we do We want to help our customerscreate value in forest assets through our resource-efficient technology and supporting services.Most of the products manufactured using our

Long-lasting wood products
Thanks to our new innovations and state-of-the-art technology, our customers in the wood products industry can boost their production and improve the end-product quality. Our customers manufacture long-lasting wood-based panel products: veneer, plywood and LVL.

Veneer is a thin wood panel manufactured by peeling or slicing from a log.

Plywood is a panel of wood consisting of thin, crossbonded veneers.

LVL(Laminated Veneer Lumber) is a beam made of veneers glued with their grains parallel and then hot pressed; it is used in loadbearing structures.

End uses
Veneer, plywood and LVL products are used mainly in construction and furniture-making as well as in transport vehicle and packaging industries. The use of different wooden structures and components is growing dramatically especially in construction.
Renewability, recyclability and eco-friendliness are sustainable trends that increase the demand for and use of wood products worldwide.

Circular economy
Circular economy tries to keep products in use for as long as possible and to reuse their materials efficiently while maintaining the raw materials' value.
Wood-based panel products are long-lasting wood products. After their original life is over, they can be reused, recycled or used as raw material in energy production. In the future, an increasing proportion of wood products will be recycled.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WOOD PROCESSING VALUE CHAIN

Attention is shifting from the carbon footprint to carbon handprint. In a carbon-neutral future, the winners will be clean technologies, products and solutions that enable customers and other parties in the value chain to reduce their emissions.
The popularity of wood as a raw material is growing and its use in construction is increasing.

Construction is also constantly subject to new speed and efficiency requirements. New solutions based on engineered wood products are arriving to the market.
Safety and resource-efficiency requirements for production processes are tightening.
New digital solutions based on automation are becoming more common, enabling new types of business models and services.

INCREASING UNCERTAINTY IN KEY CUSTOMERS' MARKETS
Raute has a significant position as a supplier of technology and services in its key markets in Europe, Russia, North America and parts of South America. We believe that our renewable technology offering and global service capacity will strengthen our position in our other target markets.

Demand for wood products is driven by the construction industry and the demand for investment goods. Project deliveries as well as modernizations are treated as investments by our customers, which makes our business very sensitive for economic fluctuations. The global economy is very unpredictable in the short term due to political and other crises.
In traditional markets, performance-driven thinking and lifecycle management of business operations gain importance. Demand for advanced services will increase in the future.
In emerging markets, the market characteristics and competitive landscape are quite different: low-cost products, new raw materials and low labor costs are typical for emerging markets. In these markets, there is also demand for a new type of "low cost ­ easy to use" solution offering.

Increasing uncertainty in 2019 In 2019, the situation in the global economy and the financial markets deteriorated steadily. The same applied to the economic outlook. Many of Raute's established and traditional customers have invested heavily during the past few years. As demand among this traditional customer base remained at a lower level than in the past few years, the demand for our technology continued to shift towards new and different types of customer accounts.
Demand for wood products technology and technology services remained at a reasonable level Although investment activity among Raute's customers has decreased from what it was in recent years, it remained at a reasonable level in 2019. Enquiry activity for new capacity projects and larger projects involving replacement and efficiency-investments

remained at a good level, and we also conducted several trade negotiations.
Demand was active especially in Russia, although forecasting the realization and timing of projects is difficult. In the emerging markets of Asia, China included, demand continued to pick up. Interest towards Raute's offering in these markets increased. This development did not result in a significant amount of new orders yet, but we estimate that there is strong potential for us in these markets in the future.
Demand for maintenance and spare parts services remained at a good level in 2019, which is an indication of the generally good capacity utilization rates of Raute's customers' production plants.

We offer safety solutions that improve well-being at work, occupational safety and productivity. The excellent ergonomics of our machines and state-of-the-art safety automation solutions guarantee smooth and safe working conditions.
We are active participants in a European working group developing the safety of machinery (Observing Committee (K114) of European Committee for Standardization CEN/TC 114- Safety of Machinery).
Growing together with the customer We are genuinely interested in our customers' needs and the bottlenecks and investment criteria of the veneer, plywood and LVL production processes. Many of our customers are relatively small private family companies. However, some of our customers are part of major consolidated forest groups that manufacture not only various wood-based panel products, but also products such as pulp, paper and sawn timber. Our goal is to become the preferred supplier for a growing number of customers, in more and more market areas.

EMBRACING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF DIGITALIZATION

Digital solutions play a crucial role in Raute's strategy. We continuously develop new digital solutions in order to add value to our customers. Our active research work and cooperation with other leading companies and universities are aimed at finding new technologies and solutions that will allow us to maintain our position as a leading technology supplier in the wood products sector.
With our digital solutions, we are able to process and analyze vast amounts of data collected from customers' equipment and processes. This data is collected through Raute's visual, moisture and density analyzers to provide an accurate picture of the whole production process. Based on this information, our customers can

improve the yield of their raw materials and the quality of their end products. Digital solutions also reduce response times as well as increase the transparency of the production process and the overall efficiency and performance of the customer's mill.
In the future, expanding our services from the optimization of individual processes to the optimization of several processes inside the customer's mill will offer us new possibilities to increase their efficiency and performance. With this increased insight on the state of the customer's equipment and processes, we can also offer new services such as predictive maintenance services and value-based maintenance agreements.

LEADING KNOW-HOW ON THE PLYWOOD PRODUCTION PROCESS

Segezha Group is a Russian forest industry holding company. The Group focuses on forestry operations as well as the manufacturing of wood, pulp and paper products. The Group has operations in eleven countries in Europe as well as in Russia, and its products are delivered to over 100 countries around the world.
In the past, Raute has cooperated with Segezha Group in 2006 and 2017 by delivering two production processes for Segezha's affiliate.
In 2019, Raute's relationship with the Segezha Group deepened further, when Raute signed an agreement to deliver all machinery and equipment for the production process of Segezha's greenfield

plywood mill in Galich, Kostroma region. This order, worth some EUR 58 million, is the biggest single order in Raute's history. The required equipment will be engineered and produced in Raute's units in Nastola, Kajaani and Shanghai, as well as by Raute's partnership network.
"When selecting the supplier, Raute's experience in resource-efficient technology, delivery capability and the company's local presence and service network in the Russian market tilted the scale to their favor," says Mr. Shamolin M.V., President at the Segezha Group. "The scope of the order also serves as proof of Raute's leading know-how on the plywood production process," Shamolin M.V. concludes.

Arauco is one of the largest forestry companies in the world. The company has over 30 production facilities in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, the United States and Canada, and it has over 5,000 customers in over 80 countries on five continents.
Arauco and Raute have a long joint history that dates back to early 1990s, when Raute carried out the first feasibility study of plywood and LVL for Arauco.
During the years, Raute and Arauco have successfully developed maintenance co-

operation, achieving high efficiency and equipment uptime at the plywood mills. Raute has also carried out several training programs, modernization projects and installed new production lines to Arauco's plywood mills.
"One of the reasons we wanted to work with Raute is that with them, we can be sure we have access to the newest technology available in the market. Because of this, we can continuously update our mills, which gives us a competitive advantage over our competitors," says José Miguel Marqués, Operations Manager at Arauco.

During the year, our personnel grew by 6 people and totalled 778 at the year end.

Raute has a constant need for skilled personnel working as automation engineers, maintenance service experts and digital service specialists.
A younger and more diverse Raute Over the last few years, many young people have joined our growing team. In 2019, our average age remained at the previous year's level and was 42.3 years. In five years, the number of employees under 30 has grown by 13 people and they made up 20 percent of our entire personnel in 2019. The share of women has also increased to 11 percent and they can be found more often in specialist and supervisory positions.Raute has also become more multicultural and currently there are 10 different nationalities working at our unit in Nastola.

Competence development and mentoring continues By continuously developing our competence, we can ensure that Raute's strategy is implemented successfully now and in the future. Through the RauteACADEMY learning system adopted in 2017, our personnel have had the chance to participate voluntarily in training involving different topics. In 2019, the focus of training was on occupational safety, company values, Code of Conduct and company strategy. In 2019, RauteACADEMY offered a total of 38 courses and altogether 714 courses were completed with passing grades. For the third time, we organized a global leadership training program with a focus on coaching leadership style, how to handle difficult situations and how to address poor performance.

In 2019, Raute continued its close collaboration with technology and business schools, as well as universities and polytechnics. The most common forms of collaboration have been internships, theses, projects and corporate visits. In 2019, 33 interns and 5 thesis workers worked at Raute in different production, planning and also customer service and management tasks.
Mentoring was also one of the key focus areas in Raute's HR strategy in 2019. In the course of the year, 15 persons participated in mentoring programs.

We at Raute are in a very good position to embrace the opportunities of digitalization.

FROM A YOUNG APPRENTICE TO A PRODUCTION WIZARD
My career in Raute began in August 2011 as I joined the company as a young trainee. In the following year, I returned to Raute to do my thesis, after which I worked in several different positions in different processes at Raute. In 2015, I became Manager of Production Planning and after a few years took lead of a team of highly experienced manufacturing engineers. During my three and a half years in that role, me and our team planned over 300 projects that consisted

of over 110 modernization types, over 170 production lines and 11 mill scale plans produced globally. In February 2019, I became Production Manager, responsible for the production of Raute's main plant and overseeing and organizing the whole production process with a team of skilled and experienced professionals.
I have always been hungry for new opportunities to challenge myself and to pursue my professional goals. In Raute, I have been able to do exactly that. I have also

been lucky in a sense that my superiors and colleagues have always been very supportive and coached and mentored me when I have needed their guidance. I have tried to take the same approach to my work. Nowadays, my biggest satisfaction at work is to coach and motivate colleagues and team members to help them succeed in their work.
I must also confess that I am a bit of a technology geek. I'm passionate about Industry 4.0 and the opportunities digitalization can

bring to our industry. We at Raute are in a very good position to embrace the opportunities of digitalization. I believe this will give Raute a competitive edge and make it an even more attractive workplace for talented and ambitious individuals in the future.

One of the perks of working at Raute is the possibility for multiple different career paths.

EXPERIENCE MEETS NEW TALENT This year marks my fifteenth year at Raute. During that time, I've worked as Chief Designer, Product Manager and now as an Engineering Manager. I ended up in Raute because of my love for mechanical engineering and building machines. During these years, Raute has offered me opportunities to develop myself and advance to managerial duties, which has widened my horizons and increased my curiosity towards more business and personnel-oriented tasks. In 2016, I decided to

do my master's in Business Administration, and I graduated in 2019. Raute made combining my studies and work possible, and they were very flexible. In my experience, Raute is a very adaptable and supportive employer, which is what we try to promote when attracting new talent.
The world is changing fast and we need new know-how and brainpower. As a part of that, we are collaborating with the Lahti University of Applied Sciences on a strategic and practical

level. We also engage with the students by giving talks at the university and organizing joint projects. The increased number of young talent at Raute has had a positive effect on our working environment.
In addition, many other changes have taken place over the years: digitalization has accelerated, the amount of data has increased and there is more emphasis on aftersales service, for example. For newcomers, Raute offers long-term employment and an

encouraging environment for development. One of the perks of working at Raute is the possibility for multiple different career paths.

I believe that working together is one of the best ways to get to know other cultures.

STRENGTH FROM VERSATILITY I began working in Raute in 2016, after I had finished my thesis on developing eLearning as an industrial service for Raute. I worked as a service coordinator in Training services until spring 2018, when I became the manager of Training Services. After some organizational changes, my focus area changed from training services to upgrades. My responsibilities also include Service Excellence, which aims to improve the customer experience regarding our service business. My work is very human-

oriented and getting along with people is very important. People often have a certain image of the industrial sector but in reality it is very varied. For example, our team consists of people with different backgrounds and competences.
The best part about my job is that I feel trusted ­ I can work from home if I need to focus on something, and I don't have to worry about someone watching over my shoulder. In my job I also get to work with teams and customers

all over the globe. This internationality was actually one of the reasons I got interested in Raute in the first place. I believe that working together is one of the best ways to get to know other cultures.
In Raute, and especially in our team, I really appreciate the active development-oriented and forward-looking mindset we have. Our team consists mostly of people who are relatively new at Raute ­ compared to our average career length ­ so we have a lot of

new ideas and suggestions for development. Proposals for improvement are always met with encouragement and there is a positive attitude towards change within the company, which I find very important.

RAUTE'S ECONOMIC IMPACT 2019
We deliver resource-efficient technology for the wood products industry, which uses renewable raw materials. Most of the products manufactured using our machinery are recyclable and have a long life, and the carbon stored in wood products has positive climate impacts. Increasing the use of sustainably produced wood in construction and manufacturing, for example, is one of the potential means to achieving global climate targets. Demand for clean technology will grow in the wood products industry with the increasing global focus on climate emissions from raw materials.

RAUTE'S BUSINESS AND SUSTAINABILITY

We promote sustainable forestry practices among our customers.

Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.

We help our customers to maximize the yield and value of their forest assets as raw material in a resource-efficient way.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Plywood and LVL are made of renewable, recyclable wood, replacing many materials with a harmful environmental impact.

The challenge in the value chain is to find a solution to replace current harmful glue types ­ this is an opportunity for Raute.

Raute's solutions enable high yield of raw materials and energy efficient processes.

ENVIRONMENT

Our carbon handprint is visible in the wood processing value chain. Our strong carbon handprint results from the better resource-efficiency of our technology solutions compared to our competitors.

Over the past 25 years, we have delivered mill-scale veneer, plywood and LVL projects corresponding to an annual capacity of more than 5 million cubic meters. This volume of wood-based panel products stores close to 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide captured by tree growth each year.
After the emissions resulting from the production chain, the annual carbon dioxide volume captured in the production of the mills we have delivered corresponds closely to the emissions from 800,000 passenger cars. Sustainable forestry and long-lasting wood products are key enablers of a low-carbon society. Our advanced technology solutions support this development throughout a production facility's life cycle, enabling the efficient use of raw materials, energy and other production inputs.
The continuous advancement of technology and rapid progress of digitalization are changing our operating methods and customer service

processes. Our goal is to proactively reduce the environmental impacts and risks of our activities in relation to our production operations.
Our environmental impacts in relation to hours worked fell further in 2019. Energy consumption per hours worked fell by 3 percent and the consumption of water per person fell by 10 percent. In Finland, the amount of waste remained at the previous year's level, but grew by 27 percent in relation to net sales. The carbon dioxide emissions of our operations decreased 104 tonnes from the previous year, but grew by 15 percent in relation to net sales.
Our Nastola unit's operations are certified according to the ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environment) standards. Our environmental management program targets apply to, for instance, improving energy efficiency, reducing the volume of waste and the management of chemical safety. In 2019, the execution rate for measures concerning managing environmental matters was 88 percent.

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY

A safe work environment and the right working methods both at our units and at our customers' mills are some of our key focus areas. Occupational safety was one of our main themes also in 2019, and we carried out a number of related measures at our units. These actions brought results as our LTIF figure improved significantly by 43 percent to 13.6, mainly driven by the good safety performance at our Nastola main production unit. In Finland we reached 223 days without an LTI accident by the end of year 2019.
We will continue to further improve our occupational safety culture through our "Safety first" theme. Our target for 2020 is to achieve a 10 on the LTIF scale, i.e. no more than 10 absences resulting from occupational accidents lasting at least one day for every million working hours.
