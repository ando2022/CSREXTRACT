COMPANY INFORMATION

2.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
PPC was established in 1950 having as purpose to generate, transmit and distribute electricity throughout the Greek territory. Prior to the establishment of PPC, the right to generate, transmit and distribute electricity had been assigned by the Greek Government to private and municipal electricity companies.
PPC started its operation in 1953 by generating and selling electricity to the abovementioned private and municipal electricity companies. During the period 1957-1963, the Company acquired the above electricity companies, including the Electric Company of Athens - Piraeus Ltd, which used to service the largest urban area of Greece and was generating a significant percentage of the total electricity consumed in the Greek market.
The Laws 1559 and 2244, which were enacted in the years 1985 and 1994 respectively, provided for a relevant exception from PPC's exclusive right in electricity generation mainly in order to give the right to industrial companies to generate electricity for their own consumption. Moreover, said legislation allowed individuals to generate electricity from renewable sources and cogeneration exclusively for commercial use.
By virtue of Law 2773/1999 concerning the liberalization of the electricity market and pursuant to the Presidential Decree 333/2000, PPC, as of January 1st 2001, was converted into a societe anonyme wholly owned by the Greek State having as main purpose the generation and supply of electricity.
In December 2001, following an increase of share capital and an offering of existing shares held by the Hellenic Republic, PPC's shares were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. In parallel, Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) were admitted to London Stock Exchange. As of November 29, 2017, at the request of the Parent Company, GDRs were deleted and their trading on the London Stock Exchange ceased.
The Hellenic Republic further reduced its stake in PPC through secondary offerings in December 2002 and October 2003. As of 31.12.2017 the Hellenic Republic controled, directly (34.123%) or indirectly (17%) through the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), since the HRADF is 100% owned by the Hellenic Republic, thus the Hellenic Republic controled in total the 51.123% of the Company's share capital.
On March 20, 2018, a transfer of 79,165,114 PPC shares (namely 34.123%) by the Hellenic Republic to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP S.A.) was completed by law and without consideration, according to para. 20, article 380 of L. 4512/2018, as amended para. 1 of article 197 of L. 4389/2016.
It is noted that, following the above change, the HCAP S.A. participates directly with 34.123% in PPC's share capital and indirectly with 17% through the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF). The total voting rights of HCAP S.A. amount to 51.123%. The Greek State owns 100% of voting rights in HCAP S.A. The total percentage of the Hellenic Republic remains indirectly, as mentioned above, at 51.123%
After the spin-off of the Transmission and the Distribution segments, two 100% subsidiaries of PPC were created, namely IPTO S.A. (Independent Power Transmission Operator S.A.) and HEDNO S.A. (Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A.). IPTO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, maintenance and development of the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System and its interconnections, while HEDNO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, development and maintenance of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network.
On June 20th 2017 the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA was completed as provided for in articles 142 et seq. of Law 4389/2016.

2.3 OVERVIEW OF COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES
PPC is Greece's largest electricity generator and the principal supplier of electricity in Greece. PPC holds assets in lignite mines, power generation and distribution. Its power portfolio consists of conventional thermal plants (lignite, gas and oil fired), and hydroelectric power plants, as well as Renewable Energy Sources (RES) installations, accounting for approximately 60.6% of the total installed capacity in the country. Specifically PPC is the first company in Greece to install RES (in 1982), and is active through its subsidiary company "PPC Renewables S.A." (PPCR), with a portfolio of wind farms, small scale hydroelectric plants and photovoltaics. In 2017, PPC's generation of 32.6 TWh coupled with the 1.9 TWh that it imported, covered 56.7% of total demand. PPC's energy mix comprised of generation from lignite (50.3%), oil (14.8%), natural gas (23.5%), hydroelectric (10.6%) and renewable energy sources (0.8%). The nearly 7.2 mil. customers of PPC, consumed 86.7% of the total electricity supplied to end-customers in Greece in 2017. The Hellenic Electricity Transmission System, often referred to as the "Interconnected System", spreads over the mainland of Greece. The Ionian islands, along with certain Aegean islands in close proximity to the mainland, are also included in the Interconnected System, to which they are connected through submarine cables. In the Interconnected System, aproximatelly one third of the generation capacity is located in northwestern Greece, in close proximity to the lignite mines, which are the primary fuel source. In the last 3 years, two new, state of the art gas-fired plants were constructed, namely Aliveri V and Megalopolis V, in the southern part of the Interconnected System as well as the new hydroelectric power plant of Ilarion. All remaining islands, which are referred to as the"Non-Interconnected Islands", are served by autonomous oilfired power plants. In most of the islands, demand is also covered by RES. The largest power plants in the NonInterconnected Islands are located in Crete and Rhodes (with total thermal capacity exceeding 1,000 MW).

* Restated figures for 2016 due to a) the re-estimation of "Unbilled revenue" and b) the recalculation of deferred tax on the lower electricity tariff provided to pensioners of PPC Group. The total negative impact of these restatements was  11.4 m on Net income of 2016. In addition, 2015 figures were restated due to the re-estimation of "Unbilled revenue" with a negative impact of  143.4 m on Net income of 2015. These restatements, both for 2015 and 2016, did not have a cash impact, whereas there was no dividend distributed for these years. For further information, please refer to 2017 Annual Financial Report (Note 36).
** This amount does not relate to the cash benefit for PPC from the sale of 49% of IPTO (24% to State Grid and 25% to the Greek State).

The Group's key financial and operating figures excluding IPTO S.A. are the following:
In 2017, EBITDA stood at  804.7 m. The positive impact from the decrease of bad debt provisions by approximately  400 m., and the revenue of  359.8 m. recognized for PSOs for the period 2012 -2016 was offset mainly by factors, such as market share loss as well as additional costs due to the energy crisis during December 2016January 2017 ( 70 m.), the charge of electricity suppliers for the Special Account for Renewables ( 325.2 m.), the net negative impact of "NOME" type auctions ( 92.1 m.) and the increase in the unit charge of the Special Consumption Tax in diesel ( 34.9 m.). On top of that, EBITDA was negatively impacted by increased prices of heavy fuel oil, diesel and natural gas.
Pre - tax profits in 2017, stood at  60.5 m. (including PSOs for the period 2012-2016), compared to  125.4 m. in 2016 (including the  92.9 m. capital return from IPTO).
It is noted that on a cash basis, the amount for PSOs was received in the first quarter of 2018.

Revenues
Turnover decreased in 2017 by  186.2 m. or 3.6% and amounted to  4,943.9 m. compared to  5,130.1 m. in 2016, mainly due to market share loss.
In detail:
· Domestic electricity demand increased by 1.5% in 2017 to 57,845 GWh compared to 56,972 GWh in 2016. Total electricity demand (including exports and pumping) increased by 2.7% in 2017 driven by increased exports
from third parties through interconnections in northern Greece, especially during the last quarter of 2017, due to higher electricity prices in the Balkans and Central Europe electricity markets as well as due to the possibility of exports of quantities acquired by Third parties at competitive prices through "NOME". PPC sales declined in 2017 due to the reduction of its average supply market share. Specifically, PPC's average retail market share in the country declined to 86.7% in 2017 compared to 91.8% in 2016. In particular, PPC's average market share in the Interconnected System, was contained to 85.4% in December

FINANCIAL REPORT

2017 from 89.8% in December 2016, while PPC's average market share per Voltage was 97.3% in High Voltage, 71.5% in Medium Voltage and 88.5% in Low Voltage, compared to 98.6%, 77.1% and 93.1% in December 2016, respectively.
·PPC's electricity generation and imports covered 56.7% of total demand in 2017 (53.7% in the Interconnected System), while the corresponding percentage in 2016 was 54.5% (51.4% in the Interconnected System). PPC's market share in electricity generation, as a percentage of the total load of the Interconnected System was 50.2% compared to 47.6% in 2016.
·Specifically, PPC's electricity generation increased by 2,329 GWh (7.7%), as a result of the increased electricity generation of natural gas fired units by 36.6% (2,053 GWh), as well as lignite units by 10% (1,489 GWh).
On the contrary, hydro generation decreased by 28.6% (1,387 GWh) since due to the overutilization of Hydro Power Plants in January 2017, there was a large reduction of hydro reserves in the reservoirs , which could not be replenished due to the extremely low hydro inflows during the following months of 2017. This situation has already been reversed in the first four months of 2018, providing secure evidence for an increase of hydro generation in 2018.
The aforementioned developments in the energy mix contributed to the total increase of the relevant expenses by 32.9% compared to 2016.
Operating Expenses
The decrease of operating expenses before depreciation was significant and stood at  179.6 m. ( 4,139.2 m. in 2017 from  4,318.8 m. in 2016). Key factors for this reduction was the drastic reduction of bad debt provisions as well as the revenue recognized for past years' PSOs. On the contrary, the additional impact from the charge for the Special Account for Renewables, from "NOME", the energy crisis and from the increase in the unit charge of the Special Consumption Tax in diesel, further increased expenses by  522.2 m.
More specifically:
Energy mix expenditure
·E xpenditure for liquid fuel, natural gas, third parties fossil fuel, CO2 and energy purchases increased by  712.6 m. (32.9%) compared to 2016.
In detail:
- Liquid fuel expense increased by  181.4 m. (37.7%), from  481.2 m. in 2016 to  662.6 m. in 2017 and is attributed to:
- the increase in the expense for the Special Consumption Tax, by  67.6 m. from  145.3 m. in 2016 to  212.9 m. in 2017, due to the aforementioned increase in fuel quantities as well as the increase of the unit charge of the Special Consumption Tax in diesel from  330/kL to  410/kL as of 1.1.2017, which had a negative impact on the Company of  34.9 m.
- the increase of liquid fuel consumption due to higher electricity generation by 189 GWh, in order to meet higher demand in the Non Interconnected Islands as well as the consumption of diesel for the operation of the natural gas fired units of Komotini and Lavrio IV, in order to address the energy crisis at the beginning of the winter and
- the increase of heavy fuel oil and diesel prices expressed in Euros (not including the Special Consumption Tax) by 22.6% and 16.6%, respectively.
- Natural gas expense increased to  409.1 m. (54%) from  265.7 m. in 2016 due to the significant increase of natural gas electricity generation.
- Energy purchases expense from the System and the Network increased by 30.6%, from  1,158 m. in 2016 to  1,512.9 m., despite the lower volume in energy purchases by 20.5%, due to:

- the negative impact of  325.2 m. from the additional charge imposed on electricity suppliers for the Special Account for Renewables:  353.6 m. in 2017 compared to  28.4 m. in 2016,
- the significant increase of the average System Marginal Price (SMP) to  54.7/MWh from  42.8/MWh and
- the additional net expense of  92.1 m.:  96.6 m. in 2017 compared to  4.5 m. in 2016, which is attributed to the negative effect from "NOME" electricity auctions at prices below SMP.
Energy purchases expense includes an additional amount of  24.1 m. which is the net impact from the Transitory Capacity Payment Mechanism, which was in effect until 30.4.2017.
- Expenditure for CO2 emission rights remained practically stable at  181.2 m. since the cost of increased emissions (31.7 m. tonnes compared to 28.4 m. tonnes) was offset by the lower average price of CO2 emission allowances by 8.9% from  6.27/tn to  5.71/tn.
Payroll cost
The total payroll cost, including : capitalized payroll , payroll of seasonal personnel and other personnel related benefits, decreased by  5.4 m. to  891.7 m. in 2017 from  897.1 m. in 2016.

Development & Operation of Networks In 2017, the length of distribution lines increased by 300 km in the medium voltage grids, by 562 km in the LowVoltage grids, while an additional 658 Low/Medium transformers were installed and 2,659 commutations were made. Therefore, the Medium Voltage network extends to 111,859 km and the Low Voltage network extends to 126,360 km while transformers stand at 163,738. Active users of the Distribution network totaled 7,486,139 of which 11,536 in the medium voltage. For the fiscal year 2017 total investment expenditure for the Distribution Network is lower by approximately 44 mil.compared to 2016. The largest decrease (approximately  26 mil.) concerned in iterative projects, of which  21 mil. relate to reinforcements and  5 million to network rerouting.
Turnaround Times of New Connections
In 2017, the average time for the design and construction of basic power supplies was 29 days, while for supplies requiring network construction it was 56 days and 40 days for commutation requests.
Environmental Issues
1,275km of twisted cables have been installed at the Low Voltage network under the generalized use in place of stripline, with positive effects on the environment.
Significant events for the period 01.01.2017 - 31.12.2017
Significant events for the year 2017are presented in detail in Note 40 of the Financial Statements.
Major Risks - Uncertainties
The Group's and the Parent Company's activities are subject to various risks. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. The risks described below are not the only risks that the Group and the Parent Company face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Group and the Parent Company or that are currently deemed to be of minor importance may also have a materially adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial condition, business, results of operations and cash flows.
Macroeconomic conditions in Greece - Imposition of capital Controls
By the Legislative Act of 06/28/2015 (GG 65 A / 06.28.2015) a bank holiday was declared while capital controls were imposed. The bank holiday ended on 07.20.2015, while capital controls remain in effect, but gradually relaxing. Capital controls include limitations on cash withdrawals and restrictions on payments abroad. Due to the fact that the Group and the Parent Company are almost exclusively operating in Greece, any change and development at the macro and micro environment of the country, directly and very significantly affects their activities, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
Credit Risk
The Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects depend highly on the social and macroeconomic conditions in Greece, as practically almost all of the Group's assets and economic activities are in Greece. Despite the fact that, electricity sales are dispersed over a large number of customers with a wide and diversified range of operations, the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent on their customers' ability to repay their obligations. The current economic environment, the imposition of capital controls and the recent intense recession had a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity, mainly resulting from:
· Difficulties in payment and increases in delayed payments, by Low and Medium voltage customers as well as High voltage customers. Despite the fact that a large number of the Parent Company's customers have
45

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

concluded favorable settlements for the payment of their overdue electricity bills and the granting of a uniform discount of 15% to all Low and Medium Voltage residential and business consumers, provided they timely pay their current bills and observe any settlement concluded or to be concluded, the number of customers that will observe the terms of their settlement in effect is uncertain. Already a significant percentage of settlements is canceled through an automated procedure by PPC's IT systems due to customers' non-compliance to the respective terms.
· A sizeable number of enterprises, especially small and medium sized which cease their operations due to the economic conjecture leaving teir electricity bills unpaid.
· T he prospective increase of the Social Solidarity Tariff (SRT) beneficiaries along with the increased difficulty that these customers face in paying their electricity bills.
· T he lack of the ability to transfer debts of the same customer between its various electricity bills for household use, which accounts for the majority of customers (70% of the customers).
· Incidents where customers (both household and commercial) with debts due to electricity consumption or electricity theft, attempt to change their electricity supplier under a different name (or a different Tax Identification Number) in order to avoid restrictions that the Electricity Code imposes.
· The fact that some customers under the pretext of the current economic downturn are not fulfilling their obligations or delay their payments, despite the fact that they afford to do so.
· Customers not accepting charges that are not directly related to electricity consumption, but constitute a significant portion of the electricity bill (e.g. PSOs and Renewables levy).
The Group and the Parent Company may also face difficulties or delays in their ability to collect payments from their customers as a result of additional new measures that burden electricity bills with new or increased charges in favor of third parties, such as the Renewables levy (ETMEAR). This might extend the delay of collecting electricity bills and create additional needs of working capital for the Parent Company, bearing also in mind that ETMEAR, amongst others, is paid to the competent authorities regardless of whether it has been collected from the Parent Company's customers. Additionally, the Parent Company's collection enforcement mechanisms may be affected by legislation or other administrative acts, (for example by restricting disconnections for non-payment of electricity bills for certain categories of customers or in areas that are declared to be in an emergency state, where customers benefiting from such decisions stop paying their bills), which can adversely affect the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Liquidity Risk
The current macroeconomic and financial environment in Greece, especially after the imposition of capital controls, which remains volatile, may have a considerable adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business activity, financial position and prospects. Currently, the economic situation in Greece has directly affected the capital levels, liquidity and financial position of the Greek financial system, which highly affects the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity and access to credit as well as the liquidity of the Greek economy as a whole and the Group's as well as the Parent Company's customers' ability to access credit. In addition, access to foreign financial markets is affected. Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows for the financing of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as the servicing of the Group's and the Parent Company's debt.
The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including:
· The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills.
· T he obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT when due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected from the Group's and the Parent Company's customers.
46

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

· The burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying in the same time amounts due to third parties.
· T he continuous increase in the number of disadvantaged citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding (a) a longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue). b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest; c) limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.
· R egulatory measures on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as a Supplier (new charges for the RES Account).
· T he potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.
The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs for accessing and finding liquidity ( for refinancing existing debt and / or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years.
Risk from Exposure to the Banking Sector
The Group and the Parent Company may be exposed to risks arising for the Greek banking sector (for example limitations effected by the Single Supervising Mechanism (SSM) of the ECB on loans for Public Entities). It should be noted that as of December 31st 2017 the Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations towards the Greek banking sector amounted to 37,1% of its total loan obligations.
Interest Rate Risk and Foreign Currency Risk
The Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations consist of bank loans, bonds and overdrafts. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution of the loan portfolio between fixed and variable interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio. As of December 31 st 2017 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging. Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars, the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that a) any undertaken hedging transactions may not provide full or adequate protection against these risks and b) capital controls and Greece's as well as the greek banking sector's economic situation significantly limit the ability of the Parent Company in undertaking derivative hedging transactions to cover currency risk.
Credit Rating Risk
The Group's and the Parent Company's ability to access capital markets and other forms of financing (or refinancing), and the costs associated with such activities, depend in part on their credit rating witch is closely related to that of the Greek State as well as to the greek banking sector's credit rating. Following the financial crisis, international rating agencies apply stricter criteria in the area of liquidity adequacy, and, as a result, even if a company has ensured, among other things, a reliable coverage plan for its capital needs, it faces the risk of a rating downgrade in the event that it does not fulfil the new stricter criteria. In the event that the Group's and the Parent Company's credit or debt ratings are lowered by the rating agencies,
47

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

the Group and the Parent Company may not be able to raise additional indebtedness on terms similar to their existing indebtedness or at all, and their ability to access credit and bond markets as well as other forms of financing (or refinancing) could be limited or impossible.
Commodity Price Risk and Risk From the Electricity Market
The Parent Company is exposed to the risk of an increase in prices of oil, natural gas, electricity purchased from the System and the Network, CO2 emission rights as well as electricity prices of direct PPC imports. The Parent Company has established a policy of oil hedging transactions, based on which the implementation of specific hedging transactions is decided on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing circumstances. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions, may not provide full or adequate protection against this risk. The Parent Company has not established a hedging policy against the risk arising from the volatility of natural gas prices.
Currently, and taking into consideration that a large proportion of the Parent Company's supplier of natural gas (DEPA) imports are from GAZROM through a pipeline that passes through Ukraine, there is a potential risk that problems may arise for the continuation of natural gas' supply to power generating units using natural gas as a fuel, as well as increases in electricity production costs or/and increases in the SMT. These additional costs might not be fully recoverable through electricity bills, adversely affecting the Group's and the Parent Company's operational results and liquidity.
In terms of the risk arising from increased electricity purchase prices, it is hedged less and less by the Parent Company's vertical integration (internal hedge), since PPC's average share in the wholesale market as of December 31st 2017 amounted to 54.2%, while at the same period, PPC Supply's average share in the retail market amounted to 88.2%.
Additionally, prices of the main materials (metals, etc.), except fuel, used by the Group and the Parent Company for their operation and development are determined on the international commodity markets, resulting to the Group's and the Parent Company's exposure to the risk of fluctuation of the relevant prices as well as to foreign currency risk.
CO2 Emission Rights
The Group's and Parent Company's generation business is subject to EU Directives 2003/87/EC and 2009/29/EC, which established the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In order to operate its bound thermal power plants, PPC is required to acquire and deliver CO2 emission rights under the EU ETS (the "EU Allowances" or "EUAs") to cover CO2 emissions.
Since 2013, PPC is no longer allocated free CO2 emission rights (with the exception of small quantities corresponding to thermal power generation for district heating) and as it's thermal power plants currently emit 30 Mt of CO2 approximately on an annual basis, increased prices of CO2 emission rights will affect its operating costs. As PPC must acquire sufficient amounts of CO2 emission rights per year, there can be no assurance on the price level that such CO2 emission rights will be obtained in any future year. For the period from 2013 to 2020, the Parent Company expects to acquire the required CO2 emission rights from both the European and international markets, either through exchange transactions or through bilateral agreements. Although the Parent Company attempts to manage the risk arising from potentially increasing CO2 emission rights prices by monitoring markets and developments in Europe, as well as changes in the relevant regulatory framework, it is not possible to guarantee that this risk will be completely offset.
The exposure of the Parent Company to the risk of increasing CO2 emission rights prices is linked to its ability to fully incorporate these increases in its electricity tariffs. Therefore, any increase in CO2 emission rights prices could materially, directly or indirectly, affect the Group's and the Parent Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
It should also be noted that the process of reforming the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for the period 2021-2030 is nearing its completion. CO2 emission rights prices and the Company's compliance cost will be affected by this reform, as well as by the already adopted regulations amending the EU-ETS (i.e. the withdrawal of significant quantities from CO2 rights auctions (backloading) in the early years of the period 2013-2020, and
48

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) which aims to actively control the supply of CO2 rights from 2019 onwards).
Risk of Exposure in Competition
The Parent Company faces intense competition mainly in the wholesale market where share loss is due to IPPs' power plants and the increased penetration of Renewables units in the System and the Network, as well as to increased electricity imports from the neighboring countries. In the current situation of very low gas prices and very low wholesale electricity prices in most energy Exchanges in neighboring countries, competition in the wholesale market in Greece is very strong, with high loading of the gas fueled thermal units and a very high volume of electricity imports. Adverse changes in the competitive environment through the continuation of existing and/or creation of new regulatory or / and legislative mechanisms (i.e. after the completion of the second evaluation of the Greek Republic's Funding Program) in the electricity market which strengthen the Group's competitors may have a negative impact on its results of operations and cash flows.
For instance, RAE recently introduced into public consultations a new transitory Capacity Assurance Mechanism, as well as a proposed new Variable Cost Recovery Mechanism for electricity generation units. For the variable cost recovery, L. 4336/2015 provides that "Until September 2015 the Authorities shall modify the regulations of the electricity market in order to prevent the necessity of plants' operating below their variable cost", while for the Capacity Assurance Mechanism, the same Law provides that «Until September 2015 the Authorities will apply a regime for the temporary and permanent capacity payments' system». RAE put into effect a new "Variable Cost Recovery Mechanism" with its decision 392/2015 and specified the mechanism implementation details by its decision 468/2015.
Regarding the Capacity Assurance Mechanism (both temporary and permanent), final results and decisions on the permanent mechanism are pending (a set of RAE's proposals is under public consultation from July 27th 2016) while the temporary mechanism is already in effect. The transitory capacity assurance mechanism, which for the time being is called the "Transitional Flexibility Assurance Mechanism", was enacted with L. 4389/2016 and its implementation details were determined with RAE's decision 284/2016. Its duration was twelve (12) months at the most from the date of its enactment on May 1st 2016 and therefore expired on April 30st 2017. The temporary mechanism compensated only natural gas fueled thermal units and part of hydroelectric ones (lignite fueled units were excluded). This treatment created a competitive disadvantage for PPC's electricity generation portfolio (mainly lignite units) in relation to its competitors in the wholesale market (exclusively gas units). The Unique Compensation Price for the provision of flexible capacity was set to  45/ kW for a twelve (12) month period, with an upper compensation limit of Euro fifteen ( 15) mil. per production unit., while the total annual compensation amount of the mechanism has been set to Euro two hundred twenty five ( 225) mil. All the above mentioned mechanisms (variable cost recovery, transitional flexibility assurance and permanent capacity assurance) may have a considerable impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's operation, cash flows and financial results.
RAE, in September 2017, put into Public Consultation the basic specifications of a new Capacity Mechanism («Transitional Flexibility Assurance Facility»), which is proposed to enter into force during the transition period until the new Target Model electricity markets are effectively implemented. The proposed mechanism, given its transitory nature, is similar in some of its basic parameters to the previous Transitional Flexibility Assurance Mechanism, in particular regarding the services to be compensated, the eligibility criteria of its providers and the establishment of a control procedure for their compliance with the imposed requirements. However, the introduction of tender procedures for the determination of unit compensation is an element of substantial diversification. The new Transitional Flexibility Assurance Mechanism is proposed to be effective until the implementation of the institutional framework under which the new electricity markets (futures, next day, intraday, balancing) will operate, in line with the EU framework «Target Model». PPC has the position that, on the one hand, there is no shortage of flexibility in the Electricity System (and therefore, there is no need for specific compensation of the service) and on the other hand that flexibility is mainly contributed both by the hydroelectric units and the lignite units, while at the same time the Greek system especially in the medium to short term, is more likely to face the risk of a lack of sufficient power than of the flexibility to provide power. Consequently, a permanent mechanism should be effected as soon as possible, which should compensate the availability of electricity in a fair manner, without discriminating between technologies and unit fuels, being
49

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

as well a purchasing mechanism so that the compensation of the units to be freely derived from supply and demand. Also, suppliers of electricity should be able to participate in this mechanism from the side of electricity demand, in order to be taken into account in calculating the needs for adequate system power and the potential for border interconnections.
Tariff Risk for the Competitive Activities
Following the liberalization of High and Medium Voltage tariffs, Low Voltage tariffs are fully liberalized from July 1st 2013 for end customers, excluding vulnerable ones. However a number of factors affect the Parent Company's ability and freedom to formulate the competitive component of tariffs, in order to be cost effective, such as the ability of customers to cope with new possibly increased tariffs, initiatives of the Greek Government, decisions of the Regulator etc., especially in view of the current socioeconomic condition in Greece. Furthermore, the Parent Company may face difficulties incorporating a potentially increased commodity cost, as well as costs related to electricity and CO2 emission rights to electricity bills, through increased tariffs.
Concerning the HV customers:
There were several tariff disputes, between ALOUMINION of Greece (ALOUMINION) and PPC since the termination of the initial (dating back to 1960) electricity supply contract of the said customer. The dispute about electricity price between the two parties was submitted before the Arbitration Court at RAE, which issued its decision on October 31st, 2013, setting the sale price of the energy component of the electricity at  36.6/MWh for the time period from July 1st 2010 to December 31st 2013. PPC has filed an appeal for the annulment of the Arbitration Decision and a complaint to the European Commission (Commission) for state aid due to the price set by the arbitration court. Regarding PPC's complaint to the European Commission, the Commission, by a letter / decision of June 12th 2014, informed PPC that it did not intend to further examine its complaint. The Commission subsequently issued on March 25th 2015 a decision which found that PPC's complaint required no further investigation because no state aid existed. PPC appealed (on June 29th 2015) before the General Court against this decision (as well as against the above mentioned first letter / decision). Subsequently, on August 23th 2017, the Commission notified PPC of its new Decision (number (2017) 5622 final), which, according to the text of this new Decision, revokes both the 2014 letter and its confirmatory decision of 2015, replacing them with the new Decision. With this new Decision, the Commission has accepted that the measure in question does not constitute state aid for the same reasons as it set out in its 2015 Decision, which it repealed. PPC has lawfully appealed against this Decision and the hearing of the case is expected. Regarding PPC's petition for annulment, the Athens Court of Appeal issued on February 18th 2016 a decision, which did not accept PPC's petition. PPC has not appealed to the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal's decision. Despite the discount approved on HV tariffs by the Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders of February 28th 2014, ALOUMINION only paid part of the electricity bills amounts. Given that PPC proceeded on January 2nd 2015 to an order for the deactivation of ALOUMINION's load meters and invited IPTO to proceed to all necessary actions, ALOUMINION has filed to RAE (on January 9th 2015) a complaint ­application for interim measures PPC, which was notified to IPTO. RAE, by a letter addressed to all parties postponed the discussion and the taking of a decision on the application. On March 20th 2015 a document of the Competition Committee (CC) was notified to PPC, by which CC asked the submission of PPC's views on a memo submitted by ALOUMINION. At the set date of the hearing (September 25th 2015), CC interrupted the discussion of the case for October 14th 2015 (its next Meeting date) and granted to PPC a deadline for submitting a commitment proposal under the provisions of Law 3959/2011. After the discussion of the case, PPC submitted the relevant commitments Note undertaking that : a) within ten (10) days of the notification of the CC's decision, PPC would proceed in recalling the order for the deactivation of ALOUMINION's load meters which has been sent by PPC to ALOUMINION and IPTO SA. and b) that It will continue to supply electricity to ALOUMINION under the current terms and conditions, until the issue of ALOUMINION's electricity tariffs, will be resolved through either direct negotiation between the parties or by any other means. The above mentioned PPC's commitments were accepted by the CC, which issued the relevant
50

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

decision (621/2015). Abiding by its commitments, PPC recalled the order for the deactivation of ALOUMINION's load meters. Negotiations between the two parties to reach an agreement on tariff policy for ALUMINION for the period from January 1st 2014 onwards had not yet been resolved when The «Electricity Supply Agreement between PPC S.A. and ALOUMINION OF GREECE S.A" agenda item was introduced at the 14th Annual General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders dated July 11th 2016, which decided to postpone its decision on the matter for the next General Meeting. On September 13th 2016 PPC's BoD decided to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders on October 5th 2016. On the latter's agenda the above mentioned matter was included.
The Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders approved on October 5th 2016 ALOUMINION's pricing terms for the period July 1st 2016 - December 31st 2020, as well as the pricing terms for the period January 1st 2014 - June 30th 2016. In accordance with the EGM's decisions, a Supply Agreement was signed on October 20th 2016 between ALUMINION and PPC. Under the signed agreement, ALOUMINION (currently "MYTILINEOS S.A. - GROUP OF COMPANIES") proceeded to a prepayment of  100 mil for future electricity bills for the first contractual period July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017, as well as to a prepayment of  29.1 mil for the second contractual period of July 1st 2017 to June 30th 2018.
Furthermore, LARCO, the Parent Company's largest outstanding debtor, is liable for sums due and payable to PPC related to the consumption of electricity and was systematically paying only a small part of its electricity consumption bills. Given that LARCO has challenged electricity tariffs for the period from July 1st 2010 to December 31st 2013, both parties had resorted to arbitration to determine the price of electricity for the said period, as well as the settlement of LARCO's debts to PPC. The Arbitration Court with its Decision No 13/15.02.2017 the supply electricity price for LARCO to 43.41 / MWh plus the CO2 emission rights charges, the regulated charges as well as other taxes and fees.
In the meantime, PPC' BoD added on the agenda of PPC's Shareholders Extraordinary General Meeting of January 12th 2017 for approval, LARCO's pricing terms, as well as the settlement of LARCO's debts from previous years. PPC's Shareholders EGM approved LARCO's with its Decision 12/09.01.2017 the pricing terms for the period January 1st 2016 to December 31th 2020, as well as the settlement of LARCO's debts for the period July 1st 2010 to December 31st 2016. LARCO's Shareholders General Meeting respectively, approved the aforementioned electricity supply contract in order to proceed to signing it. Moreover, in order for PPC to secure the payment of its receivables under the Electricity Supply Contract, it was decided to sign a pledge agreement on a LARCO's specific account for the sum of at least of 3 million monthly. After the approval of the terms by the General Shareholders Meetings of the two companies, they proceeded to signing the electricity supply contract as well as the pledge agreement on June 21st 2017. The new pricing terms for LARCO S.A., as provided in the 21.06.2017 June 21st 2017 electricity supply agreement, would allow LARCO S.A. to be consistent with its obligations to PPC and allow it to proceed with the preparation of its new strategic planning aiming at its long-term viability. Although actions of the Management of LARCO S.A. have taken place, that were supported by the Greek State for the preparation of a new business plan aimed at improving its financial situation, it can not be assertained that LARCO S.A. will honor in the future its obligations. PPC, in order to protect its interests, has already proceeded to the actions provided for in the above contracts due to the non-observance of the contractual obligations by LARCO S.A.
Similarly, other industrial customers do not fully pay their electricity consumption bills alleging either lack of liquidity due to the adverse economic environment or non ­ acceptance of the competitive charges of the relevant tariffs. Although LARCO's Management has implemented measures and actions (with the support of greek government) in order to prepare a new business plan, aiming to improve its economic situation, there is no assurance that LARCO or such other industrial customers will discharge their debts for the amounts billed in relation to their electricity consumption.
Any such events as described above may have a material adverse effect on the Parent Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
PPC offers from January 1st 2016 to HV customers seven (7) new tariffs for Competitive Charges, which practically correspond to the distinct consumption profiles of these customers. These tariffs are applicable for electricity consumption for the period January 1st 2016 up to December 31st 2017 and customers are entitled to choose
51

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

between a monthly and a ten day period billing. These new tariffs are accompanied by incentives (discounts) to HV customers for high electricity consumption during the Minimum Load Zone (nights, weekends and holidays). In addition to the above, the Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders of December 7th 2015 decided on the duration period for the new tariffs, on the provision of volume discounts for the competitive load and energy charges based on the total annual HV electricity consumption for individual Companies or Group of companies.
Risk from Regulated Rates of Return on Network Activities
The regulated rates of return on Network investments combined with the approved by the Regulator asset base on which depreciation and returns are calculated, may have a negative impact on the Groups' profitability and value, if they do not provide for a reasonable return on the invested capital and an adequate additional incentive for future strategic investments. As a result, any changes in regulated charges that may affect the Group's revenues from electricity distribution could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as to hamper the Group's ability to raise equity or loans for funding its investment plans.
Risks from the implementation of Law 4412/08.08.2016 (integration of the EU Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU provisions)
From August 8th 2016 Law 4412/2016 (Procurement Works, Supplies and Services), has come into effect, which applies, in accordance with the specific provisions in it, on the procurement and project implementation contract procedures of PPC. Since according to the above mentioned Law the activities of PPC Group fall within its provisions, the «Regulation on Works, Supplies and Services acquired by PPC (Board Decision 206/30.09.2008)» are included in the repealed provisions of the said Law, some provisions of it need to be further clarified via ministerial decrees and new procedures concerning publications and implementation are coming into force (indicatively a new Body judges and issues awards on disputes arising during the bidding procedures, and following that, in case that a party questions the correctness of the above award, the administrative courts are competent to issue award on the dispute ), there is a possibility that delays will occur concerning Procurement and Contract execution, resulting to an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's smooth running of their business activities.
Regulatory Risk
Potential modifications to the regulatory and legislative framework governing the electricity market, such as the implementation of EU legislation, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policy, as well as decisions by RAE concerning the regulation and functioning of the Greek electricity market in general, as well as any restructuring or other changes to the Group's business due to the compliance to the regulatory framework, may have a materially adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Group's and the Parent Company's business and capital investment activity program are subject to decisions of numerous national, international and European Union institutions, as well as to regulatory and administrative authorities. Such authorities may issue decisions that restrict or significantly affect the Group's and the Parent Company's operations without taking into account and weigh all the relevant factors and interdependences which affect the Group's and the Parent Company's business and operations and may adversely impact the Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, given the increased human, technical and financial resources needed to respond to decisions by the Regulator or other national or international institutions, the Group and the Parent Company cannot give any assurance that they will be at all times in a position to fully and timely satisfy the regulatory, environmental, financial, and any other requirements imposed by the above mentioned authorities.
Risk from providing Public Service Obligations (PSOs)
The PSOs for which the Parent Company is entitled to compensation relate to (a) the supply of electricity to
52

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

the Non-Interconnected Islands (NII) at the same tariffs as those in the Interconnected System, (b) the supply of electricity at special rates to families with more than three children, (c) the supply of electricity to the beneficiaries of the Social Residential Tariff ("SRT") which is currently provided to persons of low income, families with three or more children, long-term unemployed, people with special needs and people on life support and (d) the supply of electricity at special rates to public welfare entities. PSO compensation is based on the relevant costs incurred by PPC and other electricity suppliers providing PSOs and is calculated according to a methodology published by RAE. Despite the fact that in 2017 with RAE's Decision 688/2017, the PSO compensation for the years 2014 - 2016 was determined (for the NII), unit charges per customer category established with Law 4067/2012 for the recovery by electricity Suppliers of the compensation, remained stable, resulting to under recovery of the approved by RAE compensation and a high cumulative deficit for the years 2012 - 2016. In order for new unit charges per customer category to be determined and integrated to electricity bills a legislative act was required. Such legislative act has not been effected from the Ministry of Environment and Energy. After the issuance of RAE's Decision 688/2017 PPC raised objections with RAE on the correctness of applying the methodology for calculating the PSO compensation for the Non-Interconnected Islands for the years 2014-2016, resulting in a lower compensation for the years in question of approximately 44mil. To this end, the PPC has initiated appropriate legal proceedings before the competent courts. With RAE's opinion 10/2017 to the competent ministry, RAE in principle considers that with Law 4067/2012 there has been a change in the recovery period of the PSO compensation from the deferred refund system in force until then, according to which the annual compensation due for the provision of PSOs was recovered in the following calendar year, to a simultaneous recovery system according to which the annual compensation due is recovered in the same calendar year. Based on the above mentioned opinion, the cumulative deficit as identified by RAE stands at  359.8 million for the period 2012-2016. After the amendment of Law 4067/2012 by Law 4501/2017, the possibility to cover (in whole or in part) the cost of providing PSO's from the state budget was established, provided that a Ministerial Decision from the part of the Minister of Finance was issued. For the implementation of the above mentioned provision, an amount of  476 mil. was paid from the state budget to the PSO special management account held by IPTO SA in order to be subsequently reimbursed to the recipients of the PSO compensation. From the above mentioned amount PPC received  359,8 mil. In the first quarter of 2018. Subsequently, by Law 4508 / 2017, effective 2018 new PSO unit costs were determined for the recovery of the PSO compensation, together with a procedure for revising them in order to avoid any cumulative deficits, in the future, in the PSO special management account. Taking into consideration the above mentioned RAE's opinion 10/2017 and legislative changes, PPC is deprived of the PSO compensation for the year 2011 amounting to  681.7 mil. which would have been normally recovered in 2012 with the deferral system which was applicable then. To this end, the Greek State should ensure that PPC also recovers the PSO compensation for the year 2011. Potential changes in compensation rights for the existing PSOs that PPC provides, or changes in the calculation methodology of such PSO compensation, which do not allow the full recovery of PPC's costs, or partial recovery of PSO compensation for previous years, or a potential introduction of new PSOs for which PPC may not be entitled to full compensation may have an adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's costs, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Other Regulatory Risks - Uncertainties
Given the fact that the wholesale energy market model and certain Decisions issued by RAE are transitional, the framework of the energy market remains volatile, with constantly new regulatory decisions and related developments, which may have an adverse impact on PPC's business and financial condition. For example, the introduction of certain regulatory measures in the Greek wholesale electricity market in the
53

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

past has benefited certain new power producers at the expense of existing market participants. These include measures such as the Variable Cost Recovery Mechanism (VCRM), the transitional and permanent Capacity Assurance Mechanism (CAM) and the introduction of measures to promote Renewables penetration mainly through the provision of fixed feed-in tariffs for Renewables, as well as the new methodology for calculating the price paid by suppliers to RES generators in the wholesale market.
Although some of these measures were transitional ­ like the transitional CAM (the "Transitional Flexibility Assurance Mechanism" according to L. 4389/2016) which expired on April 16th 2017, there can be no assurance that replacement regulatory measures which may create new distortions or market effects that are unfavourable to PPC will not be introduced. To the extent that such measures remain, or similar new measures are implemented, the Group's results of operations and profitability may be negatively affected.
Furthermore, the deficit of EMO for Renewables which is due to the fact that the total income of the relevant Renewables account with HEMO does not cover the regulated fixed feed-in tariff paid to Renewables producers creates uncertainty and related cash flow issues in the market. The primary sources of income for this account are the amounts that Suppliers pay for Renewables generated electricity, the special Renewables levy paid by Customers (ETMEAR), which as already mentioned limits their ability for the timely payment of their electricity bills and various other smaller amounts according to the relevant legislation.
According to L. 4111/2013, the deficit should have been reduced to zero by the end of 2014 and since this was not possible, additional measures were put into effect.
More specifically according to Law.4152 / 2013, the price that Suppliers paid to purchase electricity generated from Renewables from the Pool, was determined in such a way as to reflect at the minimum the average variable cost of conventional thermal power plants, which had an adverse impact on the Parent Company's results of operations and cash flows.
Furthermore, additional measures have been taken under the provisions of L. 4254/2014 to reduce the deficit.
Because the above measures have not led to the achievement of a zero deficit, according to the provisions of Article 23 of Law 4414/2016 (New operating aid scheme for RES) a new charge was imposed on Load Representatives (electricity suppliers), in order for the deficit of HEMO's RES Account to be reduced to zero by the end of 2017.
In particular, Load Representatives are required to pay a charge on the total energy absorbed by them from the wholesale market for their customers (excluding exports) multiplied by the difference between the System Marginal Price (SMP) in the wholesale market and the SMP that would have existed if the RES did not enter to the system. Specifically, the Load Representatives will be charged gradually as follows: for the fourth quarter of 2016 the charge amounts to 50% of the charge resulting from the application of the above methodology and for 2017 and onwards the charge amounts to 100%. This charge has a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial results and cash flows.
There is also no assurance that the Greek State will no further increase the cost of purchasing Renewables energy by Suppliers in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition.
EMO is operating at a considerable deficit, in part caused by the due and unpaid obligations of two major alternative energy suppliers who exited the market in 2012. Following RAE's Decision 285/2013, the deficit created by the exit of the aforementioned electricity suppliers was allocated to wholesale conventional generators, proportionally to their market share.
EMO applying the transitional provisions of Article 92 of the Electricity Trade Code initially allocated the account deficit to electricity generators. The total amount of  96.6 mil. .corresponding to PPC's generation activity was divided in seven monthly installments of  13.8 mill each, starting in August 2013.
PPC considered that EMO's alleged claim violates fundamental principles of law, while simultaneously neither the amount nor the reasons for this claim are substantiated. In addition, the relevant RAE Decision was contested in court. In particular, PPC had already filed an application for annulment of RAE's Decision 285/2013, before the Council of State, as well as, an action for suspension of such Decision, until a final judgment is issued by the Council of State. The hearing for the application for the annulment took place on March 18, 2014. In the meantime, the Council of State had issued an interim Decision (n. 62/2014), which suspended the payment of
54

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

50% of the amount of  96.6 mil., which is attributable to PPC. At the same time, EMO has filed a lawsuit in the Multimember Court of First Instance for an amount of  55 mil. which is the equivalent of four (4) equal installments out of the total amount of  96.6 mil. The hearing of this lawsuit was scheduled after postponement for June 7, 2017 when it was canceled. The above mentioned case depended on the State Council's decision for the validity of RAE's Decision 285/2013, which constitutes the legal basis of the dispute at the First Instance Court. PPC, following the State Council's interim decision, has recognized in its books since 2014 a provision of 50% of the amount of  96.6 mil. due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of this amount in the future. In September 2016, PPC's application for annulment of RAE's Decision 285/2013 was rejected by the State Council (Section D', decision 1761/2016). As a consequence, PPC recognized the remaining 50% of the above amount in the results for the six month period ended on June 30th 2016. However, after the issuance of such final decision of the State Council, EMO implementing the provisions of Article 61 of the Electricity Trade Code, allocated the whole deficit amounting to  129.3 mil to Electricity Suppliers (Load Representatives) taking into account their share in the electricity supply market at the time the deficit arose. The allocated to PPC deficit amounted to  126.4 mil. PPC reserving all its legal rights, approved the payment of the remaining deficit of  71.8 mil. in 12 equal interest free installments starting in January 2017. Furthermore in order to ensure it's legal and financial rights PPC filled with the Athens Multi-Member Court of First Instance a counterclaim against HEMO (LAGIE SA) claiming a compensation amount equal to the abovementioned allocated deficit. This or any similar decisions by RAE in the future, addressing electricity market deficits, through allocation of these obligations to other parties, for example by prohibiting setting off amounts the Group and the Parent Company owe to HEMO with amounts owed to the Group and the Parent Company by HEMO (for example the compensation for the photovoltaic on the roofs program) may have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, cash flows and cash.
Risk from the Potential Implementation of Measures Relating to the Electricity and Natural Gas Market Harmonization to the European legislation and Practices
Negotiation between the Hellenic Republic, the European Union, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund for reviewing the terms for Greece's financing program provides for decisions and relevant actions for the electricity market. The unsuccessful analytical planning and/ or implementation of these actions may create significant risks for the Group and the Parent Company. Any potential modification or/and additions of the electricity market legislation and regulatory framework, in order to implement the European Union legislation as well as for the implementation of Law 4336/2015 (Pension provisions - Ratification of the Agreement Plan for the Financial Assistance from the European Stability Mechanism and Arrangements for the implementation of the Funding Agreement), of Law 4389/2016 (Urgent Provisions for the implementation of the Financial Targets and Structural Reforms Agreement and other provisions), of Law 4414/2016 (New operating aid scheme for RES) and Decision No. 57/19.5.2017 of the Government's Economic Policy Council (Structural measures for the access of PPC SA to lignite), as well as the amendments and / or supplements to Law 4512/2018 (Regulations for the implementation of the structural reforms of the Economic Adjustment Programme and other provisions) on issues relating to the establishment and operation of the Energy Exchange Market in the context of the reorganization of the Greek electricity market, thus implementing European and National legislation to complete the single European electricity market, may have a significant impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's activities, contractual commitments and financial results. Similarly, the package of Directives, Regulatory Decisions, Guidelines, etc. announced by the European Commission on November 30th 2016 under the general title «Clean Energy Package», which concerns the period 2021- 2030 and is currently under consultation between the European Institutions (Parliament, Commission and Council), may have a significant impact on the Group and the Parent Company.
Risk relating to Forward Electricity Products Auctions
Under the provisions of Law 4336/2015, PPC's market share both in the wholesale electricity market as well as in the retail electricity market should be immediately reduced by 25%, while from January 1st 2020 no entity will
55

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

be allowed to either generate or import - directly or indirectly- energy quantities greater than 50% of the total energy quantity either generated or imported, annually in the country. The Competition Commission will assess the possibility of achieving the above mentioned objective by January 1st 2019 and in case of failure to achieve it, will propose appropriate measures. In case of the companies' non-compliance, fines amounting to 5% up to 10% on the annual turnover of the previous year will be imposed. Laws 4389/2016 and 4472/2017 as well as Decisions 35/2016, 38/2016, 58/2017, 68/2017 and 77/2018 of the Government's Council for the Economic Policy determine PPC's share market levels in the retail market for the period 2016 ­ 2019 (87.24% for 2016, 75.24% for 2017, 62.24% for 2018 and 49.25% for 2019) as well as other key features for Regulated Forward Electricity Products Auctions, including cost elements that should be taken into account for the calculation of the Auctions' starting price. It should be pointed out that in the context of the changes in the Greek energy market and the transition from the current Mandatory Pool model to the Target Model it is contemplated by the aforementioned decisions of the Government's Council for the Economic Policy that the Special Purpose Regulatory Mechanism (NOME) has been designed in a way as to be applicable irrespective of the underlying regulatory framework.
The first auction of forward electricity products was scheduled to take place by the end of September 2016 and the physical deliveries to start in the fourth quarter of 2016. Beneficiaries of forward products would be licensed suppliers (which would be registered in a special register solely for forward electricity products purposes) with the exception of PPC and other industrial electricity consumers. More specifically, industrial electricity consumers may not buy forward products unless they maintain or develop a separate electricity supply activity.
Eventually, the first auction took place on October 25th 2016 for 460 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period, from December 1st 2016 to November 30th 2017. The second auction took place on January 31st 2017 for 145 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period, from March 1st 2017 to February 28th 2018. The third auction took place on April 26th 2017 for 145 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period, from June 1st 2017 to May 31st 2018, on July 19th 2017 the fourth auction took place. for 145 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period, from September 1st 2017 to August 31st 2018, on October 25th 2017 the fifth auction took place for 718 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period from December 1st 2017 to November 30th 2017 and on February 7th 2018 the sixth auction took place for 400 MW of electricity for a twelve (12) month period from March 1st 2018 to February 28th 2019.
With the Joint Ministerial Decision FIN.182348 (OG B' 2848/07.09.16) the methodology for the determination of the starting forward products auction's prices was established as well as the therefrom resulting price for the first period of implementation of the mechanism, which amounted to 37.37 / MWh. The abovementioned price was set considering the total lignite and hydroelectric production for 2015 as well as PPC's variable costs as further defined in this Joint Ministerial Decision. The abovementioned starting price was applicable for the first three (3) forward products auctions. On July 2017, the above mentioned minimum price was updated using the same calculation methodology on the actual data for the year 2016 resulting in a new starting price of 32.05 / MWh. This price was used for the fourth, the fifth and the sixth auction and will be applicable for all prospective auctions until the end of June 2018.
The quantities, the price and the other characteristics of regulated forward electricity products auctions may have a significant impact on the financial position, operating results, liquidity and prospects of the Parent Company. Especially in terms of quantities - and despite the fact that Law 4389/2016 provided for the quantities of forward electricity products to be auctioned each year to be a percentage of the annual demand of 8% for 2016, 12% for 2017, 13% for 2018 and 13% for 2019, Law 4472/2017 eventually establishes increased annual quantities of forward electricity products to be auctioned: 16% of the annual demand for 2017, 19% for 218 and 22% for 2019. These increased quantities are valid provided that the annual target of PPC's market share decrease as provided by Law 4389/2016 is met, while if PPC's market share exceeds the annual target by more than two (2) percentage points, then the annual quantities to be auctioned will increase accordingly, which may have a particularly adverse effect on the liquidity, the financial results and the prospects of the Parent Company.
The Parent Company is already facing strong competition in the retail electricity market, after the liberization of tariffs for Low Voltage customers due to the operation of third party electricity suppliers, in the a situation of very low prices in the wholesale electricity market. Competition in the retail market is expected to intensify as a result of the implementation of forward electricity products auctions, as well as due to the other provisions of Laws 4336/2015, 4389/2016 and 4472/2017
56

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

More specifically the Parent Company is expected to face increasing competition in the retail electricity market if compelled to sell energy to its competitors (alternative suppliers) at low prices, in order for them to increase their share in the retail market and PPC reduce its own share respectively so that PPC has less than 50% of the Interconnected System by the end of 2019. Profit margins of alternative electricity suppliers are expected to increase due to the introduction of forward products regulated auctions, making them more aggressive in attracting new customers, since they will be able to secure a long term (1 ­ 4 years) low wholesale electricity price. Should the alternative suppliers target the most trustworthy and profitable PPC's clients to develop their business, then PPC will suffer a substantial loss of revenue, profitability and additional cash flow pressures. But the retail market's structure requires a serious analysis and assessment of the customer groups which objectively can be the object of competition and in any case requires the exclusion of SRT and HV customers when calculating PPC's market share. Unless there are reforms in the regulatory framework to ensure the correction of existing distortions in the wholesale market, setting conditions of healthy competition and balanced development of suppliers in the market and promotion of competitive tariffs without cross-subsidization, a further increase in the competition in the supply electricity sector could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly the Group and the Parent Company will be adversely affected if the price of forward products, as will be set within the relevant auctions, does not cover the full cost of electricity generation but only part of these costs. This risk appears particularly high, since the already set starting auction price for auctions is based only on variable cost of lignite and hydroelectric production, and specifically only on the variable costs of lignite mines, so it is uncertain whether the remaining fixed costs can be recovered through auctions (capital costs, salaries, depreciation, etc. of the production units and lignite mines). Finally, if the sale price of forward products, as this will be set within the relevant actions, is less than the System Marginal Price (as the latter is being set from the Day Ahead Schedule), the participating PPC's power plants in forward products (lignite and hydro power units) will undergo significant revenue losses, and as a result the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition, operating results and prospects will be adversely impacted. If the resulting Forward Products Auction prices are substantially below the SMP, which will lead PPC generation to excessive losses, it will constitute a cross subsidization of alternative suppliers, with all that this entails for free competition Indicatively, the final weighted average settlement price of the first six auctions was  37.39/MWh, 41.06/MWh,  39.68/MWh,  43.04/MWh, 45.17/MWh and  41.23/MWh respectively, namely the prices were significantly lower than both the System Marginal Price (monthly fluctuation between  44.6/MWh and  74.6/ MWh for the period December 2016 ­ February 2018, the average price being  55.4/MWh) and PPC's production costs.
Risk Relating to Structural Measures for the Divestment of Lignite-Fired Units
According to the Decision 57/19.05.2017 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy, on "The structural measures for PPC's access to lignite" and in compliance with the decisions C (2008) 824 and C (2009) 6244 of the European Commission on PPC's monopoly access to lignite, which became irreversible after the (2016) 733 and (2016) 748 decisions of the General Court of the European Union, Greece will propose to the Commission's Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp.) binding remedial structural measures based on the following principles:
a. The measures will include PPC's disinvestment of lignite power generating units to existing or new alternative suppliers or other investors.
b. P PC will not have any involvement or connection with any element of disinvestment, including preferential electricity supply. The purchaser(s):
· w ill be independent of and will not have any association with PPC and its affiliated companies,
57

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

· w ill have the financial resources, proven know-how and incentive to maintain and develop the disinvested portfolio of power generating stations as a viable and active competitive power in relation to PPC and other competitors,
· on the basis of the information available, they would not cause or threaten to cause prima facie competition concerns and they would not create a risk of delay in the implementation of the structural measures.
c. T he disinvestment will account for about 40% of PPC's lignite power generating capacity. The exact percentage will be determined during technical discussions with the European Commission in accordance with the abovementioned decisions (the disinvestment will include the associated lignite reserves).
d. The disinvestment will have equivalent economic characteristics to PPC's lignite power generating capacity, particularly in terms of efficiency and life, reflecting the start and end of lignite power generating capacity.
e. The measures will be designed and implemented in accordance with the applicable and substantive competition rules. They will be finalized through the formal submission of the agreed binding proposal by the Hellenic Republic to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition until November 2017 and will be implemented by June 2018.
In this context, in January 2018, the Hellenic Republic proposed to the European Commission's DirectorateGeneral for Competition as a binding structural measure the disinvestment of three (3) existing lignite units of PPC, namely Meliti 1 (330 MW installed capacity), Megalopolis 3 300 MW) and Megalopolis 4 (300 MW), as well as the production license for a new lignite unit (Meliti 2, 450 MW), together with the exploration and exploitation rights of the respective lignite mines (Megalopolis mine for the units Megalopoli 3 and 4 and the mines Kleidi, Meliti hills and Vevi for Meliti). The Directorate-General for Competition conducted a market test for the aforementioned commitment of the Hellenic Republic. In addition, following the above, the Greek Parliament on 25/4/2018 passed the legislative provisions entitled «Structural measures for access to lignite and the further opening of the wholesale electricity market and other provisions», which defines the process of the spin-off and contribution of two (2) lignite sectors of PPC SA in two (2) new companies (one in Meliti and one in Megalopolis), the framework of the international tender procedure for the sale of the shares that PPC SA will take over, the responsibility of PPC SA for the two (2) new companies and, the employment relations of the employees in the two (2) new companies. The above mentioned structural measures may have a significant impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's operation, contractual obligations, liquidity and financial results.
Other Risks relating to Law 4336/14.08.2015
Apart from the above provisions, Law 4336/14.08.2015 introduces provisions for the energy and natural gas market in relation to the following:
· R AE's jurisdiction on monitoring the account of entities operating in the energy and the natural gas sectors as well as the account of the Transmission System and Distribution Network's Operators, ensuring that there will be no cross subsidies between generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity.
· T he obligation of the Authorities to enact regulations concerning the offsetting of debts between PPC and the market operator. They will implement discontinuation contracts as adopted by the European Commission (intermittent load auctions have already been implemented following Ministerial Decision OG B' / 2861 / 2812-2015). The obligation of the Authorities to introduce a new plan for the upgrade of electricity networks, in order to improve performance, enhance interoperability and reduce costs for consumers.
· The action map for the electricity market should be completed by December 2017. In this context, the balancing market should be completed by June 2017. Law 4425/2016 enacted the reorganization of the Greek electricity market, implementing the legislative framework for the integration of the European electricity market and in particular the transition to the European Target Model. Following Law 4425/2016, RAE on December 5th 2016 put into public consultation the Draft Guidelines and Instructions to the competent Market Operators, for the drafting up of those Markets Codes. The balancing market has not been completed by the end of June 2017.
58

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

Moreover, the details of the operation of the individual markets of the Target Model (forward, pre-day, intraday and balancing) have not yet been enacted.
· T he Authorities' obligation, by October 2015, to review energy's taxation as well as to reinforce RAE's financial and operational independence.
· The Authorities' obligation, by December 2015, to approve a new framework for the support of the Renewable Energy Sources, preserving their economic viability; establish a new scheme for the upgrading of the energy Networks and to initiate the implementation of the roadmap for the harmonization of the energy market with the European Target Model by December 2017. By Law 4414/2016 the new framework for the support of RES was enacted in line with the above mentioned provision of Law 4336/2015.
In Addition, by Law 4336/14.08.2015 the Greek State had committed to proceed with the ongoing privatization program. The Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund's (HRADF) BoD has already approved the Asset Development Plan (ADP) which provides for the privatization of assets already held by HRADF by December 31st 2014. With Decision 33/2016 of the Government Counsil for Economic Policy, the Business Plan of HRADF was approved. Currently and since the fourth evaluation of the Greek Republic Funding Program has not yet been completed, it is not possible to accurately assess the potential impact on the Greek economy and on the activities, the operating results, the financial condition and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Company from the application of the provisions of Law. 4336/2015.
Risk from the Absence of Fixed Asset Insurance
Currently, the Group and the Parent Company do not maintain insurance against the usual risks associated with their power plants, distribution assets, property and equipment. Only major information technology equipment is insured. Moreover, materials and spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured. This has been primarily due to the high costs associated with obtaining insurance against these risks compared to the cost for remediating the damage should any of these risks occur, and the dispersed network of power plants. Additionally, the Group does not insure third party liabilities with respect to distribution networks. During construction, major assets (except for networks) are insured by EPC contractors for their construction period. Cash in offices and agencies or in transfer is insured against theft and transports of liquid fuels are also insured. Any severe damage to key power plants, distribution assets or mining equipment could have a significant adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, business interruptions due to labor disputes, strikes, earthquakes, fires, and adverse weather conditions, among other factors, could potentially, depending on their severity and duration, result in a loss of revenues or increased costs for the Group.
Hydrologic Conditions
The evolution of hydrologic conditions is a completely unpredictable factor and has a very significant impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability, taking into account, of course, that PPC has an accumulated experience and expertise that allows managing in the best possible way the water resources in its reservoirs.
Lignite Mining Risks and Availability of Lignite Reserves
Lignite mining is subject to inherent risks and is dependent upon a number of conditions beyond the Group's and the Parent Company's control that can affect costs and production schedules at particular mines. While the Parent Company estimates that lignite reserves are adequate to cover long term levels of supply required for power generation by lignite-fired thermal power plants, such estimates may lack complete precision and depend to some extent on statistical and geological inferences. Furthermore exploitable reserves are not considered as such unless they can be economically and legally extracted. Increased production costs, increased stripping ratios, changes in the regulatory regime governing the Parent Company's mining operations, the adoption of political decisions both by the EU and Greece, contributing to the reduction of the country's carbon footprint and the reduction of the exploitation of fossil fuels to generate electricity, the significant decline in oil prices and consequently natural gas prices and the increase in the price of
59

ANNUAL REPORT 2017

PART B

CO2 emission rights burdening lignite fired electricity plants costs may result from time to time in a revision of reserve data or may render exploitable reserves uneconomical to exploit or unexploitable in the future. Restrictions imposed by national legislation on the Parent Company's ability for new recruitments may result in the future in a shortage of skilled and qualified personnel in mining operations to operate and support its equipment and may adversely affect lignite production through the Parent Company's own resources.
EPC Related Risks
The Group and the Parent Company face risks relating to the construction of electricity generation units, including risks relating to the availability of equipment from reliable suppliers, availability of building materials and key components, availability of key personnel, delays in construction timetables and completion of the projects within budget and to required specifications. They may also encounter various setbacks such as adverse weather conditions, difficulties in connecting to electricity transmission grids, construction defects, delivery failures by suppliers, unexpected delays in obtaining zoning and other permits and authorizations or legal actions brought by third parties. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial or operating problems of main suppliers and contractors especially after the imposition of capital controls, may have an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials, as well as finding sufficiently competitive conditions in the domestic market and have engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contracts completed in a timely manner and may increase the Group's and the Parent Company's operating and maintenance costs as well as planning times.
Risk from Potential Undertaking of Social Security Liabilities
Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group and the Parent Company do not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit whatsoever between income and expenses (deficit) to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
Litigations Risk
The Group and the Parent Company are involved in several legal proceedings arising from their operations, and any adverse outcome against PPC or any other of the Group's companies may have a negative impact on their business, financial condition and reputation. In addition, as a majority state owned utility, the Group is subject to laws, rules and regulations designed to protect the public interest, such as of public procurement or environmental protection. Violation of such legislation, entails, among others, criminal sanctions for the Board of Directors members and executive officers as well as the employees of the companies and utilities that are subject to those rules. Simultaneously, the Group is one of the largest industrial groups in Greece, with complex activities and operations across the country. In the ordinary course of its business, from time to time, competitors, suppliers, customers, owners of property adjacent to the Group's properties, the media, activists, and ordinary citizens, raise complaints (even to public prosecutors) about the Group's operations and activities, to the extent they feel that such activities and operations cause or are likely to cause economic damage to their views and/or interests, businesses or properties and, in the context of advancing those complaints, they often file criminal complaints against the Group. In this context, reports involving complaints and accusations for allegedly unlawful acts of executives against the Group usually involve their further investigation by the Prosecuting Authorities in the so-called preliminary proceedings, which usually ends up in the closing of the investigated case due to lack of conclusive evidence. These practices have intensified during the recent economic crisis, as public prosecutors and the general public have generally become more sensitive to similar allegations, especially against companies in which the Hellenic Republic is a major shareholder and are viewed as operating in the public interest. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company, their Board of Directors members and directors, are at present and could be in the future, subject to various criminal or other investigations at various stages of procedural advancement on a variety of grounds arising in connection with their activities in the ordinary course of business. These investigations and legal proceedings may be disruptive to the Group's and the Parent Company's daily
60

FINANCIAL REPORT

operations to the extent that the officers and directors involved need to spend time and resources in connection therewith. They may also adversely affect the Group's and the Parent Company's reputation, although to date, none of the proceedings initiated against the Group and the Group's officers or directors has resulted in any criminal convictions.
Risk from Tax and Other Regulations The taxation regime for corporations in Greece is frequently revised and the Group may be subject in the future to increased taxation rates. The imposition of any new taxes, or changing interpretations or application of tax regulations by the tax authorities as well as the harmonization of Greek and EU tax law and regulation may result in additional amounts being payable by the Group and the Parent Company, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Parent Company pays a special levy for the development of areas where electricity is generated from lignite, equal to 0.5% of its annual turnover. Since 2012, the Parent Company has been subject to a special levy for lignite generated electricity equal to  2.00 /MWh and a special tax on natural gas which was abolished from June 1st 2016. Currently, the Group does not pay any royalty, concession fee or other fee for lignite extraction or for water used on its hydropower plants. The application of any new royalty regime may require the abolishment of the current regime and the Group cannot guarantee that any form of royalties, concession fees or other fees on its lignite or hydropower production will not be introduced by the Greek Government in the future. Due to the current recession in Greece, even if the effect of any new taxes, levies, etc. is passed onto the Group's and the Parent Company's customers, such taxes, levies, etc. may impact collection rates for PPC's electricity bills or result in a loss of market share due to competition. Conversely, if the Group and the Parent Company do not increase tariffs to match an increase in taxation, an adverse impact on their financial results and liquidity may follow.
The Group and PPC are subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to companies of the broader public sector
As long as the Hellenic Republic, as the major shareholder of PPC, holds 51% of its share capital, the Company shall, in some respects, continue to be considered a public sector company in Greece. Therefore, its operations shall continue to be subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to public sector, affecting thus specific procedures, including but not limited to personnel salaries, maximum level of salaries, recruitments of employees, as well as the procurement policies etc. The said laws and regulations, particularly within the framework of the current financial conjecture and the relevant decisions of the Central Administration, which are not expected to be applicable to the Parent Company's current and future competitors, may limit the Parent Company's operational flexibility and may also have significant negative impact on its financial results, cash flow and on business risk management. It should be noted that the Group did not have for several years (till today) the ability to recruit experienced personnel in the range of its business activities while, today's average personnel age is approximately 49 years. The Group's inability to recruit specialized personnel negatively affects the ability of the new PPC Group to elaborate and implement its strategy in the new competitive and financial environment, as well as to adequately staff basic supportive operations at the level of new subsidiaries. Finally, there is a risk of losing managers and experienced personnel to the competition mainly because of restrictions on remuneration policies. The viability and development of PPC Group in the new business environment notably depend on the ability to attract and maintain skilled and specialized personnel and executives. According to L. 3833/2010 and L. 4057/2012 , concerning the recruiting of permanent staff an approval of the Interministerial Committee is necessary (AIC 33/2006), as well as an allocative act of the Minister of the Interiors and Administrative reorganization according to the 1:4 ratio (a recruitment for every four employees leaving) for the year 2017 and 1:3 for the year 2018 concerning all public sector entities .By the above mentioned and introduced by law hiring procedure, the Parent Company's recruitment needs are significantly hindered, creating critical lack of personnel and managers and may have a negative impact on the implementation of the Groups' activity.

PART B

Organization and Risk Management
The Group has defined risk as an occurrence of uncertain and non-predictable conditions that may negatively affect its overall operations, business activity, financial performance, as well as the execution of its strategy and the achievement of its goals. The Parent Company has established the Risk Management, Planning and Control Department but Risk Management has not been staffed, as a result of the lack of experienced staff due to constraints in hiring, as well as due to other adverse factors mentioned in the previous section. Till today its line management, on a case by case basis, is engaged in identifying and primarily assessing risks in order to submit recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the design and approval of specific risk management procedures and policies. The Group and the Parent Company can provide no assurance that such procedures and policies provide full protection against the risks that they face.
The Group may Face Strikes
Most of the Group's and the Parent Company's employees are members of labour unions. Extensive labour unrest may have a significant negative impact on the Group's business activity.
Health, Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are subject to National as well as European laws and regulations regarding their employees and the subcontractors employees' health and safety as well as environmental issues. The cost for complying with such legislation and regulations may require major investments and/or significant expenses for actions regarding the environmental compliance, upgrade and rehabilitation. Changes in the environmental legislation may increase the compliance cost and eventually, may have an impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability as well as its cash flow program, although compliance cost for health and safety rules is relatively low. Furthermore, due to the nature of their operations, the Group and the Parent Company are involved in a number of environmental proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may not involve financial penalties and therefore cannot be quantified. The Group is also involved in court cases raised from victims of serious work-related accidents or from the families of deceased persons. Future related costs as a result of enforcement actions and/or third party claims for environmental damage and/or insurance cost for environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations and financial position. The Group and the Parent Company are also required to obtain environmental and safety permits for their operations from various governmental authorities. Certain permits require periodic renewal or review of their environmental terms as well as continuous monitoring and reporting of compliance with such terms. The Group and the Parent Company cannot give any assurance that they will be able to renew environmental permits or that material changes to their permits requiring significant expenditures on its end will not be imposed. Environmental, health and safety laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may not at all times be in full compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, as an owner and operator of generation and distribution facilities, the Group and the Parent Company may incur in the future costs and expenses in connection with the decommissioning of such facilities, which the Group and the Parent Company estimate to be to a large extent recoverable from the sale of decommissioned equipment, materials and scrap.
Information Technology (IT) Security A large portion of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations are based on information systems; therefore they are exposed to the risk of non-availability, data integrity corruption and unauthorized access to these systems. In order to minimize these risks, the Group and the Parent Company take measures for the enhancement of their IT security.
62

PART B

FINANCIAL REPORT

The Group and the Parent Company believe that they currently have adequate security policies in place to cover risks associated with the operation and maintenance of their IT infrastructure and perform regular audits of their systems. However, there can be no assurances that they will be able to prevent technology failures or IT security breaches in a timely manner or continue to have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for related losses (including litigation claims, liability and data loss), which could disrupt their operations or harm their reputation and have a materially adverse effect on their business.
Extraordinary Events
Unexpected events, including natural disasters, fires, war, terrorist activities, strikes, etc., may lead to a breakdown or the interruption of the operation of the Group's and the Parent Company's mines, the generation function and electricity transmission and distribution. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial and operating problems of basic suppliers, service providers and contractors may have a negative impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials and may increase their operating costs. The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are susceptible to industrial accidents, and employees or third parties may suffer bodily injury or death as a result of such accidents. In particular, while the Group and the Parent Company believe that their equipment has been well designed and manufactured and is subject to rigorous quality control tests, quality assurance tests, and is in compliance with applicable health and safety standards and regulation, the design and manufacturing process is ultimately controlled by their equipment suppliers or manufacturers or EPC contractors rather than by the them, and there can be no assurance that accidents will not result during the installation or operation of this equipment. Furthermore, the consequences of these events may create significant and long-lasting environmental or health hazards and pollution and may be harmful or a nuisance to neighboring residents. The Group and the Parent Company may be required to pay damages or fines, clean up environmental damage or dismantle power plants in order to comply with environmental or health and safety regulations. The Group and the Parent Company may also face civil liabilities or fines in the ordinary course of their business as a result of damages to third parties caused by the natural and man-made disasters mentioned above. These liabilities may result in the Group and the Parent Company being required to make indemnification payments in accordance with applicable laws.
Licensing Risk
The procedures for obtaining and renewing authorizations and permits for the Group's and the Parent Company's activities can be protracted and complex. Obtaining these authorizations is not routine and the conditions attached to obtaining them are subject to change and may not be predictable. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may incur significant expenses in order to comply with the requirements associated with obtaining or renewing these authorizations. Failure to obtain or renew the necessary licenses and permits might result in interruptions to some of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including also the ability to obtain funding for their activities. Any failure to obtain, maintain, renew or extend all the administrative authorizations and licenses necessary for the operation of their business and execution of their strategy, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, strategic and financial planning, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Risk from Impairment of Assets
In relation to the value of their participation in the share capital of subsidiaries and associates and the value of their tangible assets, the Group and the Parent Company are exposed to the following risks:
·T he risk from a significant change or/and the non-recoverability of the value of the Parent's Company, participation in the share capital of subsidiaries and associates.
·T he risk from a significant change in the fair value of their tangible assets in the context of their periodic reassessment.

encapsulating the intention of the Management to enhance the communication of its approach to all of its stakeholders. The Code of Corporate Governance provides a framework of principles and procedures that the Corporate Governance System of the Corporation follows as regards management, shareholders, its Internal Audit System and risk management. The Internal Audit Department, in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, inter alia, controls, evaluates and submits proposals regarding the Company's exposure to the risk of fraud and on the existing methods of fraud detection and prevention. In 2017, according to the PPC CEO's decision No. 147/2017, the position of Director of Regulatory Compliance was established. Its responsibilities include, among others, the following:
·E stablishment of communication procedures for Regulatory Compliance and Business Code of Conduct issues, and management of an appropriate whistleblowing channel and non-compliance reported incidents in general.
·D etermining the training needs and in collaboration with the Training Department, develop the training programs ensuring that employees are always informed and trained on the Regulatory Compliance and Business Code of Conduct issues.
The Staff Regulations of PPC (SR/ PPC) regulates, inter alia, the rights and obligations of employees, the terms of employment contracts, the relationships formed in the execution of work and the exercise of disciplinary power. PPC implements a Training Management System for identifying and analyzing training needs, designing training courses, selecting trainees and instructors, running training courses, and evaluating training activities (the training cycle). Furthermore, PPC has developed quality, health and safety, and environmental management systems, which have been certified respectively according to ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001, aiming at its optimal operation.
Case Study: Suppliers' and Contractors' Management
PPC signs contracts when purchasing materials and services to meet its needs and to carry out engineering works. Where possible, the Corporation makes agreements with local suppliers, contributing significantly to the development of the local economies. PPC's procurement procedures are governed by Law 4412/2016 (Government Gazette 147/A). The Corporation posts tenders notices for works and supplies on its website, to encourage public dialogue in a totally transparent and objective manner. The key procurement categories include materials and spare parts, support equipment, services, projects, liquid fuels, lignite (from third parties), natural gas, and the purchase of electricity and GHG (CO2) trading allowances. To ensure contractors and any subcontractors comply with labour and insurance law for their own staff, PPC includes a general clause in all contracts it signs according to which the contract may be terminated and the contractor may be excluded from future tender procedures in case of recurrent non-compliance. When paying contractors, PPC requests proof that the contractor has complied with its obligations to its staff and paid its employer social security contributions. In doing so the Corporation ensures that it cooperates with contractors who adhere to labour law and have their staff insured in the manner specified by law. To ensure the health and safety of the staff of PPC's contractors, those contractors are responsible for implementing occupational health and safety legislation and are subject to the legal sanctions involved. Contractors expressly undertake exclusive responsibility for designing and implementing safe working practices for persons employed on Project construction and for third parties.

PART B

Contractors/subcontractors are obliged to provide staff with suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) depending on the work being carried out, to take all health and safety at work measures required by law and to comply with the obligations for a safety engineer and occupational physician, to assess and prevent occupational risk, to protect against harmful agents and to keep employees informed about these issues. Upon entering the worksite, contractors are obliged to provide the Corporation with a list of staff to be employed (number, area of specialisation) as well as all other information which the Corporation considers necessary about such staff. If the Corporation considers this necessary, the contractor's staff must undergo training relevant to specialised technical work tasks which are to be undertaken. That training is provided at the PPC Vocational Training Centre. PPC inspects contractor work crews and examines: The PPE, the group protective equipment and tools, to check that they are adequate, what condition they are in and whether the contractor's staff are using them. Whether the contractor's staff hold the necessary licenses and permits. Whether the provisions of contracts and the PPC CEO's decision No. 96/2010 are being implemented, to ensure that PPC's contractors implement labour and social security law.

PPC monitors international trends on how sustainable development is being managed and strives to improve its own performance, to ensure greater transparency in procedures and to ensure accountability. With that in mind, given that the heart of revisions to the GRI Guidelines is that each company must identify and evaluate its material aspects, in December 2016 the Corporation's divisions, Legal Services and the Strategy Department carried out a sustainability materiality analysis for the third time.
Material aspects identified by Management
PPC has developed a sustainability materiality analysis process as part of its risk identification and assessment process. However, here it does not identify operational or financial risks, but sustainability risks / impacts. The materiality heatmaps emerged from this process show the estimated impacts/risks together with the likelihood of them occurring. The heatmaps, the findings and conclusions derived from them and the dynamic tool used to formulate and process the results of this process were then evaluated by the Corporation's Management team to devise policies and take decisions.
Material aspects identified by stakeholders
PPC acknowledges that its business operations and decision affect and are affected by different groups of stakeholders. PPC contacted its stakeholders using an online questionnaire, asking them to evaluate/score what were in their opinion the PPC's sustainability material aspects. After a period of around 1 month when the questionnaire was open, PPC had collected 1,034 responses from all stakeholder groups from all regions of Greece.
Presentation of the material aspects
The results presented in the following diagram illustrate the issues identified in the period 2016-2017.

PPC's approach to material aspects
Material aspect: 1. Financial position/performance PPC's financial performance was indicated as a material aspect primarily by Management, shareholders and

investors, employees and competitors. It is a key priority for Management. The Corporation's financial data is available in the 2017 Annual Report.
Material aspect: 2. Procurement and logistics management
Both PPC's management team and employees have recognised procurement and logistics management as a material aspect; a reflection of the added interest in developing transparent, effective relationships and partnerships with the Corporation's suppliers and contractors. PPC complies with Law 4412/2016 on procurement and attaches particular importance to labour and health and safety issues in its contracts with contractors.
Material aspect: 3. New markets and investments
Both PPC and stakeholders have identified and agreed that key material aspects for the Corporation's sustainable development are the investments made and expansion into new markets. Generally speaking, PPC's strategic goal (which it is working intensively on) is to offset domestic losses due to the market liberalisation measures imposed on it, by expanding into fresh markets and capitalising on business partnerships.
Material aspect: 4. Regulatory issues
Management and Company competitors have recognised PPC's involvement in managing regulatory issues as a material aspect of its operations. Further market deregulation has created uncertainties and challenges for PPC, and the Corporation considers that the need to generate results when it comes to regulatory issues will intensify.
Material aspect: 5. Risk/crisis management
Risk/crisis management was primarily selected as a material aspect by Company Management, employees, customers, associates and suppliers, the State, regulatory authorities and public agencies, and by nongovernmental/ non-profit organisations. PPC's Management has made concerted efforts to recognise, prevent and manage risks and crises in good time. PPC's Board of Directors then examines the key risks PPC faces and refers to them in detail in the Board of Directors' Annual Financial Report.
Material aspect: 7. Managing new energy market issues
Management and employees at PPC identify managing new energy market conditions as a material aspect. Rapid developments in the energy market in Greece, coupled with the country's commitments under the MoUs which are bringing about changes in Greece's energy landscape, have made Management and employees more interested in the role the Corporation will play in the emerging energy and economic environment. PPC's goal continues to be to ensure a competitive environment, where the key concern is benefit for customers.
Material aspect: 8. Corporate governance, ethics and values
Corporate governance, ethics and values have been recognised as material aspects by Management and the corporation's very own employees, customers, associates and suppliers, non-Governmental/Non-Profit Organisations, by the State, regulatory authorities and by public agencies. With the Board of Directors' approval PPC implements a Code of Corporate Governance which sets out the corporate Governance framework and guidelines.
Material aspect: 13. Staffing the Corporation
Staffing the Corporation was indicated as a material aspect primarily by Management, shareholders and investors, employees and competitors. An ageing staff coupled with restrictions on new recruitments because of legal provisions applicable to companies in the Greek public sector, are aspects of this topic which directly impact on the Corporation's operations.
Material aspect: 20. Involvement in public policy on energy issues in Greece
PPC's involvement in Greece's public policy on energy issues is recognised as a material aspect by the Corporation's Management team and employees, and by the State, regulatory authorities and public agencies. PPC is actively involved in shaping public policy, expressing its views on a range of issues relating to its operation, and more generally the modernisation of the domestic electricity market.

FINANCIAL REPORT

Material aspect: 24. Climate change and greenhouse gas/particle emissions
Climate change is a global environmental problem, whose impacts affect all aspects of human life (the environment, health, the food chain, infrastructure, the economy and politics). According to the 5th IPCC assessment report, it is extremely likely that man-made GHG emissions (CO2, methane, nitrogen oxide and fluoride gases) are the main cause of climate change. When generating electricity from fossil fuels, GHGs and atmospheric pollutants are released into the air. In this regard, climate change and gas / particle emissions have been recognised as material matters by the Corporation's Management team, customers, associates and suppliers, the State, regulatory authorities and public agencies, regions, local government authorities and local communities, as well as by nongovernmental and non-profit organisations. Keeping the rise in the average global temperature sufficiently below 2oC and the attempt to bring it even lower, to 1.5oC compared to pre-industrial age levels (targets which were agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris) require measures to be taken to curtail GHGs in the power generation sector.
Material aspects: 32. Energy efficiency/new technologies and 33. Promotion of renewable energy sources
Investments in new technologies to improve energy efficiency, and promotion of renewable energy sources are aspects which are deemed material by Company management as well as by all stakeholders. Improving energy efficiency makes a positive contribution to the Company's financial results, while further promoting RES reduces the Corporation's exposure to fluctuations in carbon prices in the EU's ETS. At the same time PPC recognises its own responsibility for GHG emissions resulting from its operations and helps effectively limit such emissions and thereby combat climate change.

Statement of Corporate Governance
1. INTRODUCTION
1. Code of Corporate Governance applying to the Company
Corporate Governance is a system of principles, based on which the optimal organization, administration and operation of a société anonyme, as well as the transparency in its relations with the shareholders and the safeguarding in general of corporate interests are pursued.
The observance of the principles of corporate governance constitutes an essential commitment and priority of "Public Power Corporation S.A." (herein PPC S.A. or the Company) due to its important role in the Greek economy, and the public interest services it provides.
It is to be noted that the Company is governed by specific laws and regulations applicable to the corporations of the wider public sector, as long as the Hellenic Republic, as the main shareholder, holds 51% of its share capital. Consequently, its operations shall continue to be subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the companies of the Greek public sector affecting specific procedures, as those concerning, indicatively but not limited to, personnel remuneration policy. The said laws and regulations, to which the current competitors of the Company are not expected to be subject, are likely to limit its operational flexibility and the implementation of the relevant "best practices" of corporate governance.
Specifically, the Hellenic Republic holds directly and indirectly, through the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED1), 51.12% of PPC S.A. common registered shares. TAIPED holds 17% of the Company's share capital, which is included in the aforementioned percentage held by the Hellenic Republic, since TAIPED is 100% owned by the Hellenic Republic. In accordance with the Act of Legislative Content dated 7.9.2012, which was ratified by article 2 of Law 4092/2012 (OG A' 220/8.11.2012), the obligatory participation of the Hellenic Republic by at least 51% in the share capital was abolished and the Company's Articles of Incorporation were adapted accordingly.
PPC prepares the current statement of Corporate Governance pursuant to the provisions of Article 43bb of Codified Law 2190/1920, as added with Article 2 of L. 4403/2016 (OG A' 125/07.07.2016) as applicable and appropriate, in accordance with the International Accounting Standards which have been established under the Regulation (EC)1606/2002.
PPC has drawn up and implements its own Code of Corporate Governance. Said Code was updated in February 2018 and is posted on the Company's website (www.dei.gr).
The main axes of the Code of Corporate Governance implemented by PPC are the following:
Administration Composition of the Governing Bodies, jurisdiction and functioning. Committees of the Board of Directors (herein BoD) and jurisdiction thereof.
Shareholders Jurisdiction and operation of the General Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders' rights, briefing of the shareholders, as well as reference to the information data required pursuant to article 10 par. 1 of Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament, as incorporated in Law 3461/2006.
Internal audit and risk management Main characteristics of the Company's internal audit and risk management systems, regarding the procedure of preparing its financial statements.
1. T AIPED or HRADF is a Societé Anonyme under the name "HELLENIC REPUBLIC ASSET DEVELOPMENT FUND S.A." which was established by Law 3986/2011 (O.G. A' 152/2011) as amended and in effect.

Members of the Board as well as any third person to whom any competencies of the Board have been assigned, are required to disclose promptly and adequately to the rest of the Board Members their own interests, that may arise from any transactions of the Company which fall within the scope of their duties, as well as any conflict of own interests with those of the Company or of any associated company, which may arise during the performance of their duties. In the event that such conflict of interests is reported or occurs in accordance with the aforementioned, such Member of the Board shall have no voting right during the relevant meeting of the Board. Any vote cast by such Member of the Board shall not be counted toward a quorum and majority.

APENDIX Definitions and reconciliations of Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs")
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ("APMs")
The Group and the Parent Company using Alternative Performance Measures ( «APMs») in taking decisions concerning the financial, operational and strategic planning, as well as for the evaluation and publication of their performance. These APMs serve to better understand the financial and operating results of the Group and the Parent Company, their financial position and cash flows. Alternative indicators (APMs) should always be read in conjunction with the financial results that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and in no way replace them.
Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs")
In discussing the Group's and the Parent Company's performance, "adjusted" measures are used such as: Adjusted EBITDA without one off effects and Adjusted EBITDA margin without one off effects. These adjusted measures are calculated by deducting from performance measures directly derived from amounts of the annual Financial Statement the effect and costs arising from events which have occurred during the reporting period and which have not affected the amounts of previous periods.
EBITDA (Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses and taxes)
EBITDA serves to better analyze the operating results of the Group and the Parent Company and is calculated as follows: Total turnover minus total operating expenses before depreciation and impairment. The EBITDA margin (%) is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total turnover. Calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin is presented in the following table:

Net Debt
Net debt is an APM that Management uses to evaluate the capital structure of the Group and the Parent Company as well as leverage. Net debt is calculated by adding long-term loans, the current portion of long term loans and short term loans and subtracting from the total, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and financial assets available for sale and adding the unamortized portion of borrowing costs (see. Note. 28 annual Financial Statements). Calculation of Net Debt is presented in the following table:

Independent Auditor's Report To the Shareholders of "Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC)"
Report on the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of "Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC)" (the Company), which comprise the separate and consolidated balance sheet as at 31st of December 2017, the separate and consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of "Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC)" and its subsidiaries (the Group) as at 31st of December 2017, and their financial performance and their consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as incorporated into the Greek Legislation. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the separate and consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report. We are independent of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries throughout our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated into the Greek Legislation and the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the requirements of the current legislation and the above-mentioned IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to note 36 to the financial statements, which describes the matter of adjustments of the previous years' items, according to the provisions of IAS 8, in which is referred among other: a) the retrospective restatement of the deferred tax assets, the income tax in the statements of income and the group's equity for the period ended 31st of December 2016 and for the first six-months of the year 2017, which concern error in previous periods calculation on the deferred tax assets for the obligation to supply electric power at a reduced tariff in the periods under restatement and b) the retrospective restatement of receivables of disposed but non invoiced power, trade receivables and deferred tax liabilities as at 31st of December 2015 and 2016 and the sixmonth periods ended 30th of June 2016 and 2017 as well as the revenue and the results per share of the years then ended and concern error of previous periods on the estimation of revenue from low voltage customers for the periods under restatement. The above corrections had no cash effect. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters and the related risks of material misstatement were addressed in the context of our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Correct Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)

KEY AUDIT MATTER

ADDRESSING THE AUDIT MATTER

At 31.12.2017, the Group has recognised PPE assets amounting  11,57 billion.
Given the significance of the value of the above PPE assets and the use of management's assumptions and estimates for the determination of the recoverable amounts, we consider the assessment of the valuation of the above assets as one of most significance area.
The disclosures regarding the accounting policy, the assumptions and estimates used and the analysis of these assets are included in notes 3.3, 3.4 and 14 to the financial statements.

Our audit approach included, among other, the following procedures:
· W e assessed the Management's procedures for the identification of any material changes in the fair value of the PPE assets.
· We received and assessed the Management's estimate about the existence or non-existence of material changes in the fair value of the PPE assets.
· Also, we assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the related disclosures in the notes 3.3, 3.4 and 14 to the financial statements.

Inventories

KEY AUDIT MATTER

ADDRESSING THE AUDIT MATTER

At 31.12.2017, the Group's inventory value amounts to  731,4 million and  832 million respectively in the previous year.
As described in notes 3.4 and 19 to the financial statements, inventories include consumables, spare parts, lignite and liquid fuel inventories. Inventory items are measured at the per kind lower of cost and net realizable value, which is determined by reference to the price of the final product in which these are embedded. The acquisition cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
The production/purchase cost comprises mainly all costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition of consumption.
In 2017 the Group recognised additional impairment losses for the value of materials and spare parts amounting  8,5 million.
We consider the assessment of the valuation of the Company's inventories to be one of most significance matter, on the one hand because of the amount and the nature of inventories and secondly because of the Management's critical estimates and judgments for the determination of their net realizable value.

We assessed the reasonableness of the Management's assumptions used for the inventories valuation including:
· U nderstanding the procedures and internal control for inventory management designed by Management.
· M onitoring the physical inventory at the warehouses of the greatest audit interest, in conjunction with the assessment of the findings of the inventory report for 2016 that was made available to us.
· E xamining a sample of materials for confirmation of the correct calculation of the acquisition cost of inventories according to the purchase invoices and the correct allocation of purchase costs.
· E xamining the valuation of classified materials based on a percentage on the price of the respective new material.
· Examining the warehouse trial balance with the use of data analysis software for identifying idle and slowmoving inventories.
· Also, we assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures in note 19 to the financial statements.

Recoverability of trade receivables

KEY AUDIT MATTER

ADDRESSING THE AUDIT MATTER

At 31.12.2017, the Group's trade receivables amount to  4,63 billion while the related accumulated impairment amounts to  2,85 billion, as referred to in note 20 to the financial statements.
The balances of high voltage customers concern large industries and customers abroad. Medium voltage customers concern mainly industrial and commercial companies. Low voltage customers are mainly customers of domestic use and small commercial companies.
The parent company recognizes impairment loss for receivables on specific customer balances.
Due to the significance of the matter and the level of judgment and the estimates required, we consider this to be one of most significance matter.

Our audit approach included, among other, also the following procedures:
· We understood the Group's process with respect to monitoring the trade receivables and the factors taken into account for the estimate of the assumptions and the methodology used for the determination of the recoverability of its trade receivables or their classification as doubtful.
· We received third party confirmation letters for a representative sample of trade receivables and we also carried out alternative procedures, which consist of the review of collection of trade receivables against the yearend balances.
· E xamining the maturity of trade receivable year-end balances and identification of any debtors in financial difficulty.
· D iscussion with Management and examining the recent correspondence with its customers.
· W e carried out recalculation of the impairment of trade receivables taking into account specific parameters for debtors, such as the maturity of balances, large debtors and high-risk debtors.
· W e assessed the customers' aging analysis.
· W e assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 20 to the financial statements.

Revenue recognition

KEY AUDIT MATTER

ADDRESSING THE AUDIT MATTER

The revenue of the Group derives from diversified activity sectors. Revenue recognition has been determined as an audit area of particular interest since it involves complexity associated with the volume of the transactions, the use of IT systems as well as the management's estimates and judgments containing a degree of uncertainty.
In particular, the revenue associated with the retail sale of electric power is determined using IT systems and includes judgments and calculations in areas such as the consumed but not invoice power.
The disclosures regarding the accounting policy, the judgments and estimates used for the revenue are included in the notes 3.3, 3.4 and 4 to the financial statements.

Our main audit approach included, among other the following procedures:
· W e assessed the IT system environment that supports the significant categories of revenue, including the internal procedures and control associated with them.
· W e assessed the correct data transfer from the separate IT systems to the general accounting trial balance.
· W e assessed the assumptions for the recognition of non invoiced revenue at the end of the year ended 31st of December 2017.
· In the above procedures, where deemed necessary, was used a professional IT system auditor.
· W e assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures included in the notes 3.3, 3.4 and 4 to the financial statements.

Other Matter
The separate and consolidate financial statements of the Company for the year ended on December 31st, 2016, were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on April 7th, 2017.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Board of Directors' Report for which reference is made to the "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements", to the Statements of the Members of the Board of Directors, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee (art. 44 L. 4449/2017) of the Company is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated into the Greek Legislation, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as incorporated into the Greek Legislation, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
116

part b

financial report

a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· O btain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
· E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· C onclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company and of its subsidiaries audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

NOTES  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2017
1. Corporate Information
Public Power Corporation S.A. ("PPC" or the "Parent Company") was established in 1950 in Greece for an unlimited duration as a State owned and managed corporation for electricity generation, transmission and distribution throughout Greece. In 1999, the Hellenic Republic enacted Law 2773/1999 ("the Liberalization Law"), which provided for, among other provisions, the transformation of PPC into a société anonyme. PPC's transformation to a société anonyme was effected on January 1, 2001, by virtue of Presidential Decree 333/2000 and its duration was set for 100 years. Effective December 2001, PPC's shares are listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. It is noted that, from November 29th 2017 at the request of the Parent Company, the deletion of the Company's Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and the cessation of their trading on the London Stock Exchange took place. In 2007 the Parent Company proceeded to the spin - off of its RES activity and its contribution to its wholly owned subsidiary PPC Renewables S.A. On December 1st 2011, the Parent Company proceeded to the spin ­ off of its General Division of Transmission and the contribution to its wholly owned subsidiary "Independent Power Transmission Operator" (IPTO S.A.). On June 15th 2017, the Parent Company lost control of the subsidiary IPTO SA while on June 20th 2017 the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA was completed as provided for in articles 142 et seq. Of Law 4389/2016. On May 1st 2012 the spin ­off of the General Division of Distribution was completed by its contribution to PPC's wholly owned subsidiary "Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator" (HEDNO S.A.). The accompanying financial statements include the separate financial statements of PPC and the consolidated financial statements of PPC and its subsidiaries ("the Group"). PPC headquarters are located at 30, Chalkokondili Street, Athens, 104 32 Greece. At December 31st 2017, the number of staff employed by the Group was 17,519 (2016: 18,902 including 1,395 employees of IPTO SA). At December 31st 2017, 89 employees of the Group (2016: 97 including 5 employees of IPTO SA), have been transferred to several State agencies (ministries, organizations, etc.), out of which, 88 were compensated by PPC (2016: 92 including 4 employees of IPTO SA). The total payroll cost of such employees, for the twelve month period ended on December 31st 2017 amounted to  3,527 (2016:  3,460 including  144 relating to IPTO SA). Additionally, PPC's transferred employees in EFKA (Greek Single Social Security Institution) amounted to 245 on December 31st 2017, for which payroll amounted to  10,117. PPC Group generates electricity in its own 61 power generating stations of the Parent Company and from the additional stations which belong to its wholly owned subsidiary PPC Renewables and distributes electricity to consumers through its own distribution lines for Medium and Low voltage of 238,219 kilometres which are managed by its wholly owned subsidiary "Hellenic Distribution Network Operator (HEDNO S.A.)". PPC Group has also constructed a 989 kilometres Network of High Voltage lines pertaining to Distribution facilities and approximately 164 kilometres of urban fibre optics network. Lignite consumed by the Parent Company's lignite-fired power stations is extracted, mainly, from its own lignite mines.
2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
CHANGES IN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET 2017
General Provisions for the Domestic Electricity Market
· According to the Decision 33 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (OG B' 1472/25.05.2016) the HRADF's Asset Development Plan (ADP) was approved. Specifically, for PPC, the potential sale of 17%
137

annual report 2017

part b

of its shares is included in the Asset Development Plan (ADP). According to Law 4425/2016, the transfer of 34% of PPC's shares which the Greek State owns, to the Public Holding Company under establishment is provided. Pursuant to Article 380 of Law 4512/2018 (O.G. A 5/17.01.2018), amendments were made to Law 4389/2016 concerning the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP S.A.) and the retroactive from January 1st 2018 automatic transfer of shares, among others PPC's is provided, together with the obligation of the Management of HCAP S.A. to proceed with any action for the registration of the relevant share transfer in the Dematerialized Securities System of the Athens Stock Exchange (Articles 1 & 2 of Law 4389/2016) (Note 41).
· Law 4389/2016 ("Urgent Provisions for the implementation of the Financial Targets and Structural Reforms Agreement and other provisions") provides, among others, the following:
· T he procedures and details of the full ownership unbundling of IPTO from PPC S.A. are set (articles 142149 and 152). According to the specific articles, PPC must:
(a) Sell, through an international tender (Invitation to Submit an Expression of Interest), at least 20% of IPTO's shares to a strategic investor which will be either (a) a Transmission System Operator, member of the ENTSO-E, or a Transmission System Operator participating in a Transmission System Operator being a member of ENTSO-E or (b) a consortium in which a Transmission System Operator of case (a) will be participating.
(b) Establish a holding company, to which it will transfer in kind 51% of IPTO's Shares. PPC will be initially the sole shareholder of that company and later on PPC will transfer all shares of the company to its shareholders, through a share capital decrease and a distribution in kind.
(c) Sell at least 25% of IPTO's shares in a Greek public company (named Public Holding Company ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. ­ P.H.C ADMIE (IPTO) S.A.). The price per share for that sale will be equal to the price to be paid by the strategic investor as above.
Following the amendment of Law 4389/2016, by Law 4447/2016, the share price was deemed to be determined after the valuation of 25% of the share capital of IPTO as an independent total. The valuation will be carried out by an independent valuator, which will be jointly selected by P.H.C. ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. and PPC S.A. The Share Purchase Agreement («SPA») should have been concluded by February 28th 2017, following the earlier transfer of PPC's shares held in the Holding Company to its shareholders, while according to Law 4393/2016 the deadline for selecting the Preferred Strategic Investor was shortened by one month and should have been be concluded until October 31st 2016. In compliance with Law 4389/2016, the Invitation to Submit an Expression of Interest was issued and published following the July 11th 2016 decision of the General Meeting of PPC S.A. Shareholders, which set and the percentage of sale of IPTO's shares to a strategic investor to 24%. China State Grid International Development Ltd was selected as the Preferred Strategic Investor offering a bid of  320 mil. The sale of 24% of IPTO's shares to the preferred investor was approved by PPC's Shareholders General Meeting on November 24th 2016, while the SPA was signed on December 16th 2016. On January 17th 2017, the PPC's Shareholders General Meeting approved (a) the establishment of a 100% subsidiary company under the name "Holding Company ENERGIAKI S.A. - (EN.SYM)", b) the contribution in kind of the 51% of IPTO's shares held by PPC to EN.SYM as the initial share capital plus  70 in cash and c) the reduction of PPC's share capital by an amount equivalent to the initial share capital of EN.SYM and the distribution in kind of the shares of EN.SYM to existing shareholders of PPC at their proportionate interest in the share capital of PPC. Furthermore, with a subsequent amendment of Law 4389/2016 by Law 4467/2017, it was stipulated that immediately after PPC's carve out to its shareholders of the shares that it holds in ADMIE (IPTO) Holding S.A. (former Holding Company ENERGIAKI S.A.), P.H.C. ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. will acquire all the
138

financial report

Shares of ADMIE (IPTO) Holding S.A. to be held by the Greek State and HRADF. In May 2017, PPC's General Shareholders Meeting approved the transfer of 25% of the share capital of IPTO to P.H.C. ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. for a price determined by an independent valuator ( 295.6 million) as well as the Share Purchase Agreement - SPA which was signed. The aforementioned corporate actions were completed within the stipulated timeframes, while the introduction of ADMIE (IPTO) Holding S.A. in the main securities market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX) was carried out. More specifically, on June 15th 2017 PPC's shares were traded without the right to return in kind to the shareholders of PPC of the shares of ADMIE (IPTO) HOLDING S.A. (51% of the share capital of IPTO S.A.), while on June 20th 2017, the transfer of the 25% and 24% of the share capital of IPTO to P.H.C. ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. and to the Strategic Investor (State Grid Europe Limited) respectively was completed.
· According to the Decision 35 (OG B' 1473/25.5.2016) of the Government's Council for Economic Policy for the introduction of forward electricity products, the annual quantity of electricity for the future products to be auctioned in 2017 will amount to 681 MWh/h (Volume: 5,966,056 MWh) (RAE Decision 619/2016). The allocation of that annual quantity in individual future products with physical delivery will be effected through four auctions, as follows: 145 MWh/h on January 31st 2017, 145 MWh/h on April 26th 2017, 145 MWh/h on July 19th 2017 (According to an announcement by EMO) and 246 MWh/h on October 18th 2017. By RAE's Decision 817/2017 the forward product to be auctioned at the last auction of 2017 was increased to 718 MW. Within 2017 four (4) auctions have been completed for a total 1,153 MW, with the product price ranging between 37.37/MWh and 45.25/MWh. with the mid-price being at 43.70/MWh. Up to this date and during the mechanism's implementation, a significant variation between the total quantity of use declarations and load declarations, especially in low load hours was observed and therefore RAE made regulatory interventions (Amendment of the relevant Code of Transactions) to ensure the proper use of those products, as base products, discouraging the submission of extremely high declarations covering peak loads, to increase the secondary market liquidity and to further strengthen the usage purpose of the forward products (RAE Decision 184/2017).
· L aw 4472/2017 was passed, amending the provisions of L. 4389/2016 concerning:
a) Arrangements for the establishment of an Electricity Sale Mechanism by PPC, pursuant to auctions of forward electricity products with physical delivery and
b) arrangements for the implementation of the full ownership unbundling of IPTO S.A., pursuant to Directive 2009/72/EC.
In particular, the following amendments are introduced:
a) The annual rates of decrease of PPC's share in the retail market of the interconnected system, until the year 2019 in relation to its share in August 2015 shall be as follows:
· For the year 2016: Eight percentage points (8%), with PPC's share standing at 87.24%.
· F or the year 2017: Twelve percentage points (12%), with PPC's share standing at 75.24%.
· F or the year 2018: Thirteen percentage points (13%), with PPC's share standing at 62.24%.
· For the year 2019: Thirteen percentage points (13%), with PPC's share standing at 49.24%.
b) The annual quantity of electricity that will be auctioned per year will be equal with the following percentages on the total electricity quantity for the Interconnected System of the previous year:
· For the year 2016: Eight percentage points (8%).
· For the year 2017 : Sixteen percentage points (16%). Physical deliveries of four percentage points (4%) from the quantity for the year 2017 will begin on December 1st 2017.
· F or the year 2018 : Nineteen percentage points (19%). Physical deliveries of six percentage points (6%) from the quantity for the year 2018 will begin on December 1st 2018.
139

annual report 2017

part b

· F or the year 2019 : Twenty two percentage points (22%). Physical deliveries of nine percentage points (9%) from the quantity for the year 2019 will begin on December 1st 2019.
The aforementioned were approved with Decision 58 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (OG B' 1690/16.05.2017), which includes the updated Implementation Plan for NOME Auctions which was updated subsequently by Decision 68 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (O.G. B 2276/4.7.2017 Amendment of the draft of NOME tender procedures). The mechanism to be applied in the first sub-period will be a Special Purpose Regulated Mechanism, with the annual quantities of electricity auctioned to be equal to the above-mentioned percentages multiplied by the total quantity of electricity for the interconnected system of the previous year. The joint ministerial decision setting the minimum price of the forward products to be auctioned (starting auction price) will be reviewed in June of each year, taking into account the published financial statements of PPC SA. for the previous year and the revised cost of CO2 emission rights prevailing in December of the previous year. It is noted that PPC's market share reduction target until 2019 remain unchanged. Concerning the methodology for determining the quantity for the forward electricity products, to be auctioned, RAE's Impact Report on the six ­ month implementation of NOME Auctions to be published on July 2017 will be taken into account. In the event that the decrease of PPC's retail market share in the Interconnected System falls short of at least two (2) percentage points of the reduction target for the corresponding semester, as determined by the aportionment of the annual target in the corresponding semesters, RAE will increase the quantities to be auctioned for the first (and not the third, as was applicable) six month - period after the end of the six month reference period, by an equivalent increase in the quantities to be auctioned during that six-month period. At the same time, an additional Joint SemiAnnual Impact Report issued by the Greek Authorities and the Institutions is introduced in December 2017 and every six months thereafter, which, taking into account the introduction of the Target Model in the electricity market and the full implementation of structural measures for lignite, will evaluate (a) a possible adjustment of the NOME mechanism, including the modification of forward electricity product quantities to be auctioned after the implementation of structural measures for lignite, and (b) the possible need to adopt additional structural measures in line with the characteristics of PPC's power generating stations portfolio. Following the above, based on the Joint Ministerial Decision //1/.178634 (Official Gazette B2278/04.07.2017), the resulting minimum bid price for the auctioned forward electricity products (starting price) for June 2017 is set to thirty-two euros and five cents per MWh (32.05 /MWh) (compared to 37.37 /MWh set in O.G. B2848/07.09.2016). Taking into account the fact that in the determination of the starting bid-price substantial variable and fixed costs are omitted and consequently PPC suffers significant financial loss, the Parent Company filed before the State Counsil a request for the annulment of this Decision. Also, based on Decision 68 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy, PPC's prepayment rate which is paid after the primary auction, was set at 3% on the valuation of the distributed product.
· With Decision No. 77 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (O.G. B58/18.01.2018) the NOME Auction Implementation Scheme was approved, concerning:
1. Agreement with the provisions of Law 4512/2018 on:
· T he introduction of new Eligibility Criteria for the participation of Eligible electricity suppliers in auctions, namely to maintain or develop a retail supply activity, submitting a business plan for their growth and development in the retail market upon registration in the Eligible Suppliers Register and with a new control mechanism during the month of conducting the auction based on load declarations or the business plan submitted for new Eligible Suppliers.
· T he Modification of the procedure for the adjustment of the annual quantity to be auctioned due to the deviation of PPC's share in the retail market of the interconnected system, with an increase/ decrease in the next two auctions following the relevant RAE Decision.
140

2. Adjustment of the deadline regarding the transition period of the Greek energy market model from the current mandatory pool model to the Target Model, setting August 2018 (instead of December 2017) as the date of implementation.
3. Change in the time limit for resale of sub-products by Alternative Suppliers, from two (2) to three (3) business days prior to the Monthly sub-product Declaration Process, within the secondary market.
4. The additional Semi-annual Impact Report from February 2018 and thereafter every semester, jointly undertaken by the Greek Authorities and the Institutions, which takes into account, among others: "...(a) the introduction of the Target Model in the Electricity Market and the Forward Energy Market, (b) the timely adaptation of the NOME mechanism in order to compensate for the lignite structural measures. This adaptation will include the gradual decrease of the quantities to be auctioned along with the implementation of the lignite structural measures, the decrease ultimately being proportionate to the lignite potential that will be divested upon completion of the divestment from PPC's part, and (c) the possible need to adopt additional structural measures in line with the characteristics of PPC's productive portfolio."
· In accordance with RAE's Decision 850/2017, and with respect to the Code of Transactions for the Sale of Forward Electricity Products, the following are now applicable:
· F or the year 2017, the Administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities for Forward Electricity Products is set at 30%.
· For the first half of 2018 and for gradual adjustment purposes, the Administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 50%.
· For the second half of 2018 and up to the submission of the proposed Impact Report by the Market Operator, the Administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 70%.
· Specifically for new Eligible Suppliers which have not yet submitted load declarations within the DAS, the Administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 30% for 2018 and will be revised according to the recommendation of the Market Operator (EMO).
The Market Operator's (EMO's) recommendation for setting the Administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products will be submitted to RAE in December each year. Additionally, the possibility of submitting purchase orders under the condition of satisfying the quantity requested as a whole by the participants, is restored and it is stipulated that in the case of the zero provisionally allocated quantity of a current valid purchase order, the submitted new purchase order is considered valid in the following cases:
i) It increases the price and the numerical value of the quantity requested is greater than zero.
ii) It maintains the price level and increases the numerical value of the quantity requested.
Decision 57/2017 (O.G. 72/A/19.5.2017) of the Government's Council for Economic Policy, on the structural measures for PPC's access to lignite was published, which concerns the binding remedial structural measures, which Greece will propose to the Commission's Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp.) until November 2017 and to be implemented by June 2018 in compliance with Decisions C (2008) 824 and C (2009) 6244 of the European Commission on PPC's access to lignite, which became irreversible after the (2016) 733 and (2016) 748 decisions of the General Court of the European Union. The binding remedial structural remedies will be designed in accordance with the following principles :
· The measures will include PPC's disinvestment of lignite power generating units to existing or new alternative suppliers and other investors.
· PPC will have no involvement or connection with any element of disinvestment, including preferential electricity supply. In line with the Commission's communication on structural measures acceptable under Regulation 139/2004 and Regulation 802/2004, the purchaser(s) a) will be independent of and will not
141

annual report 2017

part b

have any association with PPC and its affiliated companies; b) should possess the financial resources, proven know-how and incentive to maintain and develop the disinvested portfolio of power generating units as a viable and active competitive power in relation to PPC and other competitors, and c) on the basis of the information available, they would not cause or threaten to cause prima facie competition concerns and they would not create a risk of delay in the implementation of the structural measures.
· Disinvestment will account for about 40% of PPC's lignite power generating capacity. The exact percentage will be determined during technical discussions with the European Commission in accordance with the abovementioned decisions. The disinvestment will include the associated lignite reserves, in accordance with paragraph 248.1 of the Commission's Decision C (2008) 824, which states that "the Hellenic Republic could reallocate some of the rights currently enjoyed by PPC in this case and given that the lignite reserves are connected to the nearby electricity generating units, access to the lignite reserves should be combined with the transfer of the ownership or the franchise of the respective unit.
· In this context, in January 2018, the Hellenic Republic proposed to the European Commission's DirectorateGeneral for Competition as a binding structural measure the disinvestment of three (3) existing PPC lignite units, namely Meliti 1 (330 MW installed capacity), Megalopolis 3 (300 MW) and Megalopolis 4 (300 MW), as well as the production license for a new lignite unit (Meliti 2, 450 MW), together with the exploration and exploitation rights of the lignite mines (Megalopolis mine for the units Megalopolis 3 and 4 and Kleidi mine, Meliti hills and Vevi for Meliti). The Directorate-General for Competition conducted a market test for the abovementioned commitment by the Hellenic Republic. On September 6th 2017, RAE put into public consultation a proposal for a new Transitory Flexible Compensation Mechanism following the expiration on April 30th 2017 of the Transitional Flexibility Compensation Mechanism. The new proposed transitional mechanism differs from the previous one in that it will be purchasing and will concern two (2) flexibility products, a three-hour and a one-hour one, the cost of which will be derived from supply and demand, but will not exceed the maximum of  25,000/ MW. The new mechanism is similar to the old one, since it entirely excludes lignite fired units from the flexibility option and also discriminates against hydro power plants and benefits open and combined cycle gas plants. RAE's consultation ended on September 22nd 2017.
· Law 4512/2018 (O.G. A5/17.01.2018) entitled "Regulations for the implementation of the structural reforms of the Economic Adjustment Program and other provisions" and in particular Articles 73-99 regulates issues related to the Establishment and Operation of the Energy Exchange through amendments to various Laws and in particular:
· L aw 4425/2016 (O.G. A185/30.09.2016), which includes provisions regarding the reorganization of the Greek electricity market in accordance with the legislation for the completion of the single European electricity market (establishment of Electricity Markets - Purchase of Future Electricity Products, Next Day Market, Intraday Market and Balancing Market - and their characteristics, the jurisdiction and the responsibilities of Market Operators, as well as issues relating to Market Codes as well as to Clearing / Transactions within these).
· L aw 4001/2011 (O.G A179/22.08.2011) entitled "Operation of Electricity and Natural Gas Markets, for Hydrocarbon Research, Production and Networks and other regulations".
HELLENIC ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION SYSTEM (HETS)
· RAE by its Decision 404/2016, approved the Required Revenue of the HETS Operator for 2017 to the amount of  202.6 mil. Based on the required revenue of 2017, the new use of transmission system charges were determined (RAE Decision 456/2016). Moreover, RAE by its Decision 253/2015 amended the provisions of the Grid Control Code and of the methodology for the determination of the Required Revenue so that interconnection rights auction costs (clause 3) are taken into account.
· With its 394/2016 Decision (Use of Congestion Income, from the country's international interconnections access rights, for the year 2017), RAE approved the use of  46 mil., from the Reserve Account (Interconnections Transfer Capacity Allocation according to article 178 of the Greek Grid Control Code For
142

Electricity) that IPTO keeps, for the reduction of the Annual Cost for the use of the Transmission System, for the year 2017.
· Following RAE's Decision 67/2017 (OG B 774/13.03.2017) RAE monitors and oversees the progress of the implementation of the Markets and the elaboration on the individual Codes by the Market Operators and, within the framework of its responsibilities, decides on the issuance of directions to the relevant Operators for the preparation of the Market Codes provided for in Law 4425/2016, distinctively for each of these Markets and communicates them to IPTO and EMO for their respective actions.
· A ccording to RAE's Decision 346/2017, the coefficients for the penalty calculation of the Transitory Flexibility Compensation Mechanism as well as the Deviation Clearing Schedule were determined with appropriate modifications to the Greek Electricity Transmission System Management Code and the Market Clearing Manual.
· IPTO S.A. was certified as an Ownership Unbundled Transmission Operator in the context of its full ownership unbundling from PPC S.A. and in compliance with the fact that it is now under the control of a person or persons from a third country or third countries (RAE Decision 475/2017).
· F or the year 2017 in the context of the Mechanism of Settlement between the Operators of the Transmission System, the System Marginal Price was approved as the basis for calculating the cost of losses and the unit cost of losses at 48.70/MWh, according to IPTO's recommendation (RAE Decision 514/2016).
· By RAE Decision 1021/2017, (O.G. B 4690/29.12.2017), entitled "Amendment of the provisions of the Greek Electricity Transmission System Management Code (O.G.

SPECIAL FEE FOR THE REDUCTION OF CO2 EMISSIONS (ETMEAR - ex RES Fee) and RES Special Account (ELAPE)
· U nder the new RES operational support scheme (L. 4414/2016) and the provision for a new source of revenues for the RES Special Account, electricity suppliers will be compelled to pay (from October 1st 2016) an additional compensation, to the revenues of the RES Special Account and is calculated as the product of the energy absorbed (in MWh) for each load representative multiplied by the difference between the System Marginal Price (SMP) in the wholesale market and the SMP that would have existed if the RES did not enter to the system (virtual SMP). Specifically, for this extra charge, it was decided that the amount will be charged gradually to the Load Representatives (Load Representatives Uplift Charge for RES Special Account) for the additional value of energy from RES stations, as the latter is determined, based on the above methodology for the year 2016, will equal fifty percent (50%) of the charge arising from the implementation of the methodology while for the year 2017 and then after will equal one hundred percent (100%) of the charge (L. 4427/2016). Due to the fact that from the implementation of this mechanism the resulting charges where very high, RAE, after the load representatives' protests issued Decision 149/2017 establishing a maximum value for the hourly difference between the SMP and the virtual SMP in order to lower the level of charges arising. RAE also established by the same Decision the retroactive application of this threshold to all calculations from the date of the application of this mechanism. By Decision 150/2017 RAE set a ceiling for this numerical difference at 15 /MWh.
· RAE published the new charges for ETMEAR which are applicable from January 1st 2017 (RAE Decision 621/2016). In specifying the allocation coefficients for the charges, the levels specified in the EU Guidelines on State Aid for the environmental and energy sectors 2014 - 2020, as well as the provisions of Law 4414/2016 have been taken into account. With its announcement of July 5th 2017, RAE announced that it had considered the necessity of adjusting ETMEAR's charges at its plenary meeting on 29 June 2017 and decided that there was no need to review them in the present circumstances. RAE reached this Decision:
· after examining the evolution of revenues and expenses of ELAPE according to the "Monthly Report on the Special Account of RES and CHP of the Interconnected System and Network - May 2017 - settlement of April 2017" and found that ELAPE continues to be in surplus and its cumulative debt will be eliminated by the end of 2017. Considering that ELAPE will remain in surplus throughout the year 2018. Considering that the sharp and sudden fluctuations in ETMEAR charges bring a significant and multidimensional financial burden on all final consumers and hence on the liquidity of the market. With a recent announcement on September 26th 2017, RAE informed that there is still no need to update ETMEAR. The same announcement states that the evolution of ELAPE's inflows/outflows will be monitored, in particular by examining the level of critical parameters on the basis of accountable and reliable budget data, as well as the results of the ongoing consultation between the Greek authorities and the European Commission in the context of the submission of an "Adaptation Plan" in accordance

3. Basis of Preparation and Principal Accounting Policies
3.1 Basis of Preparation
Statement of Compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Approval of Financial Statements
The Board of Directors of the Parent Company approved the accompanying financial statements for the year ended on December 31st, 2017 on April 27th, 2018. These financial statements are subject to approval by the Parent Company's General Shareholders Meeting.
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for tangible assets and financial assets "held ­ for ­ sale", that have been measured at fair value), assuming that PPC will continue as a going concern. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Euro and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, drawn up to December 31st, each year. Subsidiaries (companies in which the Group
149

annual report 2017

part b

directly or indirectly or through other subsidiaries has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations) have been consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Losses within a subsidiary are apportioned to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction. All intercompany balances and transactions have been fully eliminated as well as unrealized intra ­ group gains and losses. Where necessary, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been revised to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. It is noted that certain of the abovementioned requirements have not a retrospective effect, and due to this reason the following differences are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation:
· A cquisitions of non-controlling interests, prior to January 1st, 2010, were accounted for using the parent entity extension method, whereby, the difference between the consideration and the book value of the share of net assets acquired were recognized as goodwill.
· L osses incurred by the Group were not attributed to the non-controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the Parent Company, unless the non-controlling interest had a biding obligation to cover these.
In case that the Group loses control of a subsidiary then the following are : Derecognized:
· The assets (including the surplus value) and liabilities of the subsidiary.
· The book value of the non-controlling interest.
· T he accumulated exchange differences, which have been recorded in Equity.
Recognized:
· The fair value of the price obtained.
· The fair value of the remaining participation.
· A ny surplus or deficit in the income statement.
· T he Parent Company's share in the elements previously recognized in the comprehensive income statement, in the income statement or the retained earnings where that is judged necessary.
3.2 C hanges in Accounting Policies and Disclosures
The accounting policies applied to the separate and consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied to the annual separate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st, 2016 with the exception of the following revised Standards and Interpretations, that are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2017.
· IAS 12 (Amendments) "Recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealized losses" The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for the recognition of deferred tax assets on unrealized losses arising from debt securities measured at fair value.
· IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows (Amendment) "Disclosures" The amendment introduces mandatory disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. Based on the amendment to IAS 7, an entity is required to provide disclosures that assist investors to evaluate changes in those liabilities from financing activities including changes in the cash flow statement as well as changes from non-cash items.

The Parent Company and the Group have not adopted them earlier.
· IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and subsequent adjustments to IFRS 9 ­ Classification and measurement On July 24th 2014 IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9, which includes the classification and measurement, the impairment and hedge accounting. The Standard will replace IAS 39 and all earlier versions of IFRS 9. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost, at fair value through profit or loss, or at fair value through other comprehensive income based on the business model of the entity for the management of financial assets and contractual cash flows of financial assets. With the exception for the entity's credit risk, the classification and measurement of financial liabilities has not changed in relation to the existing requirements. The application of IFRS 9 is mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018 and has been endorsed by the European Union on November 22nd 2016. Based on Management's current estimates, IFRS 9, in its initial application, as well as in subsequent periods, is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements. The Group will apply the new standard in the year 2018 by adjusting the opening balance of Retained Earnings and will not proceed to readjust the comparative figures for 2017. According to the current business model, the financial assets held by the Group (shares) will be classified in a similar portfolio in accordance with IFRS 9 and therefore no significant impact on their measurement is expected. With respect to the new impairment model for receivables, the Group will apply the simplified approach for recognizing credit losses. The Group has proceeded to grouping customers based on common credit ratings and is in the process of calculating historical default rates. The provision for impairment amount is not expected to differ significantly from the current one. The Group is in the process of finalizing the impact of IFRS 9 on its Financial Statements through additional support material which will be available in 2018.
· IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IASB issued on May 28th 2014 IFRS 15 "Revenues from contracts with customers" and together with amendments issued on September 11th 2015 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018. It is the new Standard applied for revenue recondition. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18, IAS 11 and IFRIC13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and SIC ­ 31. The new standard establishes a five-step model that will apply to revenue recognition arising from a single customer contract (with limited exceptions), to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. The requirements of the Standard will also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-financial assets that are not produced by the entity's ordinary
151

152

activities (eg, sales of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets). Extensive disclosures, including the analysis of total revenue, information on performance obligations, changes in contract asset balances and contractual obligations between periods and key judgments and estimates will be required. IFRS 15 was adopted by the European Union on September 22nd 2016.
The Group will fully apply the Standard for the year 2018, recognizing the cumulative effect of the transition on the opening balance of equity on January 1st 2018, providing comparative figures for the previous year.
The Group proceeded to assess the relevant revenues by applying the five steps outlined in the standard in order to identify areas that may be affected. Based on the Management's current estimate, IFRS 15 during its initial application, as well as in subsequent periods is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements.
· C larifications to IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In April 2016, IASB issued clarifications to IFRS 15. The amendments to IFRS 15 do not alter the basic principles of the Standard but provide clarifications as to the application of these principles. The amendments clarify how a performance obligation is recognized in a contract, how it is determined whether an entity is the originator or the trustee, and how it is determined whether the income from the grant of a license should be recognized at a particular time or over time. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2018 and has been endorsed by the European Union on October 31st 2017. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements.
· IFRS 4 (Amendment) - Applying the new IFRS 9 together with IFRS 4.
IASB issued in September 12th 2016 amendments to IFRS 4 to address the concerns arising from the application of the new IFRS 9 before applying the new amended by the Board IFRS 4. The amendments introduce two approaches: overlapping and postponement. The modified standard will:
·  llow insurance companies to recognize in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the volatility that may arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the issuance of the new standard for insurance contracts.
· P rovide to insurance companies, an optional temporary exemption from the application of IFRS 9 until 2021. Entities that will not adopt IFRS 9 will continue to apply IAS 39 for financial instruments.
The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2018 and has been endorsed by the European Union on November 3rd 2017.
· IFRS 16 "Leases"
On January 13th 2016 IASB issued IFRS 16 which replaces IAS 17. The purpose of the Standard is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide useful information that reasonably discloses the substance of transactions in leases. IFRS 16 introduces a single model for the accounting treatment on the part of the lessee requiring the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all lease agreements with a duration of more than 12 months, unless the underline asset is of non ­ significant value. Regarding the accounting treatment by the lessor, IFRS 16 effectively intergrades the requirements of IAS 17. Therefore, the lessor continues to categorize leases as operating or finance leases and to follow a different accounting treatment for each type of contract. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019 and has been endorsed by the European Union on October 31st 2017.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of applying IFRS 16 on its financial statements and the choice of the method of application. The standard will mainly affect the accounting treatment of the Group's and Parents Company's operating leases. At 31 December 2017, the Group's existing commitments for minimum future lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to  20.1 mil (Note 39).

Standards and Interpretations not yet endorsed by the European Union
· IFRS 17 "Insurance Contracts" On May 18th 2017 IASB issued IFRS 17, which replaces IFRS 4. IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the registration, valuation, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, in order to provide a more uniform valuation and presentation approach for all insurance contracts. IFRS 17 requires the measurement/valuation of insurance liabilities at current value using:
· unbiased expected weighted estimates of future cash flows based on updated assumptions,
· discount rates reflecting the cash flow characteristics of contracts and estimates of the financial and non-financial risks arising from the issuance of insurance contracts.
The new Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2021 and it has not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
· IFRS 10 (Amendment) - "Consolidated Financial Statements" and IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The main consequence of the amendment adopted by the Council on 11 September 2014 is that the full profit or loss is recognized when a transaction includes a business (whether it is hosted in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction includes assets that do not constitute a business, even if those assets are housed in a subsidiary. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016 and it has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of applying the amendment to its financial statements.
· IFRS 2: Share ­ based Payments (Amendment) "Classification and measurement of Shared-based payment transactions" The amendment clarifies the measurement basis for cash-settled, share-based payments and the accounting treatment for modifications on terms that change an award that is cash-settled or equitysettled. It also introduces an exception to the principles of IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018 and has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendment to its financial statements.
· Annual Improvements to IFRS, 2014 ­ 2016 Cycle The following amendments of the 2014 - 2016 cycle, were issued by the Council on December 8th 2016, are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018 and have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The following amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's (and/or the Group's) financial statements unless otherwise stated.
· IAS 28 (Amendment) "Measurement of investments in associates and Joint ventures at fair value" The amendment clarifies that the option given, for investments in associates or joint ventures held by an entity that is a qualifying asset management entity or other qualifying entity, to be measured at fair value through profit or loss is available for each investment to an associate or joint venture separately at initial recognition.
· IAS 40 Investment Property (Amendment) "Transfers of Investment Property" The amendment to IAS 40 which was issued by IASB on December 8th 2016, clarifies that an entity may transfer a property to or from investment property when and only when there is evidence of change in use. A change in use occurs if the property meets or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property. A change in management's intentions to use the property is not in itself an

indication of a change in use. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2018 and has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendment to its financial statements.
· IFRIC 22: Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration IFRIC 22 clarifies the accounting treatment for transactions involving the collection or payment of foreign currency advances. In particular, it applies to foreign currency transactions when an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary obligation arising from the payment or receipt of advances before the entity recognizes the related asset, expense or income. According to the Interpretation, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate is the date of the initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayments for the asset or the obligation to receive an advance. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the transaction date is determined separately for each payment or collection. The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2018 and has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying this interpretation to its financial statements.
· IFRIC 23 (Interpretation) "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments" IFRIC 23 applies to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates when there is uncertainty as to the correctness of the tax treatment in accordance with IAS 12. In this the case should be considered:
· w hether tax treatments should be considered collectively or individually and under the assumption that audits will be carried out by the tax authorities having full knowledge of the relevant information,
· t he possibility that tax Authorities will accept the way taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates are determined and
· reassessing judgments and assessments if circumstances change.
The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2019 and has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying this interpretation to its financial statements.
· A nnual Improvements to IFRS, 2015 ­ 2017 Cycle The following amendments of the 2015 - 2017 cycle, were issued by the Council on December 2017, are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019 and have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. The following amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's (and / or the Group's) financial statements unless otherwise stated.
· IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Common Agreements The amendments to IFRS 3 specify that when an entity acquires control of a company that was one of its joint ventures, it should proceed with an appreciation of the interests previously held in that undertaking. Amendments to IFRS 11 specify that an entity that is a member but does not jointly controls a joint venture may acquire joint control over the joint venture whose business is an enterprise as defined in IFRS 3. In such cases, interests previously held in that undertaking are not revalued.
· IAS 12 Income Taxes IASB by amending IAS 12, has specified that an entity should recognize all tax effects arising from the distribution of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity, depending on where the entity recorded the original transaction from which it derived the distributed profits and then the dividend.

· IAS 23 Borrowing costs The amendments clarify that if a borrowing specifically received for the acquisition of an asset remains pending and the relevant asset becomes ready for its intended use or sale, then the balance of such borrowing should be included in the general borrowing for the calculation of the capitalization rate.
· IFRS 9 (Amendment) "Financial Instruments - Prepayment characteristics with negative remuneration" IASB adopted on October 12th 2017 amendments to IFRS 9 to enable for prepaid financial assets that allow or require a counterparty to a contract either to repay or to receive compensation for the early termination of the contract, to be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The amendment applies to annual accounting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019 and it has not yet been adopted by the European Union. It is not expected that the amendment will have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.
· IAS 28 (Amendment) "Long-term Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" IASB, in October 2017, issued amendments to IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures". With this amendment, the IASB clarified that the exemption in IFRS 9 applies only to participations that are accounted for using the equity method. Entities should apply IFRS 9 to other interests in associates and joint ventures, including long-term interests to which the equity method does not apply and which are, in essence, part of the net investment in these associates and joint ventures. The amendment applies to annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and it has not yet been adopted by the European Union. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.
3.3 Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The principle judgments and estimates referring to events the development of which could significantly affect the items of the financial statements during the forthcoming twelve month period are as follows:
Post-retirement Benefits
The Parent Company provides to employees and pensioners of the Group electricity at a reduced tariff. The reduced invoice to pensioners is recognized as a liability and is calculated as the present value of future retirement benefits deemed accrued by the end of the year on the basis of the rights of employees accumulated during their service and are calculated on the basis of an actuarial model on the basis of economic and actuarial assumptions (Note 29).
Fair Value and Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group carries its property, plant and equipment at revalued amounts (estimated fair values) as determined by an independent firm of appraisers. Revaluation is performed periodically (every three to five years). The determination of the fair values of property, plant and equipment requires from management to make assumptions, estimates and judgements with respect to the ownership, the value in use and the existence of any economic, functional and physical obsolescence of property, plant and equipment. On December 31st, 2014, the Group has conducted its latest revaluation of property, plant and equipment. The management of the Group believe that any change in the fair value of tangible fixed assets will not have a significant impact on the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of December 31st, 2017. Furthermore, the management makes estimates regarding the total and the remaining useful live of fixed assets which are subject to periodic review. Useful lives as estimated are included in Note 3.4.
155

annual report 2017

part b

156

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. The determination of whether such indications exists, requires from Management to make assumptions and judgments with respect to external and internal factors that may affect the recoverability of assets, as well as assumptions on the determination of the cash flow generating units.
Cost of Dismantling of Property, Plant and Equipment
Based on the provisions of IAS 16 "Property, plant and equipment" the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes, among others, the initial estimate of the costs required for the dismantling and removal of such an item. These costs are quantified and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IAS 37 "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets". The management estimates that the cost of dismantling may, especially in the cases of lignite fired power plants as well as gas fired stations, be funded by the proceeds of the materials that will result from such a dismantling and, on that basis has not made any provision for such costs for all categories of the above mentioned power plants.
Provisions for Risks
The Group is establishing provisions concerning claims by third parties against companies of the Group and which might lead to an outflow of resources for their settlement. The provision is established based on amounts claimed and the possible outcome of the legal dispute.
Provisions for Trade Receivables
Provision for doubtful debts is established for individual high voltage customers on specific balances, when there are indications that the debts will not be collected. For medium and low voltage customers, the Parent Company establishes a general provision for the total of their outstanding balances of more than 3 and 6 months respectively, per customer. This policy is reviewed periodically in order to be readjusted according to the prevailing circumstances. Additional details are included in Note 20.
Provisions for Income Taxes and Recognition of Deferred Tax Receivable
Current provisions for income tax liabilities for current and prior years are calculated at the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities, using the prevailing tax rates at the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes current taxes reported in the respective income tax returns and potential additional tax assessments that may be imposed by the tax authorities upon settlement of the unaudited tax years on the basis of the findings of prior tax audits. The final settlement of the income taxes might differ from the income taxes that have been accounted for in the financial statements. From the year 2011 onwards, the Parent Company and several of its subsidiaries are audited for tax purposes by the Certified Auditors Accountants in accordance with the provisions of Income Tax Legislation. The audit for the year 2017 is ongoing and the relative tax conformity report will be issued after the publication of the financial statements for the year 2017. If, at the completion of the tax audit, additional tax liabilities arise, the Management estimates that these will have no material effect on the financial statements. Deferred taxes are recognized on carried forward tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will occur to offset carried forward tax losses. Deferred tax receivables that are recognized, require Management to make assessments as to the time and level of realization of future taxable profits.
Accounting Treatment of a Business Activity's Spin-off to a Subsidiary
The management proceeds to significant judgments regarding the proper presentation of the spin ­ off and contribution of a segment by the Parent Company to a 100% subsidiary in exchange for shares, as the accounting treatment for similar transactions between companies under common control is not explicitly provided for in IFRS.
Provision for Unbilled Revenue
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the

financial report

Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue from all types of electricity sales is accounted for on an accrual basis. Especially for low voltage customers at each balance sheet date, unbilled revenue is recorded to account for electricity delivered and consumed by these customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenue is estimated using certain assumptions with respect to quantities of electricity consumed, network losses and average electricity sale prices. The actual amounts that will be finally billed, may differ from those provided for.
3.4 Principal Accounting Policies
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional and reporting currency of all the Group entities is the Euro. Transactions involving other currencies are converted into Euro using the exchange rates, which were in effect at the time of the transactions. At the balance sheet dates, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency adjustments are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), net, in the accompanying statements of income. Non-monetary items in foreign currency which are valuated at acquisition cost are converted using the exchange rate of the date of acquisition. The non-monetary elements which are measured at fair value in foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate of the fair value's calculation date. The profit or loss from the conversion of non-monetary items is treated the same way as the profit or loss from the conversion of fair value of these elements.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include software and CO2 emission rights allowances. Software
Software programs are measured at their acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation and impairments. For all assets retired or sold, their acquisition cost and related depreciation are removed from the accounts. Any gain or loss is included in the statement of income. Software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years.
CO2 Emissions Rights The Parent Company acquires CO2 emission rights in order to meet its liability stemming from the actual CO2 emissions of its generation units. This liability is measured at fair values to the extent that the Parent Company has the obligation to cover its emissions through purchases (after the offset of any free CO2 emission rights held). Emission rights purchased and held are recognized as intangible assets, at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Tangible Assets
Tangible assets are initially recognised at their acquisition cost which includes all direct attributable expenses for their acquisition or construction. Subsequent to their initial recognition, tangible assets (with the exception of mines and lakes which are valued at cost minus accumulated depreciation and eliminations) are valued at their fair values minus accumulated depreciation and eliminations. Estimations of fair values are performed periodically by independent appraisers (every three to five years) in order to ensure that fair value does not differ significantly from the net value of the asset. The last assets' evaluation was completed on December 31st 2014. Any valuation increase is credited to the revaluation surplus net of deferred taxes. At the date of revaluation, accumulated depreciation is offset against pre depreciation accounting values and net amounts are restated according to revalued amounts. Any decrease is first offset against an earlier valuation increase in respect of the same fixed asset and thereafter charged to the income statement. Upon disposal of a revalued tangible asset, the relevant portion of the revaluation surplus is released from the revaluation surplus directly to retained earnings. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Subsequent expenditures
157

annual report 2017

part b

158

are capitalized if they meet the recognition criteria as tangible assets. For all assets retired or sold, their acquisition cost and related depreciation are removed from the accounts at the time of sale or retirement, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of income.
Borrowing costs
From January 1st, 2009, borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that needs a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of the relevant assets. The new accounting policy is implemented on fixed assets recognized from January 1st, 2009 herein (new constructions). All other remaining borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the average estimated remaining useful economic life of the assets. The useful lives (in years) applied for the calculation of depreciation, have as follows:

Buildings and Technical Works
Buildings of general use Industrial buildings Dams Machinery and Equipment Thermal power plants Gas Turbines Mines Hydro power plants Autonomous diesel power plants Transmission Lines Substations Distribution Substations Low and medium voltage distribution network Transportation assets Furniture, fixtures and equipment

Mining Activities
The Parent Company owns and operates open-pit lignite mines. Land acquisition (mainly through expropriation) and initial (pre-operational) development costs relating to mines are capitalized and amortized (upon commencement of the mines' commercial operation) over the shorter of the life of the mine and twenty (20) years. Exploration, evaluation and ongoing development costs are charged to the cost of lignite production as incurred. A provision for land restoration is established for the Group's estimated current obligation for restoration and is calculated based on the surface disturbed to date and the average cost of restoration per metric unit. It is accounted for at the present value of the related obligation to restore land back to a beneficial use and is included both in fixed assets (mines) and in provisions.

financial report

Investments in Subsidiaries
In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any impairment losses. The spin off and contribution of an activity from the Parent Company to a wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for shares, is accounted for as a transaction between companies under common control. In cases of such transactions the shares received are recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary with a value equivalent to the carrying value of the net assets contributed at the transaction date.
Investments in Associates
These are entities in which the Group has significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. The Group's investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in associates are carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate, less possible provisions for any impairment in value. In case that the Group's share in an associate's losses is equal, or exceeds its participation in the associate, the Group does not recognise the losses exceeding its participation. The income statement reflects separately the Group's share on the results of its associates, while amounts that are recorded by the associates directly to their equity are recognized directly to the Group's equity. Non ­ realised profit or loss resulting from the transactions of the Group with said associates is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates. The associates' accounting principles are adjusted, when necessary, in order to comply with those adopted by the Group. In the separate financial statements such investments are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment of Assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash generating unit's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value of sale (after the deduction of sales costs) is determined, in each case, according to the implementation of a revaluation model. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized to the income statement, except if the particular asset is valued in fair values and then the impairment loss is recognised as a decrease of the already recognised surplus value. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets' recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation), if no impairment loss had been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in profit and loss unless the asset is carried at fair value amounts in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, to be divided equally to future time spans on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and its available for sale investments at each balance sheet date and non-financial assets such as investment properties, periodically (every 3-5 years) at fair value.
159

annual report 2017

part b

160

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
· In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
· in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
· Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
· L evel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
The Group determines policies and procedures applied for both recurring measurements and assets held for distribution on operations held for sale.
Assets of substantial value, as tangible assets as well as substantial value liabilities are evaluated by the Group and the Parent Company with the assistance of external valuators. External valuators involvement needs, are annually decided by the Group, the selection criteria being market knowledge and expertise, reputation, independence and observance of professional standards.
On each reporting date, the Group, according to its accounting policies, assesses if there is any change on the carrying values of assets and liabilities being subject to periodic reassessment and revaluation. For the above mentioned assessment, the management verifies considerable inputs applied to the last asset or liability evaluation, confirming data used for the evaluation against contracts and other relevant documents. For disclosing fair values, the Group's assets and liabilities are categorized according to their nature, characteristics, potential risks stemming from specific asset or liability categories, as well as fair value hierarchy described above.
Investments and Other Financial Assets
Financial assets falling under the scope of IAS 39 are classified based on their nature and their characteristics in financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-tomaturity investments, and available-for-sale financial assets. When financial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

part b

financial report

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets after initial recognition and, where allowed, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end. All regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by law or convention in the market place.
Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss
This category includes financial assets classified as held for trading. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognized in the income statement.
Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.

Financial assets with fixed payments and fixed maturity are classified as held - to - maturity, when the Group has the intention and the ability to hold them to maturity. Investments which are held for an infinite or non ­ defined maturity cannot be classified into this category. Held ­ to ­ maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in the income when the investments are derecognized or eliminated as well as through the amortization process.
Available-for-Sale Investments
Available-for-sale investments are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified in any of the three preceding categories. After initial recognition available-for sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognized as a separate component of equity. On disposal, impairment or de-recognition of the investment, the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement. The fair value of investments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions; reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. When the fair value cannot be determined reliably, the investments are measured at their acquisition cost. If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its acquisition cost (net of any principal payment and amortization) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is transferred from equity to the income statement. Impairment losses that have been recognized previously in the income statement and relate to investments in shares are not reversed through the profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses on bonds are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in their fair value can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of Financial Assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets Carried at Amortized Cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred).
161

annual report 2017

part b

162

The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The asset's carrying amount can be impaired either through disposal or through establishment of a provision. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are deemed significant, while these which are not, are grouped and assessed as a whole. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment for impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be associated objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.
Inventories
Inventories include consumables, materials, lignite and liquid fuel.
Materials and Consumables
Materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the end product in which they are incorporated. The cost is determined using the weighted average method. These materials are recorded in inventory when purchased and then are expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.
Lignite (Self-produced and Purchased)
The cost of lignite inventories which have been excavated/purchased but not yet consumed at the date of the financial statements is stated at the balance sheet. Lignite inventories are stated at the lower of production cost/purchase cost and net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the end product in which they are incorporated with the cost being determined using the weighted average production/purchase cost method. Production/purchase cost mainly consists of expenses incurred in order for lignite inventories to be used for electricity generation.
Liquid Fuel
Liquid fuel is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value which takes under consideration the net realisable value of the end product in which it is incorporated. The cost of liquid fuel reflects purchase price plus any taxes (other than VAT), levies and other costs necessary to bring it to its present location and condition and is determined using the weighted average method for the period. Liquid fuel costs are expensed as consumed and are separately reflected in the accompanying statements of income.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Group considers time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
Share Capital
Share capital represents the par value of the Parent Company's shares fully issued and outstanding. Any proceeds in excess of par value are recorded in share premium. Expenses related directly to new shares issuance are recognized directly to Equity net of proceeds.
De-recognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Financial Receivables
Financial receivables (or, where applicable a part of a financial receivable or part of a group of similar financial receivables) are derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset

part b

financial report

have expired, (2) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement and (3) The Parent Company/ Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either: (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. Where the Group/Parent Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchase option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to either settle such asset and liability on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Interest Bearing Loans and Borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs.
Provisions for Risks and Expenses, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Claims
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal, contractual or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Post-retirement Benefits
The Parent Company employees and pensioners of the Group are entitled to the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs. Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. Retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions.
163

annual report 2017

part b

164

Net costs for the period are included in the payroll cost in the statements of income and consist of the present value of the benefits earned in the year, decreased by the benefits offered to the pensioners. The retirement benefit obligations are not funded. Unrecognized actuarial gains or losses of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of each period are recognized in the comprehensive statement of income.
Subsidies for Fixed Assets
The Group obtains subsidies from the Hellenic Republic and from the European Union (through the investment budget of the Hellenic Republic) in order to fund specific projects executed through a specific time period. Subsidies are recorded upon collection and are reflected as deferred income in the accompanying balance sheet. Amortization is accounted for in accordance with the remaining useful life of the related assets, and is included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying statements of income.
Customers and Producers Contributions in the Construction of Fixed Assets and Contributions of Fixed Assets from Customers and Producers
Customers and producers, who are connected with the transmission and distribution network, are required to participate in the initial network connection cost (metering devices, lines, substations, etc.) or other type of infrastructure, through the deposit of institutionally defined amounts or through fixed assets contribution (few cases). Until December 31st, 2008, due to the lack of detailed accounting guidance under current IFRS, the Group has elected to record upon collection of contribution from customers and producers, for the construction of assets needed for their connection with the network, and were reflected in the Balance Sheet as deferred income. Their amortization was accounted for in accordance with the remaining useful life of the related financed assets and was included in the depreciation and amortisation of the income statement (the Group/Parent Company implemented the accounting policy used for contributions).
From January 1st, 2009, the Group/Parent Company implementing earlier the Interpretation 18 "Transfers of Assets from Customers" recognize the cash and the assets received from customers and producers needed for their connection with the network, in fair values in the Income Statement. For cash received until December 31st, 2008, the Group/Parent Company used the previous adopted accounting policy.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
The Parent Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with interest rate, of foreign currency and liquid fuel prices fluctuations consumed by the Parent Company. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of such derivatives is determined by reference to fair values for similar instruments and is confirmed with the respective financial institutions with which the Parent Company has concluded the relative contacts. The effective part of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is recognized to OCI if it is related to cash flow hedges while the ineffective part is charged to the separate income statement. If the hedge is related to effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss. Under cash flow hedge accounting, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognized the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognized in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged transaction affects the net profit and loss. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the year. Certain derivatives, although characterized as effective hedges based on the Group's policies, do not meet the criteria for hedge

part b

financial report

accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39 and, therefore, gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.
Income Taxes (Current and Deferred)
Current Income Taxes
Current income tax expense consists of income taxes for the current year based on the Parent Company's profits and on the other companies of the Group as adjusted in their tax returns and, provisions for additional income taxes to cover potential tax assessments which are likely to occur from tax audits by the tax authorities, using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income tax is calculated, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base and the book value of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred income tax liability arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or of a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences carried forward as well as unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is possible that taxable profit will be available against the deductible temporary differences and the carried forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. No deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences is recognized when it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced at the time where it is not considered possible that enough taxable profits will be presented against which, a part or the total of assets can be utilized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Parent Company and the Group recognize as an expense the contribution for the employees' services payable to EFKA (Greek Single Social Security Institution) (ex. IKA-ETAM/TAP DEH, ETEA, TAYTEKO) (defined contribution plans) and as a liability the amount that has not been paid yet.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenues from all types of electricity sales are accounted for on an accrual basis. At each balance sheet date, unbilled revenue is recorded to account for electricity delivered and consumed by customers but not yet billed. Deductions from reduced consumption of electricity as defined by specific return policies of the Group are accounted when they can reliably be estimated (based on historical data, if available or on prior year's data). Revenues from rendering of services is recognized based on the stage of completion of the service rendered and to the extent that the related receivable will be collected. Revenue from interest is recognized within the period incurred and revenue from dividends is recognized when the Group's right on such dividends is approved by the respective bodies of the companies' that declare them.
Electricity
Electricity costs are expensed as purchased and separately reflected in the accompanying statement of income.

Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right or use the asset.
Group as a Lessee
Leases, which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a Lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as revenue in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Earnings/(Losses) per Share
The basic and diluted earnings per share, are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the relevant year. The weighted average number of shares is derived by adding the existing shares, that the share capital is divided, with the rights that the Parent Company owns and potentially could exercise.
Subsequent events
Post period-end events that provide additional information about the Group's position at the balance sheet date (adjusting events), are reflected in the financial statements. Post-period-end events that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes.
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
The Group classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. In sale transactions, all exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets are included, if the transaction has a commercial substance. The basic requirements for a non-current asset (or a disposal group) to be classified as held for sale are that it must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets/groups and its sale must be highly probable. Immediately, before the original classification of the non-current asset or disposal group as held for sale, the current asset or disposal group is evaluated according to the adopted IFRS's at the date of classification. Non-current assets (or a group of assets and liabilities) classified as held for sale will be measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and any possible resulting impairment losses will be recognized in the income statement. Any subsequent increase in fair value will be recognized in the income statement, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss which was previously recognized. No depreciation or amortization is recognized on a non-current asset (or noncurrent assets that are included in a disposal group) from the date that is classified as held for sale.
Operating Segment
According to L. 4001/2011, the Group as a vertically integrated undertaking is obliged to prepare and integrate in its financial statements, accounting unbundled financial statements for each segment. These include the Parent Company's activities in the Sectors of Mines, Generation, Distribution and Supply. In 2011, the Transmission activity was transferred to IPTO which is a PPC's subsidiary, according to the model of the Independent Transmission Operator and all organizational units as well as activities of HTSO that pertained to management, operation, development and maintenance of the Transmission System apart from the Daily Ahead Schedule.

part b

financial report

In 2012 the Distribution Activity was transferred to HEDNO. By the contribution of the General Division of Distribution as well as the Department of Islands' Region, to its subsidiary HEDNO, PPC has maintained the ownership of the fixed assets as well as the assets of the Distribution Network and the Non- Interconnected Islands' Network. It is noted that as of June 20th 2017, IPTO S.A, does not belong to the Group's subsidiaries and follows the model of the full onwership unbundled Transmission Operator, fully harmonized with Directive 2009/72/EC.
As a result, information disclosures by operational segment as well as the principles of segment as presented in IFRS 8 "Operating Segment" are stated in Appendix 1. and pertain only to continuing operations.

12. Discontinued Operations - IPTO's Ownership Unbudling
As described in Note 2, in December 31st 2016 the process of the ownership unbudling of the subsidiary IPTO S.A. was in progress according to the provisions of Law. 4389/2016 (Articles 142-149 and 152).
The Group's and Parent Company's Management considered that as of December 31st 2016 the criteria of IFRS 5 "Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations" are met and as a consequence, investment in IPTO S.A. was classified as held for sale and distribution accordingly (Discontinued Operations).
In this context, on 15.6.2017 (ex-rights date) the Group lost 51% of the voting rights on the share capital of the subsidiary IPTO SA, owned by its 100% subsidiary ADMIE (IPTO) HOLDING SA, through the transfer to the existing shareholders of PPC SA of the shares of the ADMIE (IPTO) HOLDING SA he held, while the full ownership unbundling was completed on 20.6.2017 with the transfer of 25% and 24% of the share capital of IPTO SA. to P.H.C. ADMIE (IPTO) S.A. and the Strategic Investor (State Grid Europe Limited) respectively, resulting in the transfer of all assets and liabilities that were classified as discontinued operations. The consideration for the transfer of 49% of the share capital of IPTO SA amounted to  623,208, while taking into consideration the contribution in kind by PPC of 51% of the share capital of IPTO SA valued at  491,770 in ADMIE (IPTO) HOLDING SA, the total consideration for the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA amounted to  1,114,978. Profit in the Parent Company's Income Statement due to the ownership unbundling of IPTO SA amounted to

· PPC's sale at 20.06.2017 of IPTO SA's 25% share capital to "IPTO Public Holding Company" (IPTO PHC), of a book value of 229,094 for 295,608 consideration. A profit of 66,514 was recognized from this sale.
· PPC's sale at 20.06.2017 of IPTO SA's 24% share capital to the STATE GRID EUROPE LIMITED (SGEL), of a book value of  219,930 for a consideration of  320,000. At the same date STATE GRID EUROPE LIMITED (SGEL) paid  7,600 being interest between the date of the share purchase agreement and the date of the conclusion of the transaction. A profit of  107,670 was recognized from this sale.
On June 15th 2017 (the ex-rights date) when PPC lost control of its subsidiary IPTO SA, in order to calculate the profit on a Group level (consolidated) of IPTO SA full ownership unbundling, the net assets of the subsidiary were calculated as presented in the following table:

According to tax legislation, the income tax rate for legal entities residing in Greece, is 29%, while at the same time tax prepayment stands to 100%.
Within the framework of the Law on the ownership unbundling of IPTO SA and by a decision of the Independent Authority for Public Revenues (IAPR), the amount of the tax due for the profits resulting from the sale of this entity, is exempted from tax prepayment. (Article 143 par. 1g of Law 4389/2016 and decision of IAPR, B 1032029/2017).
Tax returns for the companies residing in Greece are filed annually but profits or losses declared for tax purposes remain provisional until such time, as the tax authorities audit the returns and the records of the company and a final assessment is issued. The Group establishes a provision, if deemed necessary, on a case by case basis and per company, against an event of additional taxes being imposed by the tax authorities.
Based on the applicable Income Tax Code, since the fiscal year 2011, the certified auditors issue an "Annual Tax Compliance Report" after conducting a tax audit at the same time with the financial audit. The tax audit is conducted on particular tax areas, specified by an audit program, according to the provisions of the tax law. Audit matters which are not covered by the above mentioned decision are dealt in accordance to the ISAE 3000 "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information".
For the year 2016 the tax auditors of the Parent Company issued a tax certificate "without qualification".
On December 29th 2017 the tax audit by the Centre for Auditing Big Companies of the Parent Company's financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011 was completed and the final assessment for the fiscal year 2011 was issued imposing taxes and fines of an amount of  10.5 mil. Fiscal years 2009 and 2010 were time-barred. The Parent Company paid the amount of taxes and fines imposed for the fiscal year 2011 and appealed to the Dispute Settlement Division by lodging an Administrative Appeal.
Tax unaudited years for the Parent Company and the subsidiaries of the Group are presented in the following table:

High voltage customer balances relate to (a) receivables from sales of energy to 56 companies with 91 installations (or power suppliers), including large industrial companies, which are invoiced at the end of each calendar month, based on individual agreements and actual metering and (b) exports to customers abroad.
Medium voltage customers are mainly industrial and commercial companies. Billing is made on a monthly basis based on actual meter readings. Low voltage customers are mainly residential and small commercial companies.
The majority of low voltage customers are billed every four months based on actual meter readings, while interim bills are issued every two months based mainly on the energy consumed during the corresponding period in the prior year.
There are different types of tariffs for both medium and low voltage customers with different tariff structures based on different types of energy use (commercial, residential, etc). Revenues from the supply of electricity to medium and low voltage customers provided during the period from the last meter reading or billing through each reporting date are accounted for as unbilled revenue.
The provision for doubtful receivables is established, on specific customer balances. For medium and low voltage customers, the Parent Company was establishing a provision for the total of their outstanding balances when the oldest unpaid bill exceeds three and six months respectively per customer.
The movement of the provision for doubtful receivables is as follows:

Assessed taxes and penalties:
The amount represents additional income taxes and penalties assessed to the Parent Company.
An amount of  26,856 corresponds to a paid special consumption tax with recourse.
In the framework of an audit conducted by Audit Department of the Customs House for the period May 2010 to September 2012, an Imputation Act (Nr. 80/14/07.07.2015) of the Head of the 4th Customs Supervision Assembly of Piraeus was issued, which charged the Company with special consumption tax amounting  9,789,956.04 which corresponds to self-consumption quantities for the audited period to Electricity Transmission System due to non-compliance with the terms and formalities mentioned in the Ministerial Decision (.50257772010/17.06.2010) on the matter. The Company paid the charged amounts and, at the same time, appealed against the aforementioned act before the Piraeus Administrative Court of Appeals,

191

annual report 2017

part b

but since then compliant with the instructions of Ministry of Finance, PPC includes the self-consumption quantities of electricity in the Special Consumption Tax Statements which submits and pays with recourse the relevant tax, while simultaneously files a lawsuit.
An amount of  10,554 corresponds to amounts paid, which were imposed by the regular audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies for the years 2009-2011.
Following a regular tax audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies, various accounting differences were added to the Company's taxable profits for the fiscal year 2012 (reporting period 01.01.2011 - 31.12.2011) and an income tax plus an inaccuracy tax totaling  462 was charged.
A Fine of Withholding Tax of  9,855 was imposed on the ground that PPC in the same fiscal year 2012 issued false salary statements to its staff, since it did not include the employees' benefits from the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs. Finally, two fines of  900 were imposed due to overdue purchase invoices and  500 due to providing incomplete data to audit.
On 24.01.2018, against the aforementioned corrective acts an appeal was filed before the Dispute Resolution Division of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue, whose decision is expected to be issued by 24.05.2018. For this tax difference, PPC has already paid all the amounts charged.
For the amounts of  26,856 and  10,554 an equal provision has been established in the Financial Statements 2017.
Social Security Funds in Dispute
The amount relates to social security contributions and deductions (during years 1983-1993) for employees who have worked with other employers before joining PPC. As PPC undertook the obligation to cover the whole amount of their pensions and other related benefits, part of their contributions to other social security funds mainly IKA (SSI i.e. Social Security Institute which is the major Greek social security fund) has been claimed by PPC. The claim was not accepted by IKA and the case was brought by PPC before the courts. Following an adverse court decision, PPC together with PPC ­ PIO (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appealed against said decision before the second degree courts. The second degree court rejected PPC's appeal, whereas PPC ­ PIO's (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appeal against IKA is still pending. For the abovementioned amount, an equal provision has been established at the attached financial statements.
Advances to Pensioners in Dispute
The amount of  5,262 represents an advance payment made in 1993 to pensioners. An equal provision has been established of this amount.
Refunds from Mines' expropriations
The amount relates to claims for refund part of the compensation paid by the Parent Company for expropriations of lignite mining areas.
Refunds resulted from the difference determining temporary and final compensation unit price (the final prices were lower than the corresponding temporary ones).
State Participation in Employees' Social Security Contributions:
The amount represents the State's contribution to the social security contributions of employees who started working after January 1st, 1993. For the above mentioned amount, an equal provision has been established.
The movement in the allowance for other receivables is as follows:

24. Share Capital
Under Law 2773/1999 and P.D. 333/2000 PPC was transformed, into a société anonyme. By the Legislative Act of 07.09.2012, which was ratified by art. 2 of L. 4092/2012, the obligatory participation of the Greek State with at least 51% of the company's share capital was abolished. The Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, which was convened on November 30, 2012 decided to abolish the article of incorporation which provided for the participation of the Greek State by at least 51% to the company's

193

annual report 2017

part b

share capital. This amendment of the Articles of Incorporation on one hand harmonizes the articles with the legislation in effect, and on the other hand renders possible the reduction of the current participation percentage of the Greek State to the company's share capital.
At December 31st, 2016, PPC's share capital (fully authorised and issued) amounted to  1,067,200 divided into 232,000,000 common shares of Euro four and sixty cents ( 4.60) per value each.
The Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting with its decision on 17.01.2017 and in the context of the distribution to the existing PPC's shareholders of the shares held PPC in the "Holding Company ENERGIAKI S.A."(ENERGIAKI HOLDING S.A., and then ADMIE HOLDING) according to Law 4389/2016 (carve out), approved (a) the decrease of PPC's share capital by  491,840 "with the purpose of the distribution in Kind to its shareholders" and (b) as a consequence of the above mentioned distribution in Kind, the transfer to its existing shareholders of the shares held PPC in the "ENERGIAKI HOLDING S.A." in proportion to their participation in PPC's share capital. This decrease achieved by means of decreasing the nominal value of the PPC's shares from Euro four and sixty cents ( 4.60) per value each to Euro two and forty-eight cents ( 2.48).
After this decrease, on 31.12.2017 PPC's share capital amounts to  575,360 divided into 232,000,000 common shares of Euro two and forty-eight cents ( 2.48) per value each.

25. L egal Reserve

29. P ost Retirement Benefits
The Group's employees and pensioners are entitled to the supply of electricity (which the Parent Company provides) at reduced tariffs. Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. The relevant retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions. Net costs for the period are included in the payroll cost in the accompanying income statement consisting of the present value of the benefits earned in the year, interest cost on the benefit obligation, as well as prior service cost. The actuarial gains or losses are now recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) based on the revised IAS 19 (effective from 2013). Retirement benefit obligations are not funded. Results of the

The amount of customers' advances relates to advances made from customers upon initial connection to the transmission and/or distribution networks and is considered as coverage against unbilled consumption outstanding as of any time. Such advances are refundable (non-interest bearing) upon termination of connection by the customer. As the refund of such amounts, which are payable on demand, is not expected to be realised within a short period of time the amounts are classified as non-current liabilities and they are not discounted.

36. A mendments
Deferred tax assets on the obligation for the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs
The Group's employees and pensioners are entitled to the supply of electricity (which the Parent Company provides) at reduced tariffs (see Note 3.4-Post-retirement benefits). Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. The relevant retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions.
Until 31.12.2015, the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs were not deductible therefore the Group and the Parent Company did not recognize deferred tax asset on the formed actuarial obligation.During the first quarter of 2017, the above tax regime was clarified following a Tax Authority's reply to a relevant question by the Parent and a subsidiary and the tax deductibility of benefits from the fiscal year 2016 was possible. However, when the Group and the Parent Company prepare the financial statements for the year 2016, they did not recognize the amount of deferred tax asset corresponding to the aforementioned actuarial obligation.
Within the year 2017, the Group and the Parent Company rated this issue as "mistake" in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8, calculated the amount of the deferred tax asset and restated the equity and the amount of deferred tax assets as at 31st December 2016 and income taxes and earnings per share for the year ended 31st December 2016 as well as all the above amounts of the first half 2017. This restatement does not have a cash-flow effect.
The effect of the above restatements on the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements is presented in the following tables:

Revenues from Low Voltage Customers
The Parent Company, at each balance sheet date, calculates based on an estimation method the amount of unbilled revenue, recording a provision for accrued income at year-end. This amount is recalculated at each balance sheet date.
During the process of preparing the annual financial statements for the year 2017, the Parent Company found that the method followed for calculating the amount of unbilled revenue to low voltage customers for the years 2015 and 2016 was not appropriate in the circumstances taking into account the amount of energy injected in the network, the recovery data of these energy values in relation to the existing pricing circuit and that this led to overestimation of the relevant amounts.
The Group and the Parent Company rated the above as "mistake" in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8, and by applying the appropriate estimation method, proceeded to a restatement of the trade receivables of unbilled revenue, trade receivables from customers and deferred tax liabilities as of 01.01.2016 and 31.12.2016 and 30th June 2016 and 2017 and the revenues and the earnings per share for the year ended 31st December 2015 and 2016 and of six-month periods ended 30th June 2016 and 2017. This restatement does not have a cash-flow effect.

37. C ommitments, Contingencies and Litigation
Ownership of Property
Major matters relating to the ownership of the Group's assets, are as follows:
1. The Parent Company has completed the registration of its property through a fixed assets registry. These assets (almost entirely) are registered at the relevant land registries over the country and the cadastral application is monitored. The update of the existent in the company new integrated information system for fixed assets management is in progress.
2. In a number of cases, expropriated land, as presented in the expropriation statements, differs (in quantitative terms), with what the Parent Company considers as its property.
3. Agricultural land acquired by the Parent Company through expropriation in order to be used for the construction of hydroelectric power plants, will be transferred to the State at no charge, following a decision of The Parent Company's Board of Directors and a related approval by the Ministry of Development, if such land is no longer needed by the Parent Company for the fulfilment of its purposes according to article 9, of Law 2941/01.
The property, plant and equipment of the Group are located all over Greece. Currently, the Group does not carry any form of insurance coverage on its property, plant and equipment (except for its information technology equipment), resulting to the fact that if a sizable damage is incurred to its property, it might affect its profitability. Materials, spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured. The Group is currently evaluating the possibility ­ in the newly formed legal framework, to conduct a tender for the selection of an insurance company to cover for its assets as well as liabilities against third parties.

Litigation and Claims
The Group from continuing operations is a defendant in several legal proceedings arising from its operations. The total amount claimed as at December 31, 2017 amounts to  1,480 mil. as further detailed below:
1. Claims with Contractors, Suppliers and Other Claims
A number of contractors and suppliers have raised claims against the Company. These claims are either pending before courts or under arbitration and mediation proceedings. The total amount involved is  444 mil. In most cases the Group has raised counter claims, which are not reflected in the accounting records until the time of collection.
2. Fire Incidents and Floods
A number of individuals have raised claims against the Company for damages incurred as a result of alleged electricity-generated fires and floods. The total amount relating to fires is  46 mil.
3. Claims by Employees
Employees are claiming the amount of  205 mil., for allowances and other benefits that according to the employees should have been paid by PPC.
4. Litigation with PPC Personnel Insurance Organization (PPC-PIO)
Until December 31, 2017,PPC Personnel Insurance Organization (former "PPC PIO", EFKA at present) had filed, before the courts, seven (7) lawsuits against PPC, claiming an amount in total of  87.7 mil., out of which three (3) are pending for a total amount of  7 mil.
5. General Federation of PPC Personnel (GENOP DEI/KHE) and PanHellenic Federation of Retirees' (POS DEI) lawsuit against PPC
GENOP DEI/KHE and POS DEI have filed a lawsuit against PPC in the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens. By the above mentioned lawsuit they pursue that PPC will be obliged to pay to third parties, who are not litigants, in particular the insurance funds of IKA ­ ETAM and TAYTEKO (EFKA at present) the amount of  634.8 mil. plus interest, for the coverage of the resource, which according to the lawsuit, the State did not pay to the above mentioned insurance funds for the years 2010 and 2011. The lawsuit is scheduled to be heard in the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens on September 18th, 2014 but it was postponed and heard on February 23rd, 2017. The decision (Nr. 164/2018) for the above mentioned lawsuit was issued and rejects the lawsuit. In view of the fact that the above mentioned lawsuit is based on admissions which are in contrast with the provisions of Decision 13/2010 of the Supreme Court (see also 1767/2014, 299 and 805/2015) and Decision 668/2012 of the Athens Court of Appeals, the Parent Company considers that the possibilities of a positive outcome for the lawsuit in question are minimal and therefore, has not formed a provision.
6. P PC's lawsuit against ETAA (former TSMEDE)
ETAA (former TSMEDE) by its Decision 7/2012 has imposed on PPC the amount of  27.4 mil. in application of article 4 of L. 3518/2006, as employer contributions due to the Main pension Branch for the period 01.01.2007 - 30.04.2012 and pertaining to the engineers insured before 01.01.1993 to the above mentioned Insurance Fund, that have been employed by PPC for the above mentioned period. Against the above mentioned 7/2012 decision of the Insurance Fund in question, PPC has filed (legally and timely) the 05.09.2012 appeal to the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance. The discussion of the appeal took place on 03.11.2014. The preliminary ruling 11872/2016 was issued, which obliges TSMEDE to produce to the Court the documents referred to in the judgment and then the case will be discussed again in order to issue a final decision. Since its employees ­ who are engineers- are insured mandatorily to PPC's Insurance Fund based on L. 4491/1966, thus resulting to PPC paying on their behalf to the above mentioned Insurance Fund the corresponding employer contributions while insurance for the above mentioned engineers in ETAA is optional and is done by choice, with them paying the corresponding
207

annual report 2017

part b

insurance contributions provided for engineers that are independently employed, the Parent Company considers that the possibilities of a negative outcome of its appeal are minimal and therefore has not established a provision.
7. A nnulment requests against the request for binding offer (RfBO) by PPC S.A. for the sale of 24 % IPTO's shares
An annulment request has been filed in front of the Supreme Court against PPC's RfBO (Request for Binding Offer) in 2016 for the sale of 24% of IPTO's (PPC's subsidiary) shares. The above mentioned request was filed by General Federation of PPC Personnel (GENOP DEI/KHE).The applicant for annulment, GENOP/KHE, filed a written declaration of resignation (No. 2144 / 31.03.2017) which was, accepted by the President of the Supreme Court.
8. L awsuits of IPTO against PPC
IPTO has filed against PPC, two lawsuits for a total amount of  540 mil. for amounts due - according to IPTO - to the Parent Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market. In particular:
· B y its first lawsuit IPTO is asking for an amount of  242.7 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which the Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO, that in turn conveys them to EMO. The interest for the above mentioned sums amounts to  22.5 mil.
· B y its second lawsuit, IPTO is asking for the payment of  232.6 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which the Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO. The interest for the above mentioned sums amounts to  40.6 mil.
The lawsuits were scheduled to be heard on May 18th, 2017 in the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens and were postponed for February 28th 2019.The Parent Company considers that there is a chance of paying interest on certain sums due and has established a provision of  31.5 mil. It is noted that PPC, if necessary, will file lawsuits against IPTO as well. On its side, the Parent Company has served an extrajudicial document inviting IPTO to pay a total amount of  14 mil. The above mentioned amount corresponds to overdue interest of invoices which incorporate debts to PPC from March 2012 until the 02.02.2015. IPTO, up to this date, has not answered to this extrajudicial document. In December 2016, IPTO filed against PPC a new lawsuit (with the new Civil Procedure, i.e. without specific hearing date), by which IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of  406.4 mil. (with interest) for overdue receivables arising from the Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market and refer to specific non-competitive charges of IPTO invoices. Moreover, IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of  52.9 mil. corresponding to interest litigation plus the relevant stamp duty. The Parent Company considers that it is likely to be asked to pay interest on certain overdue receivables, and has established an adequate provision.
For the above amounts, the Group from continuing operations and the Parent Company have established provisions which as of December 31, 2017 amounted to  192 mil. and  168 mil., respectively (2016: Groupincluding IPTO S.A.:  150 mil. and Parent Company:  114 mil.), which are considered adequate for the expected losses arising from the final judgement.
PPC's relation to its personnel's Social Security Funds
Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group does not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit between income and expenses to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
Litigations Risk
The Group and the Parent Company are involved in several legal proceedings arising from their operations, and any adverse outcome against PPC or any other of the Group's companies may have a negative impact on their business, financial condition and reputation. In addition, as a majority state owned utility, the Group is subject to laws, rules and regulations designed
208

part b

financial report

to protect the public interest, such as of public procurement or environmental protection. Violation of such legislation, entails, among others, criminal sanctions for the Board of Directors members and executive officers as well as the employees of the companies and utilities that are subject to those rules. Simultaneously, the Group is one of the largest industrial groups in Greece, with complex activities and operations across the country. In the ordinary course of its business, from time to time, competitors, suppliers, customers, owners of property adjacent to the Group's properties, the media, activists, and ordinary citizens, raise complaints (even to public prosecutors) about the Group's operations and activities, to the extent they feel that such activities and operations cause or are likely to cause economic damage to their views and/or interests, businesses or properties and, in the context of advancing those complaints, they often file criminal complaints against the Group. In this context, reports involving complaints and accusations for allegedly unlawful acts of executives against the Group usually involve their further investigation by the Prosecuting Authorities in the so-called preliminary proceedings, which usually ends up in the closing of the investigated case due to lack of conclusive evidence. These practices have intensified during the recent economic crisis, as public prosecutors and the general public have generally become more sensitive to similar allegations, especially against companies in which the Hellenic Republic is a major shareholder and are viewed as operating in the public interest. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company, their Board of Directors members and directors, are at present and could be in the future, subject to various criminal or other investigations at various stages of procedural advancement on a variety of grounds arising in connection with their activities in the ordinary course of business. These investigations and legal proceedings may be disruptive to the Group's and the Parent Company's daily operations to the extent that the officers and directors involved need to spend time and resources in connection therewith. They may also adversely affect the Group's and the Parent Company's reputation, although to date, none of the proceedings initiated against the Group and the Group's officers or directors has resulted in any criminal convictions.
PPC's audit by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition
Since February 2017, a European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition audit of the Parent Company is in progress in accordance with Article 20 of the Regulation 1/2003 of the European Union. The audit is carried out pursuant to a relevant Commission's decision dated February 1st 2017 for alleged abuse of a dominant position on the wholesale market for the production of electricity from 2010 onwards. This audit is in progress.
Litigation with "louminion of Greece" (ALOUMINION) and already today and after its merger by absorption from `'MYTILINEOS S.A. ­ GROUP OF COMPANIES"
1. On 31.10.2013 with a majority of two to one (2/1) Decision No. D1/1/2013, the Permanent Arbitration Court of RAE decided the price for the supply of electricity to ALOUMINION S.A. at  40.7/MWh for the period 01.07.2010 until 31.12.2013. At this price both the fixed and variable energy costs were included, as well as System Use Charges, Ancillary Services Charges, Public Service Obligations, and state fees on behalf of RAE and HTSO/EMO, although Renewable Energy/Gaseous Pollutants special fees/ETMEAR, Special Electricity Tax, DETE and other taxes imposed were not included. The burden on the financial results of the third quarter of 2013 imposed by the above mentioned Decision, as far as the supply of electricity to ALOUMINION is concerned, for the period 01.07.2010 until 30.9.2013 amounted to  105.5 mil. As the abovementioned Decision compelled PPC to sell at a loss, PPC filed a lawsuit for invalidity against it, which was scheduled to be heard on December 4th 2014, and was postponed for October 1st 2015 and, in addition, submitted a complaint for state aid before the European Commission (December 2013). Regarding PPC's appeal for the annulment of RAE's Arbitration Decision, the Athens Court of Appeals issued on February 18th 2016 a decision (634/2016), not accepting PPC's lawsuit for the annulment of RAE's arbitration decision No 1/2013 and against ALOUMINION. This decision has become irreversible. The European Commission by a letter in June 12th, 2014, notified PPC that it does not intend to further examine the complaint. PPC has challenged the Commission's decision in front of the General Court of the European Union by its
209

annual report 2017

part b

appeal dated August 22nd 2014 (case T-639/2014).
On April 17th 2015 PPC was notified of a subsequent decision (dated March 25th 2015) of the European Commission, through which, the latter concluded, as the decision dated June 12th 2014 had, that PPC's complaint, concerning illegal state aid towards ALOUMINION, does not require further investigation concerning state aid but using a different rationale. More specifically, the new decision is based mostly on the fact that the decision to resort to arbitration met the criteria of a private investor and therefore that it could not lead to an illegal state aid. PPC has challenged the Commission's second decision in front of the General Court of the European Union (case T-352/2015).
On May 31st 2017 the Court delivered its judgment in favor of PPC in Case C-228/16 P (PPC v Commission, T-639/14, which concerned the annulment of the aforementioned decision of June12th 2014), in which it accepted the claim of PPC to set aside the above-mentioned order of the General Court of February 9th 2016 (regarding the dismissal of the first above mentioned trial T-639/14) and ordered the case to be referred back to the General Court for a ruling on PPC's claims. The Court therefore referred the case to the General Court of the European Union. Subsequently, August 23th 2017, the Commission notified PPC of its new Decision (No. (2017) 5622 final), which, according to the text of this new Decision, revokes the letter of 2014 and its confirmatory decision of 2015 replacing them with this new above mentioned Decision. With this new Decision, the Commission has accepted that the measure in question does not constitute state aid for the same reasons as it set out in its repealed Decision of 2015. PPC filed an appeal on November 2nd 2017 before the General Court of the EU for the annulment of the judgment of August 14th 2017 and the C (2017) 5622 final Decision [Case SA.38101 (2015 / NN) (ex 2013 / CP) Alleged State aid to ALOUMINION in the form of lower-cost electricity tariffs upon arbitration]. By letter of 21st December 2017, the General Court called on the parties in Case SA.38101 to submit their comments on the possible suspension of the proceedings in Case T-352/15 and T-639/14 RENV, PPC v Commission, until the conclusion of the written procedure in Case T-740/17 PPC v Commission. PPC requested the suspension of the procedure.
2. State Aid of  17.4 mil.
On 13.07.2011 the Commission issue the decision regarding the state aid (Case SA.26117-C 2/2010 ex NN 62/2009) which according to the decision, the Hellenic Republic awarded an amount of 17.4 mil., to ALOUMINION, as a result of the implementation of a favorable tariff for the period January 2007 ­ March 2008 in violation of Article 108, paragraph 3, TFEU. The Commission further ordered the Hellenic Republic to recover the aid. Subsequently, PPC (September 2011) was instructed by the relevant ministry (Ministry of Development) to recover the amount of aid given that PPC was the final beneficiary of aid.
On October 6th , 2011, ALOUMINION requested the annulment of the Decision. PPC has intervened in favor of the Commission. With the decision dated 8.10.2014, "ALOUMINION against Commission" (T-542/11), the General Court annulled the Commission's decision.
On December 18th, 2014, PPC filed an appeal against the General Court's decision. The Court, by its decision of 26th October 2016, (C-590/14 P), set aside the original judgment, referred the case back to the General Court and reserved the court costs.
The General Court (Fifth Section), by its decision of 13th March 2018, rejected ALOUMINION's appeal and judged that the latter bears its own court costs, as well as the court costs of the Commission and PPC.
It is noted that PPC, on February 22nd 2018, received from "MYTILINEOS S.A. - GROUP OF COMPANIES" the amount of aid with a total payable value of  24,451,153 (including an amount of  17,375,849.48 for capital plus statutory interest and plus stamp duty 3.6%). The Central State Aid Unit of the Ministry of Finance (LTC-IC) and the European Commission were informed about the collection.
3. Continuation of ALOUMINION Pricing
ALOUMINION does not accept tariffs for the High Voltage Customers, which were decided on PPC's 28.02.2014 General Shareholders' Meeting and proceeds with a partial payment of the amounts due to PPC for the consumptions of its industrial installations, calculating, by its statement, the supply tariff of the energy consumed for the year 2014, on the base of the above mentioned 1/31.10.2013 Arbitration Decision.
210

financial report

In addition, ALOUMINION, in months of negotiations has denied all proposed tariffs by PPC, since 2013, including the tariff decided by PPC's General Shareholders Meeting on 28.02.2014.
On 20.03.2015 a document of the Competition Committee (CC) was notified to PPC, by which CC asked the submission of PPC's views on a memo submitted by ALOUMINION, with which the latter asked from the CC, on 25.02.2015, to apply interim measures (among others the suspension of PPC's complaint regarding its supply relationship dated 07.11.2013, as well as its January 2015 declaration of discontinuation of representation of ALOUMINION's meters). PPC has submitted the relevant data in time. Following an oral hearing of the case on 15.10.2015, PPC submitted the final set of commitments undertaking that : a) within ten (10) days of the notification of the CC's decision, will proceed in recalling the order for the deactivation of ALOUMINION's load meters which has been sent by PPC to ALOUMINION and IPTO SA by its extrajudicial statements on 02.01.2015 and 19.01.2015 and b) that it will continue to supply electricity to ALOUMINION under the current terms and conditions, while the issue of ALOUMINION's electricity tariffs, will be resolved through either direct negotiation between the parties or by any other means. Negotiations should have been completed within three (3) months from the date of CC's acceptance of the commitments. The latter date has been extended until 31.05.2016. Meanwhile PPC would refrain from adopting, and generally taking any measures against ALOUMINION. The above mentioned PPC's commitments were accepted by the CC, which issued the relevant decision (621/2015). Abiding by its commitments, PPC recalled the order for the deactivation of ALOUMINION's load meters. Subsequently, negotiations were held between the parties, while an extension of the quarter in which the parties must conclude their negotiations was granted twice by successive decisions of the Competition Committee (CC), initially until 31.05.2016 and then until 08.07.2016. The theme of "Electricity Supply Agreement between PPC S.A. and ALUMINION OF GREECE S.A" was introduced at the 14th Annual General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders dated 11.07.2016, which decided to postpone its decision on the matter for the next General Meeting.
On 13.09.2016 PPC's BoD decided to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of PPC's Shareholders on 05.10.2016. On the latter's agenda the above mentioned matter was included. By the October 5th, 2016 Decision of the EGM of PPC's Shareholders the customer's (ALOUMINION) pricing terms for the period 1.7.2016 - 31.12.2020 were approved, as well as pricing for the period 1.1.2014 - 30.6.2016. Based on the Decision of the EGM, a Supply Agreement was signed on October 20th 2016 between ALOUMINION and PPC. Under the signed agreement, ALOUMINION proceeded to a prepayment of  100 mil. for future electricity bills for the first contractual period July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017, as well as to a prepayment of  29.1 mil for the second contractual period of July 1st 2017 to June 30th 2018.
Old Bank of Crete
The dispute with the old "Bank of Crete" is dating back to 1989, when the bank was under liquidation. More precisely, by a mandatory action of the then trustee of the Bank, PPC's deposits were mandatorily converted to stake-holding in the share capital of the Bank and to obligatory credit to the Bank. PPC by its July 22, 1991 lawsuit against the bank asked to be compensated for GRD 2.2 billion approximately, ( 6.5 mil.) for the reason that the above mentioned Act of the trustee of the Bank was held invalid. Moreover, PPC had outstanding loan balances, received under six (6) loan agreements for which it was agreed upon to be repaid gradually throught installments. On June 10, 1991, although PPC has paid the overdue installments, the Bank has terminated all of the above mentioned loan agreements and thus on that date the claim against PPC became overdue for the whole amount of the loans. For that reason, against PPC's above mentioned lawsuit, the Bank has proposed an offset of its claim resulting by the above mentioned loans, amounting to GRD 4 bil. approximately, and furthermore has asked the payment of this amount by PPC by its lawsuit dated 28.12.1995. The Court of First Instance has postponed the hearing of the Bank's lawsuit against PPC until the final outcome of the hearing, which started with PPC's lawsuit against the Bank.
PPC's lawsuit against the Bank was rejected by the Court of First Instance and PPC appealed against the said Decision of the Court which was also rejected by the Athens Appeal Court.The above mentioned decision was brought to review by PPC before the Supreme Court, which accepted it and in consequence the case was again brought to trial before the Court of Appeals, which held that an expert report should take place. After
211

annual report 2017

part b

the said expert report the Court's decision was held partially in PPC's favor (Court of Appeals decision 2005). However, a petition for review before the Supreme Court was filed against the aforementioned Decision which was then accepted by the Supreme Court and then was resubmitted to the Court of Appeals which by its inconclusive decision (Nr 4093/2009) ordered the completion of the expert report. The official expert report was completed at the end of May 2012. Following that, the hearing of the case would have taken place on October 25, 2012, but it was postponed for September 26, 2013, due to the strike of both judges and lawyers. The case was heard on the abovementioned date. Decision 3680/2014 of the Court of Appeals was issued, which only partially accepts PPC's lawsuit while essentially accepting the results of the ordered by the Court above mentioned official expert report, as following : a) the amount due by the Bank of Crete to PPC at the time of the filing of the lawsuit by PPC on 22.07.1991 amounted to GRD 1,268,027,987 and b) The amount due by PPC to the Bank of Crete on 01.07.1991 due to the loan amounts becoming overdue by the Bank and after the suggested by the Bank set off of its counterclaim against the above-mentioned PPC's claim, amounted to GRD 2,532,936,698. PPC appealed against the above mentioned decision on June 19th 2017, but a hearing date has not yet been specified (Decision 3680/2014 of the Court of Appeals). It is noted that until the final judgment on the appeal, the discussion of the aforementioned (28 December 1995) lawsuit of the Bank of Crete against PPC is pending. In case that the Supreme Court accepts PPC's appeal for annulment, then it will judge the case anew and the decision which it will issue will be irrevocable. In case of a positive outcome for PPC, for which there are increased probabilities, then the case of the Bank against PPC might be rejected.
Complaint against the European Commission's Decision regarding lignite extraction rights
On May 13th, 2008, PPC filed before the General Court of the European Union (General Court), an application for the annulment of the Commission's decision of March 5, 2008 regarding the granting by the Hellenic Republic of lignite extraction rights to PPC. The Greek State has intervened before the aforementioned Court in favor of PPC, while two competitors of PPC have intervened in favor of the European Commission. Furthermore, on August 4, 2009, the European Commission issued a decision (which was notified to PPC on August 7, 2009), in which the measures for the compliance with the decision of March 5, 2008 were determined as obligatory for the Hellenic Republic. The Commission's Decision made obligatory for the Hellenic Republic the launching of public tender procedures for the concession of lignite rights for the mines of Drama, llassona, Vevi and Vegora to third parties excluding PPC, unless there were no other reliable offers. The Hellenic Republic was also obliged, to ensure that the third parties that would be awarded the relevant extraction rights, would not sell to PPC the extracted lignite from the specific mines, unless there were no other reliable offers. PPC submitted an application for the annulment of the said decisions of the Commission before the CFI of the European Communities and the Hellenic Republic has intervened in favor of PPC. The hearing of the cases took place before the General Court on February 2, 2012. Subsequently, the General Court of the European Union (Sixth Section) on 20.9.2012 issued two (2) decisions (Cases T-169/08 and T-421/09) in favor of PPC. The Commission appealed for the revision of the relevant decisions before the General Court of the European Union (Cases C-553/12 and C-554/12). The abovementioned appeals have been notified to PPC on December 19, 2012. On March 25, 2013 the companies "MYTILINEOS S.A ­ GROUP OF COMPANIES", "PROTERGIA S.A." and "ALOUMINION S.A." filed before the European Union Court, an intervention petition in favor of the European Union and against PPC, for the annulment of the above mentioned Decision of the General Court of September 20th, 2012. The hearing of the case took place on October 3rd , 2013. On July 17, 2014, the Court of the European Union has issued a decision on the annulment requests for the Commission, by accepting them. In particular the Court of the European Union, by citing cases, accepted that for the application of the directives in question of the union law it is required (but also enough) the adoption of a measure, by which a member state exclusively grants rights to a public company, creates an inequality
212

of opportunities between companies and thus drives the company to an abuse of its dominant position. The European Union's Court has not accepted the Commission's request to judge the case in its substance following the injunction of the decision in the first degree but referred the case again to the General Court of the European Union, in order for it to deliver a decision on the remaining annulment reasons, which, although PPC had invoked in front of the Court, the General Court had not examined. In Case T-169/08 RENV, PPC put forward four reasons for the annulment of Decision C (2008) 824: a) an error in law and a manifest error of assessment, b) breach of the duty to state reasons, c) violation of the principles of legal certainty, of the protection of legitimate expectations and of protection of private property as well as abuse of power and d) violation of the principle of proportionality.
In Case T-421/09 RENV, PPC put forward four reasons for the annulment of Decision C (2009) 6244: a) an error in law and a manifest error in the definition of the relevant markets, b) a manifest error of assessment of the facts and error in law concerning the necessity of the imposed measures, c) breach of the duty to state reasons and, d) violation of the principle of contractual freedom and of the principle of proportionality.
Before the hearing of the case, the General Court of the European Union requested that the parties reply to inquiries sent to them on February 2016. The parties submitted to the Court their written replies. On 08.03.2016 both Case T-169/08 RENV, in which parties are PPC as an applicant and the Hellenic Republic as intervener in favor of PPC and on the other hand the European Commission and the "Thessaloniki Energy S.A.", " Greek Energy & Development SA " as interveners in favor of the Commission and "MYTILINEOS SA."," PROTERGIA SA " and "ALOUMINION SA" as interveners in the appeal, as well as Case T-421/09 RENV between the same parties (but without interveners) were discussed before the General Court.
By its Decision of December 15th 2016 the General Court of the European Union rejected the reasons for annulment put forward by PPC. An appeal against the judgment of the General Court was feasible, limited to legal matters, within two months after the notification of the Decision. Eventually, PPC did not proceed to an appeal, hence the March 5th 2008 Decision of the European Commission became irrevocable. Following this procedure, the Greek State committed to the European Commission to undertake structural initiatives which resulted in the introduction of a Bill for the establishment of two new entities whose shares would be sold to investors.

It is noted that following the issuance of RAE's Decision 285/2013, EMO sent a letter to PPC, according to which an amount of  96.6 million is seemingly allocated to PPC, based on the finalization of the methodology by RAE for "the fair allocation of payments imposed by EMO as well as the coverage of deficits in the Day Ahead Schedule (DAS) between electricity suppliers participating in DAS". These deficits were created by third party suppliers during 2011 and 2012.
Following this letter, EMO allocating a total amount of  96.6 mil. in seven monthly installments starting from August 2013, sent to PPC the related briefing notes amounting to  13.8 mil., each. PPC considered that EMO's alleged claim violates fundamental principles of law, while simultaneously neither the amount nor the reasons for this claim are substantiated. In addition, the relevant RAE Decision was contested in court. In particular, PPC had already filed an application for annulment of RAE's Decision 285/2013, before the Council of State, as well as, an action for the suspension of such Decision, until a final judgment is issued by the Council of State. The hearing for the application for the annulment took place on March 18th 2014. In the meantime, the Council of State had issued an interim Decision (n. 62/2014), which suspended the payment of 50% of the amount of  96.6 mil., which was attributable to PPC.
At the same time, EMO had filed a lawsuit in the Multimember Court of First Instance for an amount of  55 mil. which is the equivalent of 4 equal installments out of the total amount of  96.6 mil. The hearing of this lawsuit has been scheduled after postponement for June 7th 2017, when it was canceled on EMO's initiative. This happened because in the middle of the litigation lawsuit, the State Council's Decision 1761/2016 cleared the legal challenge on the validity of RAE's Decision 285/2013 which constituted the
213

legal basis of the dispute in the Court of First Instance.
PPC, following the State Council's interim decision, has recognized in its books since 2014 a provision of 50% of the amount of  96.6 mil. due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of this amount in the future. In September 2016, PPC's application for annulment was rejected by the State Council (Section D', decision 1761/2016). As a consequence, PPC recognized the remaining 50% of the above mentioned amount in the results for the six month period ended 30.06.2016.
Following the above decision of the State Council, EMO in November 2016 sent an "Information Note on the allocation of the monthly deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule ( DAS )", which informed PPC regarding the final settlement of these deficits according to Article 61 of the Power Exchange Code for Electricity at the expense of load representatives (suppliers of Electricity) and the allocation methodology. According to the final statement the amount allocated to PPC amounted to  126.3 million. As a result, PPC recognized, with prejudice to its legal rights, the residual amount of  29.7 mil. in the results of the Third Quarter 2016.
In addition and following the above mentioned EMO's Information Notes of November 2016, PPC's BoD with its decision 146/21.12.2016, decided among other things to approve the payment of  71,766,679.78, in twelve (12) equal monthly interest-free installments to the conventional Producers starting from January 1st 2017, concerning deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule ( DAS), due to the default of financial obligations by third party suppliers during 2011 and 2012, according to Article 61 of the Power Exchange Code for Electricity, under the condition of signing an agreement with all the parties involved.
However, EMO on December 23th 2016 filed a lawsuit against PPC asking approximately the amount of  78 mil., plus interest, which according to EMO is the residual amount that PPC owes as a registered Load Representative from the DAS settlement and the State Council's decision 1761/2016, including also the amounts of  746 and  16.7 thousands that PPC owes to EMO as Last Resort Supplier and as Universal Service Supplier. The above mentioned lawsuit was filed in accordance with the new provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the hearing of the case was determined for November 9th 2017.
PPC filed on February 20th 2017 a counter lawsuit against EMO and the above mentioned lawsuit, which will be discussed together with the above mentioned EMO's lawsuit on November 9th 2017. Both lawsuits have been discussed and a decision is pending.
In addition, the company "ELPEDISON" by two lawsuits requests EMO to be ordered to pay to "ELPEDISON" an amount of  89.4 mil. (with interest), stemming from its participation to DAS. The lawsuits are founded to RAE's Decision 285/2013, according to its second part, which forbids the practice of offsetting claims from the participating in DAS with claims from other causes. Specifically, it claims that EMO's negligence to demand from PPC to stop the practice of offsetting amounts not pertaining to the DAS market has led to EMO's inability to timely pay ELPEDISON which is why it claims the above mentioned amounts from EMO. The lawsuits were scheduled to be heard in the Multimember Court of Piraeus on May 25th 2016.
EMO asked PPC to participate in the above mentioned trial (where the two lawsuits would have been heard together) as a procedural guarantor asking with an incidental request that PPC is reprobated to pay the above mentioned sums (according to PPC's share of the electricity supply market energy) in case of an adverse decision. The notice of EMO against PPC for the latter's participation in the trial of "ELPEDISON" against EMO was going to be heard together with the main trial at the hearing of May 25th 2016. The additional independent intervention which PPC brought into trial hearing on March 30th 2016 was postponed, but it was to be heard for relevant reasons together with the above mentioned main trial and notice of the EMO on May 25th 2016. The above mentioned cases were postponed on the initiative of "ELPEDISON", which is the first applicant, and upon consent of EMO and PPC.
The companies "HERON II THERMAL POWER PLANT VIOTIAS S.A." and "PROTERGIA THERMAL POWER PLANT AGIOY NIKOLAOY S.A.", by similar lawsuits request EMO to be ordered to pay to them the amounts of  14.3 mil. and  3.8 mil. respectively stemming from their participation to DAS.
EMO asked PPC to participate in the trials as a procedural guarantor asking with an incidental request that PPC is reprobated to pay the above mentioned sums (according to PPC's share of the electricity supply market energy) in case of an adverse decision.
The main applicant "PROTERGIA THERMAL POWER PLANT AGIOY NIKOLAOY S.A." resigned from its main

lawsuit in December 2016, and EMO with its e-mail on March 20th 2017, informed PPC that its notice against PPC was postponed and was not discussed at the court date April 28th 2017.
Similarly, "HERON II THERMAL POWER PLANT VIOTIAS S.A." with e-mail on March 20th 2017 informed the other litigants (EMO and PPC) that it does not intend to discuss on May 3rd 2017 its main lawsuit as well as to submit proposals, thus both the main lawsuit and the related notice of EMO were postponed upon a relevant consensus of all litigants.
In summary, all the aforementioned related trials (lawsuits HERON II , PROTERGIA and EMO's notices) were dismissed.
In December 2017, EMO sent two new "Information Notes on the allocation of the monthly deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule ( DAS )", amounting to  831,865.31 and  1,537.28 respectively, totaling  833,372.89. With the attached letters, EMO claimed that its two new claims arose from the second settlement of the Deficit in 2011 and 2012. PPC sent the two invoices to EMO, expressly contesting the legality and methodology of calculating those retroactive charges and EMO returned them by attaching them to its letter of Nr. 301/16-1-2018. Following this, on 05.03.2018, PPC filed before Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens its lawsuit against EMO, requesting a declaration that does not owe the abovementioned amount of  833,372.89 and ordered EMO to pay an amount of  50,000.00 as compensation due to moral damages. The hearing of this lawsuit has not yet been scheduled.
· Offsets of Photovoltaic Systems Producers in buildings
Moreover, the above mentioned RAE's Decision 285/2013 which does not permit the netting of amounts that PPC owes to EMO based on DAS settlement, including energy generated by PVs on rooftops, with the amounts that PPC is contractually required to pay directly to the generators in question, based on the feed - in tariff, leads to delays in recovering the latter amounts from EMO. The non-implementation of an offset does not impact financial results but will have a negative effect on cash flows, due to the increased working capital needs, since PPC is obliged to await payments in cash from EMO through the relevant special RES account. The issue in question concerns monthly amounts of  16.5 mil. on average and the total amount to be recovered could reach approximately  80 mil. based on an estimated five-month waiting period. EMO has already filed both a claim and an application for interim measures before the Court of First Instance of Athens against PPC. On the application for interim measures Decision 6022/2014 of the Multimember First Instance Court of Athens was issued, ordering a temporary injunction on offsetting amounts due from DAS with amounts claimed from other causes at a percentage of 50% of the amounts claimed.
Following the issuance of the decision 1761/2016 (State Council Section D') and hence the confirmation of the legality of RAE's Decision 285/2013, PPC can no longer offset amounts raised from its status as a Producer and Supplier simultaneously, in relation to the energy produced by Photovoltaic Systems in buildings. In view of this, the lawsuit filed by EMO and was pending for the hearing date of January 12th 2017, with a request to recognize the non-existence of PPC's right to proceed in offsettings, was postponed on EMO's initiative. Respectively, with the same lawsuit, an additional intervention of SPEF in favor of EMO was postponed, which was set to be discussed at the same hearing date.
Corrective settlements of IPTO, concerning the Special Account of art. 143, of Law 4001/2011
According to L.4152/2013, RES energy purchases in the Interconnected System are disbursed through the market operation, on the higher amount of either their income from DAS plus Imbalance settlements or the value of energy they inject to the system multiplied by the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants. This amendment started being applied from August 14th 2013, when RAE's Decision 366/2013 was published in the OG, amending the relevant articles of the Power Exchange Code and specifying the methodology of calculations, with which the provision of the law was implemented. In October 2013, IPTO sent to PPC S.A. corrective clearing statements for May, June, July and part of August of 2013, totaling to an amount of  48.2 mil., which was derived from the retrospective application of the relevant methodology. PPC's lawsuit against IPTO for the invoices in question was accepted by the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens (Decision 2260/2016) and is considered that PPC does not
215

annual report 2017

have to pay the invoices issued totaling  54.4 thousands, which incorporate claims for the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants for months May to August 2013.
ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS
Key uncertainties that may influence the final level of environmental investment which the Group will be required to undertake, over the forthcoming decade, include:
1. H PP Messochora (161.6 MW)
On 04.08.2017, the Joint Ministerial Decision regarding the Environmental Terms for HPP Messochora has been issued under which PPC is obliged to perform protection projects for the preservation part of the Messochora Village (Section D). Along with the procedure for the initial expropriation of the remaining areas flooded by the Reservoir and Sectors A, B, and C of Messochora Village and the fulfillment of the obligations introduced by the new Joint Ministerial Decision, the preparation of Tender Documents for the remaining projects, is planned, with an estimated operation of the Project in 2020. On 31.12.2017 the aggregate expenditure amount for HPP Messochora amounted to  281 mil., while an additional amount of  104 mil. is estimated to be required in order to complete the project.
2. Under IPPC (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) Directive, the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion Plants ­ BREF LCP (with a thermal capacity greater than 50 MW) was issued in July 2006. In accordance with the European Directive 2001/80/EC, a pollutants emissions reduction plan for existing Large Combustion Plants has been approved by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, was submitted to the authorities and has been incorporated in the National Emissions Reduction Plan of Greece for the period 2008-2015, according to the provisions of the aforementioned Directive. In December 2010, the new Directive (2010/75/ EU) was issued for industrial emissions (Industrial Emissions Directive ­ IED), revising Directives IPPC and 2001/80/ EC, which is effective from January 6th 2011. Following the provisions of Article 32 of Directive 2010/75/EU, a Transitional National Emissions Reduction Plan (TNERP) for the period 2016-2020 was elaborated and officially submitted by Greece to the EU at the end of 2012. The TNERP was approved by the EU on November 26, 2013. On December 2013, PPC submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Energy an application for limited changes to the TNERP, along with its declaration to use the limited life-time derogation (Article 33) for certain Power Plants. After the approval from the Ministry of Environment and Energy the revised TNERP was resubmitted on March 18th , 2014 by the Greek authorities and was approved by the EU on July 7th , 2014. The Joint Ministerial Decision for TNERP was issued in August 2015 (Nr. 34062/957/103/2015). Finally, according to the above, SES AgiosDimitrios, Meliti and Megalopolis A' and B' are included in the TNERP, while SES Amyntaion and Kardia will use the limited life-time derogation. In 2011 began the process of revising the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques Manual for Large Combustion Plants within the framework of Directive 2010/75/EU, and is coordinated by the EIPPCB (European IPPC Bureau). With the European Commission's decision 2017/1442 on 31.07.2017, the Conclusions on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion Plants ­ BREF LCP were determined under Directive 2010/75/EU. The Decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on August 17th 2017. Following the adoption, of the legally binding, conclusions of the revised Manual, additional investments in PPC's major thermal stations may be required.
3. On November 28th 2015 Directive 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and the Council's of November 25th 2015 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from Medium Combustion Units, regardless of the type of fuel used. As Medium Combustion Units, are defined units with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MWth and less than 50 MWth. Pollutants in question are sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust, while rules for the monitoring of emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) are defined. Production units of such a size, operate mainly in the islands (engines and turbines). Also, in many of PPC's SES, there are many G/S and auxiliary boilers, but with limited operating time. The provisions of the new Directive should be thoroughly examined by the competent departments of
216

part b

financial report

PPC, so as together with the competent Greek authorities to timely promote the appropriate strategies for the electrification of the islands with technically and economically viable solutions which should also be promptly implemented, and in any case before the expiry of the deadline laid down by the Directive. Indicatively, major projects such as the islands' interconnection, should be planned and implemented in such a way as to fully cover the needs of all islands in electricity, while any remaining production units will be used as a backup solution and will be operating only in an emergency, not exceeding 500 hours of operation per year.
4. T he extent of land contamination has to be assessed for many of PPC's installations, following the provisions of art. 22 of Directive 2010/75/EU. At present, there appears to be no requirement for largescale remediation projects at PPC's sites, and it is unlikely that this will be required at the mining areas or at the lignite-fired power stations for the foreseeable future. Remediation, however, may be required, at some of the company's oil-fired power stations in the future. In the context of the decommissioning of the Unit Agios Georgios in Keratsini, a remediation study for the land and the underground water in the Unit was submitted in November 2016 and was approved by the Competent Authorities on July 2017. The remediation cost is estimated at  213 thousands.
5. P PC has performed limited studies on the presence of asbestos-containing materials, at its premises. Upon submission by PPC of a full environmental impact assessment study, the Ministry of Environment issued in May 2004 the environmental permit for the construction and operation by PPC, in its premises in Ptolemaida area of an environmentally ­ controlled Industrial Waste Management Area for the management and final disposal of asbestos containing construction materials, from the plants of the Northern System. With the real estate transfer contract no. 37244/05.06.2015, which is legally transcribed, PPC transferred full ownership of the Industrial Waste Management Area, located at the Kardia Mine of the Western Macedonia Lignite Center, in DIADYMA S.A. From the date of signing the contract, DIADYMA S.A. is responsible for the Area's management.
6. During the operation of the Transmission Lines, Substations and Hyperhigh Voltage Centers, there is no electromagnetic radiation, but two separate fields, the magnetic and the electric field. At places where the public or the Company's personnel might find themselves close to the above mentioned lines and substations, the values for those fields are substantially less than the limits. Those limits were established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). The above mentioned limits have also been adopted by the European Union as well as the Greek State. It must be noted though, that the limits stated in the above regulations for both fields do not constitute dangerous values, but rather contain large safety factors, in order to cover for some vagueness due to the limited knowledge about both the magnetic and electric fields' influence in order to fulfil the requirement for the prevention of any adverse impacts.
7. The Environmental Permit for Klidi Mine is expected to be issued.
8. Furthermore the Parent Company's Mine Environmental Department has carried out all required procedures which are provided for by the Environmental Legislation, for the renewal of Environmental Permit for Amyntaio and Megalopolis Mines.
CO2 Emissions
During March and May 2013, CO2 emission licenses have been issued for all 31 PPC installations, for the 3rd implementation phase of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS phase III, from January 1st 2013 to December 31st 2020). On November 2015 the license of the Lignite Centre of Western Macedonia thermal station was revoked due to its decommissioning. On May 2017 the licenses of Ptolemaida and Agios Georgios thermal stations were revoked due to their decommissioning, and as a result PPC's bound installations amount to twenty-eight (28). On 31.03.2018, the verification of the annual emissions reports of 28 bound plants of PPC for 2017 by accredited third party verifiers was completed successfully and the reports were promptly submitted to the

combines the exploitation of overflowing water from the existing irrigation dam in Pezi, with the utilization of wind power. The project consists of:
· Two small Hydropower stations at the locations of Proespera (1.05 MW) and Lower Proespera (3.1 MW).
· Wind Park in Stravokountoura location of 2.7 MW.
· Two water tanks with a capacity of 80.000 m3 each.
· Pump station with 12 pumps of 250 KW each.
The project will increase the energy penetration by RES about 50% in the Ikaria's electrical system and will contribute to avoiding carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 13.800 tons per year. The project was completed to the percentage of 85%. During the 1st half of 2018 the trial operation of the Wind Park is expected to start. The completion of the project delayed significantly due to contractual dissents with the contractor. In 2017, works were restarted. Recently the contractor proposed - and the Company accepted - to proceed to a "friendly settlement procedure" to resolve contractual dissents. The entire project will be completed and connected to HEDNO's electricity network in early 2019. From an audit of any impairment of the cost of the project ( 43.2 mil. as of 31.12.2017) an impairment loss of  4.2 mil. was recognized in the income statement.
Research, Development and Exploitation of Geothermal potential
PPC Renewables has leased from the Greek State the geothermal potential Research and Management rights of four (4) public mining sites: a) Milos-Kimolos-Polyagos, b) Nisyros, c) Lesvos and d) Methana. While maintaining the exclusive Research and Management rights, PPC Renewables seeks a Partner to coexploit the geothermal potential of the above areas for power generation. For this purpose, the company issued an international tender, which includes two phases: During the first stage of the Tender, on June 10th 2017, the "Call for Expressions of Interest for the selection of a Partner in the field of geothermal power generation (installation of geothermal power plants)" was published. A total of seven interested parties submitted expression of interest documents and six of them were eligible for participation to the second stage of the procedure. The second stage of the tender, which is in progress, constitutes of two stages.

The two companies set up Working Groups and recruited a specialized Consultant for the preparation of a Relevant Feasibility Study for the purpose of implementing the Memorandum of Cooperation. The Feasibility Study, in the context of Memorandum was completed in July 2017.
Memorandum of Understanding between PPC and CMEC
On September 14th 2016 PPC and the Chinese company China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding of one year duration, according to which CMEC will consider its participation, along with PPC, in a company which will undertake the construction and operation of the already licensed lignite plant Meliti II, the operation of the existing plant Meliti I, as well as the development and exploitation of lignite mines in Meliti - Florina region. The planning of the company includes the participation of other partners with mining activities in the area. Participation of each of the participants in the company will be proportional to the value of the assets that will be contributed. In the period January 16th ­ 19th 2017 a team of CMEC experts visited Meliti Plant and the Mines which feed it, for data collection and talks with the respective PPC team. On 14.09.2017, one year has elapsed since the signing and formally declared automatic termination of PPC-CMEC MoU. In any case, the progress of the PPC-CMEC MoU depended on the disinvestment of PPC's portfolio of power generating stations (Decision 57/2017 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy), which will be finally agreed between the Government and the European Commission. Moreover, on October 24th 2016 PPC and CMEC signed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement of five years duration, under which the two companies will examine their cooperation for investing in Greece and other countries of interest.
Recruitment of Strategy Consultant
Within the second Quarter of 2017, the Parent Company's BoD decided to award to McKinsey & Company the support work on the configuration of structural measures which are required for the further liberalization of electricity market and the updating of its Strategic and Business Plan. The Consultant's work is in progress.
Project for the disposal of a segment of customer portfolio
Law 4336/2015 provides for the gradual reduction of PPC's retail market shares in order to reach a below 50% level in 2020. In order to achieve this share loss, PPC through NOME type auctions will provide access to third parties on its electricity generation in very low prices. The planned project involves the disposal of a segment of PPC's customer portfolio in third parties through an International Tender. PPC's aim is to achieve a reduction of its market share by maintaining greater control over its client mix, as well as preventing the adverse effect of NOME auctions on its profitability. Technical-economic and legal consultants have been hired in order to support PPC in designing and implementing the Tender and the transaction. The work of the consultants will be completed by taking the final decisions on the matter.
Memorandum of Understanding between PPC and China Development Bank (CDB).
During the 82nd Thessaloniki International Fair and the Conference organized by PPC on "Investment Opportunities in Southeastern Europe - Trends and Challenges in the Energy Sector", a Memorandum of Understanding between PPC and the China Development Bank (CDB) was signed on September 9th 2017. The Memorandum provides for the development of a strategic partnership between PPC and CDB to finance projects in the energy sector in Greece and the wider region, including the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. CDB is a development bank under the direct supervision of the Council of the State of China and is one of the largest financial institutions in the world.

maintenance, rental, training, fault diagnosis and repair of gas turbine, steam generators, generators, boilers and other equipment used in power stations or for industrial use, to companies in Greece and Europe, with the option of extending this cooperation to other areas.
Collaboration framework with DEPA S.A.
The pending conventional issues of years 2013-2016 between PPC and DEPA, which emerged from the unilateral determination of the implementation of the new DESFA transportation tariffs by DEPA as far as the usage cost of borders' entry points is concerned, as well as the pricing of natural gas purchases, were settled. Furthermore, it should be noted that an additional expenditure of  24 mil. (including interest) was incurred to PPC, due to the revision (increase) of the natural gas supply price in the contract between DEPA ­ BOTAS for the years 2012-2015, following a relevant decision of the International Court of Arbitration that settled the dispute between the two aforementioned companies. This amount is payable to DEPA in twelve (12) equal monthly interest free installments, starting from October 2016. The above mentioned expenditure burdened the results for the year 2016.
Special Consumption Tax on Electricity
In implementing the audit findings by the Audit Department of the Customs House regarding the special consumption tax on electricity self-consumption by power plants, the Parent Company includes in its monthly special consumption tax returns the related tax and pays it with recourse, while also resorting to the Administrative Courts. The Parent Company will continue to pay with recourse, the special consumption tax on self-consumed electricity until a final decision by the court is issued.
The Group and PPC are subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to companies of the broader public sector
As long as the Hellenic Republic, as the major shareholder of PPC, holds 51% of its share capital, the Company shall, in some respects, continue to be considered a public sector company in Greece. Therefore, its operations shall continue to be subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to public sector, affecting thus specific procedures, including but not limited to personnel salaries, maximum level of salaries, recruitments of employees, as well as the procurement policies etc. The said laws and regulations, particularly within the framework of the current financial conjecture and the relevant decisions of the Central Administration, which are not applicable to the Parent Company's current and future competitors, may limit the Parent Company's operational flexibility and may also have significant negative impact on its financial results, cash flow and on business risk management. It should be noted that the Group did not have for several years (till today) the ability to recruit experienced personnel in the range of its business activities while, today's average personnel age is approaching 49 years. The Group's inability to recruit specialized personnel negatively affects the ability of the new PPC Group to elaborate and implement its strategy in the new competitive and financial environment, as well as to adequately staff basic supportive operations at the level of new subsidiaries. Furthermore, there is a risk of losing managers and experienced personnel to the competition mainly because of restrictions on remuneration policies. The viability and development of PPC Group in the new business environment notably depend on the ability to attract and maintain skilled and specialized personnel and executives. According to L. 3833/2010 and L. 4057/2012, concerning the recruiting of permanent staff an approval of the Interministerial Committee is necessary (AIC 33/2006), as well as an allocative act of the Minister of the Interiors and Administrative Reorganization according to the 1:4 ratio (a recruitment for every four employees leaving) for the year 2017 and 1:3 ratio for the year 2018 of all the broader public sector bodies. By the above mentioned and introduced by law hiring procedure, the Parent Company's recruitment needs are significantly hindered, creating critical lack of personnel and managers and may have a negative impact on the implementation of the Groups' activity.

38. Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management
Fair value and fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuing technique:
Level 1: Q uoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the reporting period there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurement, and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurement. The following tables compare the carrying amount of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments that are carried at amortized cost to their fair value, as well as those of tangible fixed assets which are revalued periodically at their revalued amounts:

Macroeconomic conditions in Greece ­ Imposition of capital Controls
By the Legislative Act of 28/06/2015 (GG 65 A' / 28.06.2015) a bank holiday was declared while capital controls were imposed. The bank holiday ended on 20.07.2015, while capital controls remain in effect, however they are smoothed gradually. Capital controls include both quantitative restrictions on cash withdrawals and on payments abroad. As the Group and the Parent Company are active almost exclusively in Greece, any change and development at the macroeconomic and microeconomic environment of the country, affects directly and significantly the activities, the operating results, the financial condition and their cash flows.
Financial Risk Management
Fair Value The amounts reflected in the accompanying balance sheets for cash, current assets and current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of investments available for sale that are traded on stock markets are based on their quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The carrying values of long-term borrowings approximate their fair value because these loans are in local currency and mainly of floating interest rate. For all derivatives, the fair values are confirmed by the financial institutions with which the Group has concluded the relative contacts.
Credit Risk
The Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects depend highly on the social and macroeconomic conditions in Greece, as practically almost of the Group's assets and economic activities are in Greece. Despite the fact that, electricity sales are dispersed over a large number of customers with a wide and diversified range of operations, the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent on their customers' ability to repay their obligations. The current economic environment, the imposition of capital controls and the recent intense recession had a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity, mainly resulting from:
· Difficulties in payment and increases in delayed payments, by Low and Medium voltage customers as well as High voltage customers. Despite the fact that a large number of the Parent Company's customers have concluded favorable settlements for the payment of their overdue electricity bills and the granting of a uniform discount of 15% to all Low and Medium Voltage residential and business consumers, provided they timely pay their current bills and the complying with any settlement concluded or to be concluded, the Parent Company cannot estimate the number of customers that will comply with the terms of the settlement already in effect. Already a significant percentage of settlements is canceled through an automated procedure by PPC's computerized systems due to non-compliance.
· A sizeable number of enterprises, especially small and medium sized which cease their operations due to the economic conjecture and leave behind unpaid bills.
· The prospective increase of the Social Solidarity Tariff (SRT) beneficiaries along with the increased difficulty that these customers face in paying their electricity bills.
· The lack of the ability (following RAE's decision) to transfer debts of the same customer between its various electricity bills for household use, which accounts for the majority of customers (70% of the customers).
· Incidents where customers (both household and commercial) with debts due to electricity consumption or electricity theft, attempt to change their electricity supplier under a different name (or a different Tax Identification Number) in order to avoid restrictions that the Electricity Code imposes.
· T he fact that some customers under the pretext of the current economic downturn are not fulfilling their obligations or delay their payments, despite the fact that they afford to do so.
226

part b

financial report

· Customers not accepting charges that are not directly related to electricity consumption, but constitute a significant portion of the electricity bill (e.g. PSOs and Renewables levy).
The Group and the Parent Company may also face difficulties or delays in their ability to collect payments from their customers as a result of additional new measures that burden electricity bills with new or increased charges in favor of third parties, such as the Renewables levy (ETMEAR).
This might extend the delay of collecting electricity bills and create additional needs of working capital for the Parent Company, bearing also in mind that ETMEAR, amongst others, is paid to the competent authorities regardless of whether it has been collected from the Parent Company's customers.
Additionally, the Parent Company's collection enforcement mechanisms may be affected by legislation or other administrative acts, (for example by restricting disconnections for non-payment of electricity bills for certain categories of customers or in areas that are declared to be in an emergency state, where customers benefiting from such decisions stop paying their bills), which can adversely affect the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk
The Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations consist of bank loans, bonds and overdrafts. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution of the loan portfolio between fixed and floating interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio.
As of December 31st 2017 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging.
Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars, the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that a) any undertaken hedging transactions may not provide full or adequate protection against these risks and b) capital controls and Greece's as well as the greek banking sector's economic situation significantly limit the ability of the Parent Company in undertaking derivative hedging transactions to cover currency risk.
The following table depicts the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group' s profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings (in  million): The Group's figures for 2017 include only continuing operations.

Liquidity Risk
The current macroeconomic and financial environment in Greece, especially after the imposition of capital controls, which remains volatile, may have a considerable adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business activity, financial position and prospects. Currently, the economic situation in Greece has directly affected the capital levels, liquidity and financial position of the Greek financial system, which highly affect the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity and access to credit as well as the liquidity of the Greek economy as a whole and the Group's as well as the Parent Company's customers' ability to access credit. In addition, access to foreign financial markets is limited. Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows for the financing of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as the servicing of the Group's and the Parent Company's debt. The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including:
· The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills.
· T he obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT when due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected from the Group's and the Parent Company's customers.
· T he burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying in the same time amounts due to third parties.
· T he continuous increase in the number of disadvantaged citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding (a) a longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue). b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest, c) limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.
· R egulatory measures on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as a Supplier (new charges for the RES Account).
· T he potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.
The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs for accessing and finding liquidity ( for refinancing existing debt and / or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years. The contractual maturities of the principal financial liabilities (borrowings), not including interest payments are as follows:

40. Significant Events
LARCO Tariffs
PPC's BoD by its decision Nr. 12/09.01.2017, raised the issue of LARCO's pricing, including the implementation of the settlement of previous years' debts, to the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting (EGM) on January 12th 2017 to take a relevant Decision. The EGM by its decision dated January 12th 2017 approved LARCO's pricing terms for the period 01.01.2016-31.12.2020 as well as the settlement of its debts from electricity consumption for the period 01.07.2010-31.12.2016. Article 3(ii) of the Pricing Terms provided that for securing PPC's future contractual claims, an amount of at least  3 mil. from each of LARCO's monthly electricity bill will be paid directly by the largest customers of LARCO, by virtue of a concession of equal claims of LARCO from them. Then and before signing the relevant contract, LARCO declared inability to abide by this term and proposed a restructuring of the term in question through a monthly pledge of at least  3 mil. on its bank account. As a result, the Board of Directors by its Decision Nr. 38 / 30.03.2017 approved and recommended to the General Meeting the amendment in question. The EGM by its Decision dated 12.06.2017 approved the above mentioned amendment. It is noted that LARCO's General Shareholders' Meeting by its Decision on March 29th 2017, also approved the draft of the above mentioned Supply Agreement in order for an Electricity Supply Agreement to be signed between the parties. Following the approvals of the General Meetings of the two companies, the Electricity Supply Agreement was signed on June 21st 2017. Due to non-compliance with contractual obligations of the above-mentioned 21.06.2017 Electricity Supply Contracts and Pledged Receivables on the part of LARCO, PPC, in order to defend its interests, has already proceeded with the actions provided for by the contracts.
Commercial policy and Management of overdue debts
PPC, in order to manage the problem of overdue debts, proceeded in making decisions and implementing combining actions with key objectives:
· Limiting the rate of increase of debts and protecting PPC from new doubtful receivables.
· Improving the collectability of electricity bills and enhancing its liquidity.
· Improving consistent customers' behavior through incentives and enhancing the sustainability of settlements.
· Limiting the number of those customers that constantly do not pay their bills, as well as the number of customers with delinquent behavior (incidents of electricity thefts, violation of the metering devices).
More specifically: PPC provided a Settlement Program of thirty six (36) installments for all customers with a duration from 01.04.2016 to 10.01.2017, and gave a "second chance" until 10.03.2017 for reintegration into this, to those customers who have not been able to meet their debt settlement by settling their debts to the remaining installments, including the current debt. Moreover, for those customers that were unable to pay their overdue debts, PPC offered the ability for their re-integration in a Settlement Scheme until May 31st 2017 subject to an advance payment (10% - 30% on a case-by-case basis). Moreover, from July 1st 2016 till today, PPC provides a 15% discount to residential and business customers. Specifically, all residential and business customers who will pay full their bills as well as any debt settlement installments, until payment due date, they will receive a refund (credit) on their next bill, 15% of the value of the electricity consumption in previous bill which has been paid on time. Given that the effectiveness of the above actions was not the expected one, as there is a percentage of clients with a very low response rate to the above Favorable Programs and the incentives for the consistency in the payment of bills and installments, the Parent Company, through a Tendering procedure, hired QUALCO S.A. On 05.12.2017, the Contract with QUALCO was signed and is called upon to develop a debt management strategy, to define systematic actions for managing it, to study financing opportunities, to design an

implementation framework and to take over the management of a selected customer segment with overdue debts. From Qualco, we expect to propose not horizontal solutions but measures and products based on international practices of a personalized approach that will be more efficient both for the Company and the customers. The Company's aim is not only to improve its liquidity, but to upgrade customer relationships, a more meaningful communication with each customer individually At the same time, PPC continues its efforts for more effective collection of receivables from its customers, plans and implements additional actions, such as:
- t he "Prepaid Account" Program with a discount of 6% to customers that choose to prepay the total value of one year electricity bills. This program was launched in early 2017 in order to be provided to all corporate customers and expanded to cover residential, business and agricultural customers from mid-June 2017,
- the ability to issue a "Monthly Billing" to those customers who wish to receive a bill online each month (Over the course of a 4-month period, 3 estimated bills and one based on actual meter readings) in order to better plan the monthly charge for electricity. The "Monthly Billing " is provided by the December 2017.
Landslide of Amyntaio Mine
On June 10th 2017, a materials' landslide of a large scale occurred in Amyntaio Mine of the Western Macedonia Lignite Center which included a large part of the mine excavation area. The landslide and the masses that shifted were about 80 million cubic meters resulting in severe damages to part of the mine's fixed equipment. In particular four of the six excavators were affected and part of the lignite conveyor equipment. One of the four affected excavators is directly repairable at a low cost. The direct financial impacts are related to the damage occurred to the fixed equipment, the value of which has been depreciated significantly. In any case, its replacement is not necessary given that the remaining equipment, combined with contractors' equipment, which is already used in the mine, is sufficient to cover the needs of SES Amyntaio. The long-term impacts concern the part of the field that may not be fully exploitable, the value of which will be evaluated after the completion of a drilling survey already in progress. In any case, a significant part of the deposits of the 24 million tonnes remaining in the mine (since 01.01.2018), are related to the expansion of the operation of SES Amyntaio Units, following their relevant environmental upgrading for the decade 2021-2030. For the operation of the Units as they are, under the known limited operating regime, there is a sufficient portion of the deposit that has not been affected by the landslide and its extraction is already carried out using the contractor's equipment and company's equipment. It is noted that the deposit of the Amyntaio Mine before the landslide corresponded to 5-7% of PPC's total deposits. Moreover, for the supply of SES Amyntaio, the exploitation of the adjacent Lakkias' deposit has already begun by using contractors' equipment. The Report on the causes of the landslide was completed and submitted by the professor's Committee of NTUA and AUTH and by the managers and former managers of PPC. The main conclusions are that, the landslide was caused by a confluence of many factors and that this is not a typical phenomenon, in the sense that it is not caused by common factors that lead to mines' landslides. Also in the framework of ensuring safe conditions within the area of Amyntaion mine and its surrounding area and in order to restart mining operations in the area of the recent landslide, the findings on the landslide's causes continue to be evaluated. More specifically, based on the findings on the landslide's causes and in accordance with the rules of Art and Science, the Company has taken the following actions:
· A preliminary geotechnical report has been prepared to ensure the above-mentioned safe conditions under which the mine recovery works have already begun.
· Thirty-five (35) exploration drills have been performed in the landslide area to investigate the geometric spread of the field and to judge its viability after the occurrence of the phenomenon. The survey is still in

progress. An amendment to the Technical Memorandum on Mine Reopening has been submitted to the House of Inspection of Environment, Building, Energy and Mines of Greece (SEPDEM). It will be followed by the preparation and submission of a new Technical Study, after the approval of the new Environmental Terms for the Operation of the mine, which will include the exploitation planning of the field on the basis of the newest geological and geotechnical data that will result from the above study. Finally with regard to the expropriation and relocation of the Anargyri Village : PPC S.A. in compliance with paragraph 2 of Article 28 of Law 3337/2011, as subsequently amended by article 147 of Law 4495/2017, set up a committee for the preparation of the planned relocation of the village. The draft plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Energy until April 30th, 2018. Regarding the expropriation of Anargyri village, it is noted that according to Law 4495/2017 is defined that " the forced expropriation is in favor and on the Greek State's expense". PPC S.A. although it does not have a decisive jurisdiction, will proceed with all the procedures required for the compulsory expropriation and relocation of the Anargyri Village to the part that corresponds to the Company, under the existing legal framework.

NOTES TO THE UNBUNDLED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General Information
According to the provisions of European Directive 2009/72/EC, as well as the provisions of L. 4001/2011, which integrates the aforementioned European Directive into the national legislation, unbundling is the separation of financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) of an integrated electric utility into different financial statements for each one of its activities. The unbundled financial statements will reflect each activity's financial position, assets and liabilities, as if such activities prepared financial statements had they been separate (independent) legal entities. PPC, as a vertically organized integrated electric utility, keeps in its internal accounting, separate accounts for its activities and prepares separate balance sheets and statements of income for each one of its activities (balance sheet and statement of income before tax ­ hereinafter referred to as "unbundled financial statements"), as if these activities were carried out by different entities, in order to avoid discriminations, cross subsidization and distortion of competition. Further to the above, PPC should keep separate accounts for its activities carried out in the non-interconnected islands. The accounting principles applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements are those applied for the preparation of the Company's separate and consolidated financial statements. The unbundling methodology applied by the Company for the preparation of the accompanied unbundled financial statements was approved by the 266/2014 Decision of the Regulatory Authority for Energy. Additionaly, in the Non ­ Interconnected System the transactions of energy between PPC's Generation and Supply and HEDNO, are carried out according to RAE's Decision 641/2013. It is noted that as of 15/6/2017, IPTO does not belong to the Group's subsidiaries and follows the model of ownership unbundled Operator, fully harmonized with the Directive 2009/72/EC. As a result, information disclosures by operational segment are stated and refer only to continuing operations of the Company.
2. Accounting Unbundling Methodology
The methodology applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements consists of the following phases: (a) determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled, (b) preparation of unbundled trial balances, (c) preparation of unbundled balance sheets, (d) preparation of the unbundled statements of income, (e) quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an internal pricing system. Determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled The activities for unbundled financial statements are prepared, on a first level, are Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply, and Corporate. On a second level, these activities are presented as follows: · Interconnected System
- Mines - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
258

financial report

· System of Crete - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
· System of Non Interconnected Islands - Generation - Distribution network - Supply
Mines Mines include the lignite extraction activity carried out in the Lignite Centers of West Macedonia and Megalopolis. Generation Generation includes the electricity generation activities in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands. Distribution Distribution Network includes the rental of assets to HEDNO SA in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands. Supply Supply reflects the Company's activity which monitors relationships with final customers in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands. Corporate The Corporate is the adninistrative departments of the Parent Company, which provide support to PPC's activities. The Balance Sheet and Statement of Income of the Corporate is further allocated based on certain allocation rules, which are described in detail in the following pages. Related parties are reflected as a separate activity in the group unbundled financial statements. Preparation of unbundled trial balances In the Company's accounting system, each cost and profit centre represents an organizational entity, in which the assets and liabilities are recorded. In order for these trial balances to be generated, the following tasks are performed, which are applied per account and cost / profit centre for the minimum account degree in General Accounting: · C ost/profit centers are recorded in order to identify the boundaries of activities and then all cost/profit centers to
be assigned to activities with which they are related to. · The sum totals of the cost/profit centers and accounts are reconciled with the comprehensive trial balance of the
Company.
259

annual report 2017

part b

· T he trial balance accounts are codified and grouped into sections of the balance sheet and of the income statement based on Company's consolidated Financial Statements.
Preparation of unbundled balance sheets
At the end of each financial year, balance sheets are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System. The balance sheet for each activity is prepared under the principle of independent accounting. The accounts of each balance sheet are as follows:
i. Direct, which include the direct charges and credits of the accounts of the relevant profit centers of the corresponding level of activity.
ii. Indirect of the administration departments, which derive from the administration departments of each activity and include its allocated balance sheet accounts.
iii. Indirect of the Corporate, which include the allocated balance sheet accounts, which are presented in a separate line on each activity's balance sheet.
In addition, in the accounts of balance sheets there are profitable Activities where funding other Activities for their needs in cash equivalents. The presentation of these transactions reflected in separately lines in the accounts of balance sheet in current assets and current liabilities. Additionaly, the Balance Sheets of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately.
Preparation of the unbundled statements of income For each accounting period income statements are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System. Additionaly, the Income Statemetns of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately. Income statement accounts of financial nature are allocated to activities based on the loans of each activity. Then, income statement account balances that have remained in Corporate are allocated in the activities. For the allocation of revenues and expenses to Activities the criterion is based on direct expenses of every Activity, with the exception of expenses that relate to the system of customers' monitoring and billing that are assigned only to Supply. Upon completion of the above allocations, the Statements of income for each Activity are prepared. The Corporate expenses and revenues allocated to the activities are presented separately in a line item in each activity.
Quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an internal pricing system
Within the framework of an integrated utility products and services are exchanged among its activities, which would be recorded if these activities would operate as independent entities. In order for these products and services to be quantified and recorded, an internal pricing system is applied if necessary (where there is no external determination of internal exchanges). The most important services and products internally exchanged in PPC among its Activities, that are presented in the Unbundled Financial Statements are the following:

* Be in effect only for 2016. For 2017 the charges and revenues from PSOs are been billed by the Operators of the Market.

Each activity's revenues from product sales or services to another activity are quantified, through the internal pricing system. Also, the activity that receives the product/ service records the related cost.
The internal revenues ­ expenses for each activity are defined as follows:
In the interconnected system:
· T he internal energy sales for self-consumption are calculated based on each Activity's metered consumption of energy with the average marginal price including the Return of receivable Public Service Obligations, Transmission System Tariffs and IPTO uplift charge.
·T he Mines internal revenue is calculated in accordance of the agreement for the lignite supply between Mines and Generation. The lignite supply contract determines the internal lignite market, i.e the lignite sales of the activity of the Lignite General Division to the activity of the Generation General Division. The contract covers the consumption of the lignite stations on a continuous basis, as well as with the necessary stock for the specific period. The calculation of the relative amounts takes place on the monthly basis, taking into account the monthly consumption and the calorific value of the lignite delivered.
In the Non-Interconnected system:
· T he internal energy sales are calculated based on each activity's metered consumption of energy priced by the average revenue of PPC's tariffs for the sale of electricity to Medium Voltage for Industrial Use customers.
·The Public Service Obligations (PSOs) that are invoiced by Supply to its customers, third party PSOs as well as self consumption PSOs are allocated as an internal revenue of Crete and the Non Interconected Islands` Supply. Additionaly Supply receives as revenue electricity sales (self consumptions) to Generation (internal expense).
