Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Shareholders,
2016 was another year of deep transformation of the Agora Group: restructuring of the press business and development of nonpress operations. This drove the continuing upward trend of the Group's revenue and a satisfactory operating result at the end of 2016. This is a halfway mark and another milestone for the successful implementation of the "Development Plan for the Upcoming Years" announced in March 2014. We are happy that the initiatives that we have been consistently implementing for 3 years are bearing good results and allow some of the Group's businesses post record-breaking performance figures.
The Press Segment is successfully continuing the digital transformation process. At the end of 2016, the number of active paid subscriptions to Gazeta Wyborcza was almost 100 thousand. The Magazines division posted a dynamic increase in sales of advertising services, among others through the implementation of e-commerce solutions for selected services. It is a good sign, which confirms that the method used to change the business model of our press business has been selected correctly. At the same time, we struggled with exceptionally difficult trends on the printed press market. We let go of some of our employees and decided to discontinue publication of two of our titles.
Despite the challenges that we faced as an organization in 2016, the performance of the Agora Group has confirmed that the development strategy we have been implementing is effective. 2016 was a record-breaking year for Helios, both in terms of revenue and result. This is without a doubt an effect of the consistent policy of investing on the cinema market. This is why we want to continue to develop the Helios cinema chain. We will also develop film distribution and production operations. In early 2017 we have already seen spectacular success driven by the immense popularity of the movies opening in cinemas, including Sztuka Kochania. The story of Michalina Wislocka.
On the outdoor advertising market, the Agora Group continues to focus on consolidating its leading position on the premium panels segment. In 2017, we will complete the contract to build 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw. This is a groundbreaking project in outdoor advertising in Poland, which significantly changes this market, while AMS achieves its business objectives way ahead of time and much above the assumptions. It ended last year with the best result in its history and it is working on similar projects in other cities in Poland.
For the Group's Internet business, the priority is to grow in the fastest-growing segments of the Internet market. We want to invest in content, new formats and mobile applications. We are pushing the development of the video and programmatic areas. Our portal, Gazeta.pl, ranks first in terms of presence in social media and our growth investments are yielding measurable benefits. This is exemplified by Yieldbird, which grows very fast, also outside of Poland, significantly improving its revenues and profits.
The key objective for our radio business is to improve its profitability. At the same time, we are implementing an effective development strategy. Radio Pogoda, launched in 2015, has quickly gained huge audience and last year all the Agora Radio Group stations posted the highest daily reach figures in history.
We are successfully operating on the television market. Stopklatka TV, which we are developing with a partner, passed the 1percent viewing rate threshold and broke even. On 2 December 2016, we launched our first TV channel, METRO, on the 8th digital terrestrial television multiplex. Since its launch, METRO has posted the best figures among all other MUX-8 channels. We have successfully acquired a globally renowned company as a partner for the METRO channel.
Agora's priority remains the successful transformation of the press activity. The change of the business model of the press segment is based on two main foundations: improving the profitability of our papers in their traditional form and building and monetizing a solid base of digital subscriptions. Another objective that we pursue in this process is to reach 110 thousand active paid digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza by the end of 2017. However, our main objective is to boost average revenue per digital newspaper subscription and proceeds from advertising and Internet services on the websites related to Agora's press titles.
One of the goals announced by the Group was to maintain profitability of the Print segment. We did not manage to achieve that goal in 2016. It is the Management Board's ambition to improve the performance of this segment in 2017. The Group is taking effective measures to reduce the costs of shared services and infrastructure. In 2016, optimization efforts allowed us to get closer to that target.
To conclude, we can see the positive effects of our development plans, despite the additional challenges we had to face. We are successfully adapting our offering to the requirements of the fast-paced press market and we continue to increase revenues from alternative sources.

We believe that the consistent implementation of the entire "Development Plan for the Upcoming Years" will underline its transforming effects for the entire Agora Group, improve the Group's results and increase its shareholder value. While we pursue our business and financial goals, we want to be the first and obvious choice for our users and partners, who are supplied by our media and undertakings with reliable information, quality journalism, exciting entertainment or innovative solutions to reach their customer base effectively. I would like to express my gratitude to all: shareholders, customers and employees, for your support and trust in Agora, and to our daily readers, users and audience for your interest and loyalty. Bartosz Hojka President of the Management Board of Agora S.A.

(g) Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 31 March 2017.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union.
Information about standards and interpretations, which were published and become effective after the balance sheet date, including those awaiting endorsement by the European Union, is presented in point (ae).
(b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures. All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its Group would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the Company or the Group from continuing their business operations.
The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2015, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2016 the following amendments to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effective:
1) Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans - Employee Contributions; 2) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012; 3) Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations; 4) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation; 5) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements to IFRS 2012-2014; 6) Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture - Bearer Plants; 7) Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements; 8) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure initiative.
The application of the above amendments had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In 2016 the Group changed the name of the line item in the consolidated balance sheet from ,,Accounts payable" to ,,Trade and other payables". The scope of balances presented in this line item did not change. In Company`s opinion, the new name reflects more accurately the information scope of this line item. The same change was applied to the unconsolidated balance sheet of the Company.
Adjustments to comparative information
In 2016, the Group modified the presentation of expenses related to rental cost of advertising space in internet business. Till the end of 2015 these costs were presented in the consolidated income statement in the line item "Selling expenses" and starting from the first quarter of 2016 these costs are presented in the line item "Cost of sales".

In the Company`s opinion, the new presentation more appropriately reflects the nature of these costs from the perspective of classification of expenses according to their function. The comparative amounts were adequately adjusted. The above change had no impact on previously reported amounts of operating profit, net profit and equity of the Group.
The summary of adjustments made to the consolidated comparative amounts of the Group is presented in the table below:

Cost of sales Gross profit Selling expenses

2015 (as reported)
(795,591) 393,749 (260,088)

Presentation adjustments
(24,553) (24,553) 24,553

2015 (as adjusted)
(820,144) 369,196 (235,535)

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities, which are controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group due to its involvement in an investee is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group has power over an investee when the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, ie the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.
The acquitision method of accounting is applied to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control commences until the date that control ceases to exist. Contingent consideration is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the value of the contingent payment liability is recognised through the income statement Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
(ii) Joint ventures and associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and other shareholders on the basis of a statute, company's act or other agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases to exist. The investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. An interest in a joint venture or associate is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture or associate. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the joint venture.

(iv) Put options granted to non-controlling interests

When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equal to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point w).

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is usually as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 5 - 8 years 2 - 20 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, except for some special projects related to distribution and co-operation rights for movies and computer games, in case of which the consumption of economic benefits may significantly differ from the straight line approach and the pattern of consumption of economic benefits in particular periods can be reliably determined based on generated revenue and it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets (apart from acquired magazine titles) are usually between 2 and 15 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Internally generated intangible assets comprise expenditure related to developing computer software and internet applications, including costs of employee benefits, which can be directly allocated to the development phase of an internal project. During the development phase and after its completion the internally generated intangible assets are assessed whether there are indications of impairment according to the accounting policy described in point w.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash in transit and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised. At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses, whether there is objective evidence of impairment of financial assets. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset`s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted with the effective interest rate. Changes in impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.

(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses. Inventories comprise goods for resale, materials, finished goods and work in progress, including production cost of own movies.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i) Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii) Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii) Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv) Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses, including reserve capital accumulated from prior years profits. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as described below and the recognition of the put option given to the non-controlling shareholders.
In the Agora Group the share incentive plans based on Agora S.A.'s shares were carried out, which ended in the first half of 2013. According to these plans, which were share-based payments settled in financial instruments, eligible employees were entitled to purchase investment certificates in closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates was determined by applying valuation model, which took into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates was included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates was established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates were purchased. The costs were recognized over the vesting period.

(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.
Deferred income tax is provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method. Changes in the value of the liability are recognized in profit or loss, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.

(t) Grants for the acquisition of fixed assets
The grants received for financing the acquisition of fixed assets are recognized, when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto. The grants are initially recognised at fair value as deferred income and credited to the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.

(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).
(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment

charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over its useful life, but no longer than the lease term. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets as described in point (d).
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.

(z) Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
Within the Agora Group there are Incentive Plans carried out, described in note 27. One of the components of the plans is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. These are cash-settled plans with rules based on - inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In this plans, members of the Management Board of the Company are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The value of the provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are included in staff costs.
(ab) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac) Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.

(ad) Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operated in a Special Economic Zone till 8 August 2016. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption was recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ad) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2016 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
The Standard provides a framework that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in IFRS. Under the new standard, entities will apply a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue, and at what amount. The model specifies that revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognized over time, in a manner that depicts the entity's performance or at a point in time, when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Standard includes new qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements to enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The Group has started the processs of assessing the impact that the application of the main provisions of the new standard may have on the consolidated financial statements. The initial analysis aimed to identify significant contracts,which might include elements influencing the timing or amount of revenue recognised during a reporting period, in particular in relation to multiple-element arrangements, licence agreements, customer bonuses or services provided with the engagement of subcontractors. On the basis of the initial analysis, the Group assesses that the initial application of the standard, starting on 1 January 2018, will have no material impact the timing or amount of revenue recognised in the consolidated financial statements. In 2017 the analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 will be continued and the Group will disclose material changes to this assessment in the financial statements for the following reporting periods.
2) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later).
The new standard replaces the guidance included in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a model for calculating impairment losses. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of three categories:
- financial assets measured at amortized cost;
- financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or
- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).
The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. In respect of the financial assets impairment requirements, IFRS 9 replaces the "incurred loss" impairment model in IAS 39 with an "expected credit loss" model. Under the new approach, it will no longer be necessary for a loss event to occur before an impairment allowance is recognized.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016 or later, however the European Commission decided to defer the endorsement indefinitely).
The Amendments remove the acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is contributed to an associate or a joint venture concerning the recognition of profit or loss on the loss of control of subsidiary and require a full gain or loss to be recognised when the assets transferred meet the definition of a business under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
2) Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 or later).

The amendments clarify that unrealized losses related to debt instruments measured at fair value in the financial statements, but whose tax base is their original cost, can give rise to deductible temporary differences. The amendments also give more guidance on assessing whether taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences could be utilized.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3) Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows - Diclosure initiative (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 or later)
Pursuant to the amendments, an entity shall provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. One way to fulfil the above disclosure requirement is by providing a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities.
The Group expects, that the application of the amendments may result in additional disclosures of changes in financing liabilities as required by the amendments.

4) Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
The amendments, claryfing how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions, provide requirements on the accounting for: ·the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments; ·share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations; and ·a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled.
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
5) Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance contracts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later) The amendments provide for the scope of applying IFRS 4 after IFRS 9 becomes effective.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
6) Amendments to IFRS - Improvements 2014-2016 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later, except for the changes to IFRS 12 that shall be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017) Annual changes to IFRS that contain amendments to 3 standards (IFRS 1, IFRS 12 and IAS 28).
The Group does not expect, that the amendments will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later) The Amendments provide clarification on transfers to, or from, investment properties. A transfer into, or out of investment property should be made only when there has been a change in use of the property and such a change in use would involve an assessment of whether the property qualifies as an investment property.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
8) IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or later)
IFRIC 22 provides requirements about which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance and clarifies that the transaction date is the date on which the company initially recognises the prepayment or deferred income arising from the advance consideration. For transactions involving multiple payments or receipts, each payment or receipt gives rise to a separate transaction date.

The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group already applies accounting policy consistent with these requirements.

9) IFRS 16 Leasing (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later)
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. The Standard eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees and instead requires companies to bring most leases on-balance sheet under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Bringing operating leases in balance sheet will result in recognizing a new asset ­ the right to use the underlying asset ­ and a new liability ­ the obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This will result in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when they pay constant annual rentals.
Lessor accounting, however, shall remain largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases will be retained.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements.

c) Property, plant and equipment held for sale as at the balance sheet date

As at 31 December 2016, non-current assets with the carrying amount of PLN 10,682 thousand were presented as held for sale and comprised perpetual usufruct rights to plot of land located at the Czerniakowska Street in Warsaw. In the segment information provided in note 21 those assets are presented within reconciling positions.
As at 31 December 2016, the actions to sell the assets have already been initiated and a sale is expected to be completed within the period shorter than 12 months from the balance sheet date. The Management Board estimates that the fair value less costs to sell of those assets is higher than their carrying amount.
On December 16, 2016 the Company signed a preliminary agreement for the sale of perpetual usufruct rights to an undeveloped plot of land with a total area of 6,270 square meters located at the Czerniakowska Street 85/87, Warsaw ("the Preliminary Agreement"). The Preliminary Agreement requires the Company to conclude the promised conditional agreement of sale of the property by October 31, 2017 ("the Conditional Agreement"). The Conditional Agreement shall be commercial in nature with binding effects, concluded under the condition that the Mayor of

Warsaw shall not execute the pre-emption right to the property ("the Condition"). In the case of fulfillment of the Condition, an agreement transferring the rights to the property shall be concluded by the Company. The Preliminary Agreement established a parties' contractual right to withdraw from the agreement in cases referred to in the Preliminary Agreement (including the buyers' right to withdraw from the agreement in the event of changes in the legal or factual state of the property). The net selling price of the property amounts to PLN 19,000 thousand, and the positive influence of this transaction on the Company's and Agora Group's operating result in 2017 shall amount to ca. PLN 8,318 thousand.
d) Sale of property in Lodz

On October 27, 2016 Agora S.A. has entered into a conditional agreement with the sale of the right of perpetual usufruct of two properties of total area of ca. 4.2 thou. square meters located in Lodz, together with the ownership of the buildings erected on one of them, including a historic office building with covered area of ca. 1 thou. square meters (referred to collectively as "the Property"). The agreement was concluded under the condition that the Mayor of Lodz shall not exercise the right of first refusal to the Property vested in the Municipality of the City of Lodz.
The decision to sell the Property stems from the fact that the Company does not utilize effectively the entire Property for its operations. The Company believes that the optimal solution shall be to lease office space adapted to the current scale of operations of the Company in Lodz. Along with the conditional sale agreement, a conditional agreement was settled to lease office space, under which Agora will lease from the buyer office space located in the Property for the period of 5 years.
On December 2, 2016 the Company obtained information that the Mayor of Lodz will not exercise the pre-emotive right to the Property vested in the Municipality of the City of Lodz and consequently, on December 8, 2016 the agreement concerning transfer of the rights to the Property was executed.
The net selling price of the Property amounted to PLN 9,700 thousand and its impact on the other operating income of the Company and Agora Group from gains on disposal of non-financial non-current assets for the fourth quarter of 2016 amounted to PLN 5,991 thousand.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996. IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Company to be restated by applying the general price index. Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Company with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount. Consequently, the restatement of share capital due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Company, only the structure of the equity is affected. Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies).

Consequently, due to lack of impact on equity of the Company following the hyperinflationary adjustment and lack of regulations in polish law, the Company did not post any adjustment to equity as a consequence of IAS 29 application.

(i) Provision for restructuring
On October 4, 2016, the Management Board of Agora S.A.: (i) adopted a resolution concerning initiation of the consultation on group layoffs with the trade unions operating at Agora S.A. and the Company's works council, (ii) requested the trade unions operating at the Company and the Company's works council to join in the consultation on collective redundancy process, (iii) provided the relevant Labor Office with information on the intention to execute group layoffs in the Company.
On October 11, 2016, Agora S.A concluded a trilateral agreement ("Agreement") with trade unions operating at Agora S.A. (the Agreement fulfills the provisions of article 3, Section 1 of the Act of March 13th, 2003 on Special Rules for Termination of Employment for Reasons Not Attributable to Employees) and with works council in the Company (which constitutes an agreement in accordance with the Act of April 7th, 2006 on informing and consulting employees) and the Management Board of the Company adopted a resolution regarding execution of the group layoffs in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.
On December 6, 2016 the Management Board of Agora S.A. adopted a resolution to launch consultation procedure regarding increase in the number of people included in group layoffs in Agora S.A. In accordance with the Agreement, the reduction of employment in the Company would involve no more than 135 people and was to be carried till December 31, 2016. The intention of the Management Board of Agora SA was to increase the number of people covered by group layoffs from 135 to ca. 190 employees in Agora SA (9.6% of employees in the Company as on December 6,2016).
On December 12, 2016 the Company concluded an annex to the Agreement ("the Annex") and the Management Board of the Company adopted resolutions: -approving the Annex and execution of the group layoffs in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, -granting consent to sign by the Company of a letter of intent with Organizacja Midzyzakladowa NSZZ "Solidarnosc"
Agora S.A. i Inforadio Sp. z o.o. regarding intention to work out by the parties of the rules regarding voluntary redundancy in "Gazeta Wyborcza" in the event that reduction of employment in "Gazeta Wyborcza" in 2017 is needed.
In accordance with the Annex, the number of people affected by group layoffs grew from ca. 135 to not more than 190. The Company, in accordance with the law requirements, submitted the relevant documentation, together with the Annex, to a relevant Labor Office.
In accordance with the Agreement, the laid-off employees are provided by the Company with a wider range of supportive measures than it is required by the law. The redundancy payment provided for in the law regulations will be increased by an additional indemnity in the amount equal to one additional monthly salary. The laid-off employees shall be supported by additional protective measures provided by the Company inter alia, help in searching for new job or reskilling.
Management Board of Agora S.A., in the process of transformation, made a decision of ceasing the publication of the free daily newspaper "Metrocafe.pl" on 14 October 2016. The reason for taking the restructuring measures, is ongoing market recession visible in press advertising expenditure and negative forecasts of its further development. The Company's Management Board decided to focus on the development of "Gazeta Wyborcza", particularly its further development in digitization and support of the development of paid subscriptions.
The total cost of the provision set up in relation to the reduction of employment amounted to PLN 6,906 thousand and burdened the Company's and Group's operating results in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As at 31 December 2016, the total provision outstanding for usage amounted to PLN 5,730 thousand.
(ii) Provision for penalties, interests and similar
Provision for penalties, interests and similar includes mainly penalties for putting advertising panels on the waysides by the companies of the AMS group.

(iii) Provision for onerous contracts
Provision for onerous contracts was recognised by the subsidiary Helios S.A. based on the analysis of the settlement of a long-term operating lease contract concerning one of the cinema locations within the Helios network.
(iv) Provision for legal claims
The Group is a defendant in court cases. As at 31 December 2016 the Group evaluated the risk of loss and payment of indemnities in those cases. The amount of indemnities was determined based on consultation with Group's lawyers taking into account the present status of those cases and information available. Additionally, the companies of the Group are a party of legal disputes in the amount of PLN 3,080 thousand (as at December 31, 2015: PLN 2,573 thousand), in cases when the Management Board estimates the probability of loss for less than 50%. Such disputes are contingent liabilities.

Operating segments are components of the Group, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in the process of decision making regarding allocation of resources and assessing the performance of the Group.
For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services.
The Group activities are divided into six reportable operating segments as follows:

27. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
a)Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2013-2015
Starting from the third quarter 2013, Management Board members of the Company participated in an incentive program for the period of 2013-2015 ("Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan").
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members were specified in the Supervisory Board resolutions.
Till the end of 2014 the Three -Year-Long Incentive Plan was based on two components: the stage of realisation of the financial result ("the EBITDA target") and the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase").
In 2014, due to the fulfillment of the condition concerning the achievement of certain EBITDA level of the Agora Group (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation), the Three -Year-Long Incentive Plan was modified so that, starting from the first quarter of 2015, the potential reward resulting from the Three -Year-Long Incentive Plan was based only on the percent of Company's share price increase. As a result, the liability relating to the EBITDA target component of the Plan accumulated so far has been reversed and credited to the Income Statement in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The value of potential reward resulting from the component based on the percent of Company's share price increase was charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the full vesting period of the Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan, that is from the third quarter of 2013 till the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with its assumptions, Three -Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2013-2015 was settled in cash in the second quarter of 2016. The realization of the plan resulted in the total payment of PLN 1,628 thousand.

a) Incentive Plan for years 2016-2017
Starting from the second quarter 2016, Management Board members of the Company participate in a new incentive program, on the basis of which, they will be eligible to receive an annual bonus based on two components described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The EBITDA target is specified as the EBITDA result (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation) to be reached in the given financial year determined by the Supervisory Board. The amount of potential bonus depends on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the given financial year;
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the Incentive Plan will depend on the percent of Company's share price increase in the future. The share price increase will be calculated as a difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the first quarter of the financial year commencing after the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IQ") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the fourth quarter of the financial year preceding the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IVQ"). If the Average Share Price IQ will be lower than the Average Share Price IVQ, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan will not be granted.
The bonus from the Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of a non-market condition, which is the continuation of holding the post of the Management Board member during the year, for which the bonus is due.
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for the Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are specified in the Supervisory Board resolution.
As at 31 December 2016, the fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target for 2016 and was charged to the Income Statement.
The fair value of the potential reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2016, the value was charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the vesting period of the Incentive Plan.
The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the estimated cost of the Incentive Plan charged to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:

The minority shareholder of the GoldenLine remains G.C. Geek Code Ltd, controlled by Mariusz Gralewski - the main founder of GoldenLine. G.C. Geek Code Ltd holds 22 shares in GoldenLine, which represented 11% of the share capital and gives the right to 22 votes at the general meeting of shareholders and represented 11% of the votes at the general meeting of shareholders. The sale agreement provided that after the transaction principles of cooperation between Agora and G.C. Geek Code shall be stated. In case there is no agreement in this respect, G.C. Geek Code will be entitled to sell its shares in the share capital of the Company to Agora, within 3 months from the date of the share purchase agreement, the terms and conditions being the same as in the contract of January 25, 2016.

(1) According to IFRS 3, the Group measured the acquired intangible assets of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. at their acquisition-date fair value and recognized three intangible assets, which met the condition of identifiability under IFRS 3, and have been not presented up till now in the balance sheet of the company, that is: the GoldenLine domain, the value of IT software & technology and the user database, whose total fair value amounted to PLN 18,740 thousand.

According to IFRS 3, the Group remeasured its pre-existing 36% equity interest in the company to its fair value as at the acquisition date, which resulted in a loss of PLN 5,537 thousand (being PLN 5,760 thousand less PLN 11,297 thousand carrying amount of the equity-accounted investee at the date of acquisition). The loss on the remeasurement of previously held equity interest was recognized as finance cost in the consolidated income statement of Agora Group for the first quarter of 2016.
Simultaneously, the identificable net assets measured at fair value as at the acquisition date exceeded the aggregate amount of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair value of pre-existing equity interest in the company and the value of the non-controlling interests and the Group recognized the resulting gain on a bargain purchase in the amount of PLN 2,228 thousand, which was included in other operating income in the consolidated income statement of Agora Group for the first quarter of 2016.
As a result, the total negative impact of the acquisition of the company GoldenLine on the consolidated net result of the Agora Group in the first quarter of 2016 amounted to PLN 3,309 thousand.
The fair value of the acquired trade receivables amounted to PLN 1,948 thousand. The gross contractual amounts of acquired trade receivables was PLN 2,100 thousand, of which PLN 152 thousand was expected to be uncollectible.
The acquisition-related costs of PLN 98 thousand have been expensed and were included in administrative expenses in the income statement of the Agora Group for the first quarter of 2016.
From the date of acquisition till December 31, 2016, GoldenLine has contributed revenues of PLN 17,554 thousand and a net loss of PLN 757 thousand to the consolidated revenues and net profit of the Agora Group.
The right granted to the non-controlling shareholder to sell his remaining equity interest in the company to Agora ("put option") meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 and was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of Agora Group at its redemption amount amounting to PLN 1,760 thousand as at the acquisition date. According to the Group accounting policy, at the initial recognition, the value of this liability decreased the line retained earnings within the Group`s equity.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2016 and for the year period ended thereon

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, granted loans and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 % of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
The ageing of overdue trade receivables as at balance sheet date is presented in note 9.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by diversification of its investments in investment funds, which invest in different classes of debt instruments. The Group does not acquire securities directly, but only through investment funds. At the same time, the Company invest only in liquid securities.
Collaterals
The maximum exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of financial instruments.
The information related to collaterals held is described in note 35.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2016 and for the year period ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2016, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 14.
In addition, the Group was a participant of the agreement regarding the implementation of liquidity management system within the Group ("the Cash Pooling Agreement"). The agreement was signed on December 5, 2014 between Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. and the following companies from the Group: Agora S.A., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o., Agora TC Sp. z o.o., Grupa Radiowa Agory Sp. z o.o., Doradztwo Mediowe Sp. z o.o., Inforadio Sp. z o.o., IM40 Sp. z o.o., Yeildbird Sp. z o.o. (since August 7,2015), Green Content Sp. z o.o. (since February 19,2016 r.) and Optimizers Sp. z o.o. (since April 8, 2016 r.). The Cash Pooling Agreement aims to optimize cash liquidity and the most efficient management of cash for entities participating in the cash pooling system. Agora S.A. acts as a cash pool leader within the system. Intra-group balances and transactions related to cash pooling agreemet are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, during 2015 the Group used services of factoring with a recourse on the basis of an agreement signed between AMS S.A. and mFaktoring S.A. with a financing limit of PLN 15,000 thousand. The agreement was secured by a blank promissory note issued by AMS S.A. and guaranteed by Adpol Sp. z o.o. On 23 December 2015 the factoring agreement was terminated.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to sales of printing services to foreign customers, purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises, which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,653 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2015: PLN 396 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 6,263 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2015: PLN 8,530 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 3,010 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2015: PLN 6,659 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to 6 months.
In 2016, Agora S.A. was not engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).
Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.

Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans and cash pooling liabilities). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2016, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the impact of changes in fair value of financial instruments is estimated at the level of net loss/profit of PLN 525 thousand (as at December 31, 2015: PLN 546 thousand).
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables, payables). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2016, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to impact the net profit/loss in the amount of PLN 391 thousand (as at December 31, 2015: PLN 171 thousand).
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.

3) Fair value hierarchy for financial instruments

The Group applies the following hierarchy for disclosing information about fair value of financial instruments ­ by valuation technique:
- level 1: quoted prices in active markets (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities; - level 2: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are observable, directly or indirectly, market data; - level 3: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are not based on observable market data.

The table below shows financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date:

(1) in 2016 relates to a call to purchase 0.38% shares of Helios S.A. exercised by a non-controlling shareholder pursuant to the provisions of an option agreement dated August 31, 2010;

(2) relates to a call to pay an additional price for the shares sold by a former non-controlling shareholder of Helios S.A pursuant to the provisions of a share sale agreement dated December 11, 2014.

Key assumptions that are most significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include: estimated level of the EBITDA result (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation) during the period specified in put option conditions and discount rate. In case of the put option granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., an increase of the estimated EBITDA level over the period specified in put option conditions by 10%, would cause an increase of put option liability by ca PLN 2,400 thousand, while an increase of the discount rate by 1pp, would cause a decrease of the liability by ca PLN 1,200 thousand.
4) Cash flows related to financial liabilities

amount of PLN 8.0 million was returned to the company. Consequently, as at 31 December 2016 the deposit receivable amounts to PLN 21.6 million ( out of which PLN 10.8 million is presented within long-term receivables).

Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to PLN 673 thousand in 2016 and PLN 727 thousand in 2015.

38. COMMITMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases (including the lease of outdoor locations for advertising panels, Helios cinemas, buildings and other) are summarised as follows:

advertising and printing services, rent of machinery, office and other fixed assets, providing various services: legal, financial, administration, trade, sharing market research results, outsorcing, grant and repayment of loans and interest revenues and costs, dividend distribution, cash pooling settlements.
Transactions within the Agora Group are carried out on arm's length basis and are within the normal business activities of companies.

41. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the value in use for the relevant cash generating units was determined.
There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and
2) pre-tax discount rate.

AGORA GROUP MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(MD&A) FOR YEAR OF 2016 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REVENUE PLN 1 198.4 MILLION NET LOSS PLN 13.2 MILLION EBITDA PLN 114.9 MILLION
OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 97.0 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2016, while comparisons refer to 2015. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP [1]
In 2016, the Group's revenue amounted to PLN 1,198.4 million and increased by 0.8% yoy. The increase in the Group's revenue in this period resulted primarily from an increase in the inflows of the Movies and Books, Internet, Outdoor and Radio segments. However, revenue of the Press and Print segments was lower yoy. In the period January­December 2016, the most dynamic increase in revenue was recorded in the Internet segment -- by 11.6% yoy, to PLN 167.9 million. Another segment characterised by high revenue growth dynamics was the Outdoor segment. From the beginning of the year to the end of December 2016, total revenue of the segment amounted to PLN 168.0 million, increasing by 7.6% yoy. Total revenue of the Movies and Books segment amounted to PLN 364.0 million in 2016 -- an increase by 5.5% yoy. This was mainly thanks to high attendance in Helios cinemas, which translated into an increase in the revenue from both ticket sales as well as concession sales. However, income on the Agora's Publishing House activity was lower than in 2015, primarily due to lower income associated with the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its add ons. Income on film activity was also lower yoy due to lower number of sold tickets for movies distributed by NEXT FILM. Revenue of the Radio segment also increased -- by 5.3% yoy, amounting to PLN 113.4 million. The revenue of the Press segment decreased by 10.9% yoy to PLN 267.9 million. This decline resulted primarily from lower advertising revenue in that segment, the free Metrocafe.pl daily no longer being issued as well as lower income on copy sales. On the other hand, higher income on sale of advertising in online services of magazines had positive impact on the level of revenue in this segment. The revenue of the Print segment amounted to PLN 155.5 million and decreased by 5.6% yoy mainly due to lower volume of orders.
In 2016, the Group's operating costs increased by 0.9% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,181.7 million. The highest dynamics in the increase in operating costs -- up by 14.7% yoy to PLN 144.9 million, was recorded in the Internet segment. This resulted mainly from higher costs related to brokerage of advertising space of thirdparty internet publishers, as well as higher staff costs and consolidation of GoldenLine. The increase in operating costs in the Radio segment by 6.7% yoy to PLN 100.6 million was mainly the result of the higher costs of promotion and marketing, higher costs related with brokerage activities in Helios cinemas, as well as higher staff costs. The increase in operating costs in the Movies and Books segment -- up by 4.8% yoy to PLN 337.0 million, is mainly related to higher costs of film copy purchase and the development of the Helios network. In the Outdoor segment, the increase in operating costs up to PLN 143.1 million results from higher staff costs as well as higher costs of advertising campaigns due to their higher number. The costs of the Print segment slightly increased and remained at a similar level to costs from 2015. The Press segment recorded significantly decreased operating costs as a result of a reduction in all cost categories. The most significant decreases took place for the following items: materials, energy, goods and printing services as well as staff costs. Costs in the Press segment were also reduced due to the Metrocafe.pl daily being no longer issued.

It should be noted that in 2016, the Group's results were affected by one-off events. The Group's operating result in the fourth quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the provision related to the group lay-off process implemented at Agora S.A., which was charged to the operating result at the EBIT level in the amount of PLN 6.9 million. However, the Group's operating profit was positively affected by gains from sale of the Company's real property in Lodz, amounting to PLN 6.0 million and from sale of shares in the subsidiary, Green Content Sp. z o.o., amounting to PLN 10.5 million. Additionally, it should be noted that the Group's net result decreased by PLN 7.1 million financial costs due to the standard, compliant with the rules specified in the accounting policy of the Agora Group, revaluation of liabilities due to put options granted to non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries. Apart from one-off events recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Group's results throughout 2016 were affected by the acquisition of 106 shares in the share capital of GoldenLine from this company's shareholders for a total price of PLN 8.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. A detailed description of this transaction is included in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements of Agora Group for the year 2016. The total negative impact of the acquisition of GoldenLine on the net result of the Group amounted to PLN 3.3 million. As a result in 2016, the Group's EBITDA amounted to PLN 114.9 million and was lower yoy. The EBIT operating profit amounted to PLN 16.7 million. The net loss amounted to PLN 13.2 million and the net loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent company amounted to PLN 16.6 million. On 2 December 2016, the METRO television channel, launched by Agora Group company as a part of MUX-8, started broadcasting. On December 9, 2016, Agora announced sale of minority stake to Discovery Polska Sp. z o.o. As a result of the transaction and rules of cooperation following from the investment agreement, the shares in Green Content still owned by the Group are measured in the Group's consolidated financial statements according to the equity method. It means that the result of the Agora Group will include the share in net profit or loss of Green Content. In 2016, negative impact of Green Content's activity on the net result of the Agora Group before the sale of the minority stake amounted to approximately PLN 2.0 million, while the Group's share in the company's net loss in December 2016 amounted to approximately PLN 1.4 million. At the same time, settlement of the sale of shares in Green Content had positive impact on the Group's other operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 in the amount of PLN 10.5 million and in the amount of PLN 9.2 million on the Group's net result. In effect, the company's total impact on the net result of the Agora Group in 2016 was positive and amounted to approximately PLN 5.8 million. As at 31 December 2016, the Group's monetary assets amounted to PLN 124.2 million, which comprised cash and cash equivalents in the amount of PLN 50.2 million (cash on hand, bank accounts and deposits) and PLN 74.0 million invested in short-term securities. Additionally, as at 31 December 2016, the Group held long-term cash receivables of PLN 21.6 million deposited by AMS S.A. as cash collateral securing the bank guarantees granted in relation to performance of the concession contract for the construction and modernisation of bus/tram shelters in Warsaw (PLN 10.8 million of which is disclosed under long-term receivables). As at the end of December 2016, the Group's debt amounted to PLN 110.9 million (including external debt of Helios S.A. consisting of bank loans and finance lease liabilities in the amount of PLN 81.3 million).

(1) particular sales positions, apart from ticket sales and printing services, include sales of the Agora's Publishing House and film activities (co-production and distribution in the Movies and Books segment), described in details in point IV.B in this report.

In 2016, the Group's total revenue amounted to PLN 1,198.4 million (up by 0.8% yoy).
In 2016, the Group's advertising revenue slightly decreased -- by 0.1% yoy -- and amounted to PLN 561.6 million. It grew at the fastest pace in the Internet and Outdoor segments. Advertising revenue in the Movies and Books as well as Radio segments also increased.
In 2016, revenue from tickets sold in Helios cinemas increased by 19.7% yoy and amounted to PLN 194.2 million. In the reporting period, the number of tickets sold in Helios cinemas amounted to more than 10.8 million, which meant a yoy increase by 15.4%. In the same period, the overall number of cinema tickets sold in Poland amounted to 52.1 million and increased by 16.5% yoy [10].
In the period January­December 2016, the Group's copy sales revenue amounted to PLN 135.7 million and decreased by 6.3% yoy. The factor that influenced the level of the Group's copy sales revenue was, among others, the continued downward trend with regard to copy sales of printed press.
In 2016, revenue from the sales of printing services in the Group amounted to PLN 147.7 million and was lower by 5.4% yoy, which was mainly related to lower volume of orders in the heatset technology.
The revenue from other sales amounted to PLN 159.2 million and decreased by 2.7% yoy. The largest category of revenue included under this item is revenue from concession sales in Helios cinemas, which increased by 21.5% yoy to PLN 72.3 million. Revenue from sale of online services in GoldenLine also increased.

In 2016, the Group's net operating costs increased by 0.9% yoy to PLN 1,181.7 million.
In 2016, the costs of external services increased by 5.9% yoy and amounted to PLN 424.1 million. The main factors that caused the increase were higher payments for film copies due to higher attendance in cinemas and higher revenue from ticket sales. The costs of advertising brokerage services, mainly in the Internet segment, rent and lease payments as well as waste disposal and cleaning services related to a larger number of cinema facilities were also higher yoy. In 2016, the level of costs of external services was also affected by the settlement with the producer of the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt related to the sale of the game and its add ons.
In 2016, staff costs increased by 1.9% yoy to PLN 323.2 million. There were increases recorded in most of the Group's operating segments. The highest increases took place in the following segments: Movies and Books, among others in connection with development of the Helios cinema network, Internet, among others as a result of full consolidation of GoldenLine and increase in employment in Yieldbird, Optimizers, in sports services of Gazeta.pl and advertising networks as well as in Outdoor segment in connection with higher execution of sales objectives. At the same time, these costs were reduced in the Press and Print segments.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the operating costs of the Press, Internet and Print segments as well as supporting departments were charged with a total amount of PLN 6.9 million in connection with the group lay-offs process carried out at Agora S.A. As a part of this process, by the end of December 2016, 176 termination notices were handed in, terminating employment contracts or changing terms and conditions of employment.
A decrease by 2.8% yoy in the costs of materials and energy recorded in 2016 resulted mainly from lower cost of production materials related to lower production volumes.
The Group's cost of promotion and marketing decreased in 2016 by 4.5% yoy to PLN 83.5 million. This resulted from less intensified promotional activity in most operating segments. Its increase only took place in the Radio segment in connection with the Radio Zlote Przeboje image campaign.

3. PROSPECTS
In 2016, as a part of strategic review of assets, the Company's Management board decided to sell the real property in Warsaw and Lodz which had not been used by the Company in its operating activity. The Company intends to use the funds from these transactions for development activity. The sale of the real property in Lodz took place in the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive impact on the Group's results in 2017 may be caused by execution of the preliminary sale agreement concerning the right of perpetual usufruct of undeveloped land in Warsaw. The company announced signature of this agreement in regulatory filing No 33/2016 on December 16, 2016.
The total sales price of the real property will amount to PLN 19.0 million net, while positive impact of this transaction of the operating result (EBIT) of the Company and the Agora Group in 2017 can amount to approximately PLN 8.0 million.
At the same time, it should be noted that the net result of the Agora Group in 2017 will also be affected by the activity of the company Green Content, which launched its METRO television channel as a part of MUX-8 on 2 December 2016.

3.1. Revenue

3.1.1. Advertising market [3]

The value of advertising expenditure in 2016 in Poland grew by over 2,5% yoy. The advertisers spent on promotion on their products and services almost PLN 8.4 billion

According to the Company's estimates in 2017 the value of advertising expenditure may grow by 1-3% yoy. The estimated dynamics of changes in advertising expenditure in particular media is presented in the table below:

Television 1-3%

Internet Magazines Radio 5-8% (10%)-(7%) (2%)-2%

Cinema

1-3% (17%)-(14%) 1-4%

3.1.2. Copy sales
In 2017, negative trends relating to copy sales of dailies and magazines in their print versions will continue. The Company is continuously developing the offer of digital content. At the beginning of 2014, Agora implemented, as the first publisher in Poland, a new model of access to the digital content of Gazeta Wyborcza and a digital subscription offer. At the end of December 2016, the number of paid digital subscriptions of the daily amounted to approximately 100 thousand. At the same time, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company conducted restructuring activities in the Press segment, which included both group lay-offs and change in the daily's publishing formula. In the Company's opinion, such activities, together with other factors, should stabilise the Press segment's financial results in the long term.
3.1.3. Ticket sales
The most significant factor affecting attendance in Polish cinemas is the repertoire. Based on the available information, the number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas in 2016 amounted to 52.1 million, which means an increase by more than 16.5% yoy [10].
Simultaneously, it should be noted that the year 2016 brought another record in cinema attendance in Poland. The number of tickets sold in Polish cinemas increased significantly third year in a row. In the Company's opinion, a success in 2017 will be repeating the attendance results from 2016.
3.2 Operating cost
Operating costs of the Agora Group in 2017 should be lower than those recorded in 2016. It will be caused mainly by restructuring activities implemented in the Press segment, lower costs of the Agora's Publishing House as well as discontinuation of issue of Metrocafe.pl.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 10

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements

3.2.1. Costs of external services
The cost of external services in 2017 will largely depend on the cost of sales brokerage in advertising -- in particular in the Internet segment, costs of film copy purchase related directly to the level of revenue from ticket sales and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. In addition, the increase in this cost item will be affected by opening of new cinema facilities in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as those planned for 2017, fees for film producers related to the Group's film distribution business and execution of other development projects.
3.2.2. Staff cost
According to the Company's estimates staff costs will be lower in 2016. It results primarily from group lay-offs, carried out in Agora S.A. in 2016 (mainly in the Press, Internet and Print segments) as well as from resignation from issuance of the Metrocafe.pl daily. The group lay-offs executed in the fourth quarter of 2016 affected mainly the Press segment. However, it should be noted that due the dynamics growth in digital sphere the segment strengthens its competencies in this field by recruitment of specialists. The Company estimates that as a result of all actions undertaken in the segments the cost of staff cost will be lower in that segment by ca. PLN 7.0 million yoy. Reduction of these costs in the Agora Group will be also caused by lower yoy remuneration in the Outdoor and Radio segments as well as in supporting divisions of Agora S.A. compared to 2016. Staff costs will increase in the Movies and Books and Internet segments. In the Movies and Books segment, it will be significantly affected by the amendment to the act on minimum wage, implemented from 2017. It will also affect the level of third party services related to the cleaning servies in Helios cinemas. In the Company's opinion, the total influence of the change in the minimum hourly wage may inrease the operating cost in the segment by ca. PLN 8.0 ­ 10.0 million yoy, which will also affect the operating result of the Movies and Books segment in 2017. On the other hand, in the Internet segment, the costs of fixed remuneration will increase mainly as a result of the process of replacing some civil law agreements with contracts of employment as well as implementation of new development projects.
3.2.3. Promotion and marketing cost
In 2017, the Agora Group is planning to implement more development activities, with which promotional activities are related. The dynamics of changes in individual media, the number of launched development projects, as well as market activities of the Group's competitors may affect the level of these expenses. Considering the above factors, the Company estimates that in 2017 this cost item may increase, in particular in the Internet segment. It is connected with development activities implemented in this area and the planned advertising campaign of the Gazeta.pl service. The Company estimates, however, that expenditure on promotion and marketing in the Press and Movies and Books segments will be lower yoy.
3.2.4. Cost of raw materials and energy
According to the Company's estimates, in 2017 this cost item will be shaped by similar market trends to those in 2016. The Group's Print segment has the largest impact on this cost item, especially the cost of production materials, the volume of production and the EUR/PLN exchange rate. The Company estimates that due to reduction in volume of printed titles, the value of this cost item will be lower in 2017.
4. THE GROWTH DIRECTIONS OF THE AGORA GROUP
The primary objective of Agora is the growth in media sector. Agora Group wants to achieve the objective by the growth of revenues and profitability improvement according to the medium term development plans announced in March 2014. The key to success is execution of four main tasks: 1) digital transformation of print media operations, 2) building position in the TV market,
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 11

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
3) profitability improvement of the Group's key business segments, 4) cost optimization of the Group's shared functions and infrastructure. Due to the implementation of the metered paywall on Gazeta Wyborcza's website in February, 2014 the process of digital transformation significantly accelerated in the Agora Group. In order to achieve that goal, the Group supports development of quality journalism and builds necessary technological tools. At the end of 2016, the number of paid digital subscriptions of Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to almost 100.0 thousand. In the near future, the Company plans to focus primarily on increasing the average revenue from the subscription, and on increasing the scale of the advertising revenue from websites associated with the daily, than on the growth of the subscriptions base. At the same time, the Company conducted restructuring activities in areas related to the release of the daily. They concerned both: reducing operational costs which included group lay-offs, as well as activities set to reduce the decline in revenue. The company has introduced twice daily's price increase. Its activities also covered the change in the daily's publishing formula and the introduction of new proposals for the readers. On March 15, 2014 the Agora Group entered the TV market launching Stopklatka TV - a TV channel created together with Kino Polska TV S.A. Agora's objective was a quick success of the digital film channel and its aspires to build a significant position in the TV thematic channel market in the long term perspective. According to our plan in 2016 Stopklatka achieved profitability. In 2015, Agora won the concession proceedings and on the 2nd of December, 2016 the Company launched TV station METRO on MUX-8, terrestrial platform in signal of eighth multiplex. On the 9th of December, 2016 concluded an investment agreement, gaining Discovery Polska Sp. z o.o. as a partner to run the channel. Agora systematically develops its other business segments. The Group aims to grow its cinema network Helios and increase the scale of operations in the field of film distribution and co-production. In 2016 Helios network grew by four new cinemas and at the end of the year had already 41 modern cinemas. What is worth to notice thanks to systematic implemented strategy of development and the growth in attendance in Poland, Helios S.A. achieved the best financial results in its history. In the outdoor business Agora wants to strengthen its position in the premium segment ­ at the end of 2016 1,333 out of 1,580 bus shelters with citylight panels were visible in the streets of Warsaw - which resulted in the highest in the history of AMS SA operating result. The priority for the Group's online operations is an intensive growth in mobile and video as well as further diversification of revenue streams, among others thanks Yieldbird. The Group's objective in the radio business is to grow technical reach of current radio stations. In 2016 the radio stations of Agora achieved the highest daily reach in its history. The Agora Group undertook optimization initiatives related to the Group's cost of shared functions and infrastructure in order to simplify and unify internal processes.

2.3. Sales and markets
Over 90% of the total sales of the Group were related to sales in domestic market. Sales to foreign markets are realized mainly through the sales of printing and advertising services to foreign customers and sales of publications (including foreign subscription).

The Group does not depend on one particular customer. The biggest customers of the Group (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). In 2016, the value of transactions with none of the distributors exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.4. Suppliers
The Group does not depend on one particular supplier. Newsprint and printing services are important cost items of the Group. Newsprint used for printing services for external customers and in order to print the Group's own titles is purchased from several suppliers. In 2016, the value of transactions with none of the suppliers exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.5. Finance cost, net
Net financial activities of the Group for 2016 were influenced mainly by the revaluation of the liabilities resulting from put options granted to the non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries and the effect of the remeasurement of previously held equity interest in the subsidiary GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. at the acquisition date in the first quarter of 2016. Moreover, net financial activities of the Group were affected by income from short-term investments and cost of commissions and interest on bank loans and lease liabilities.

3.1. Non-current assets
The decrease in non-current assets, versus 31 December 2015, resulted mainly from depreciation and amortisation charges, which were, to some extent, compensated by new investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
The change in non-current assets versus 31 December 2015 was also affected by the acquisition of assets of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. in the first quarter of 2016 as well as reclassification of some property, plant and equipment to current assets due to their presentation as non-current assets held for sale.
3.2. Current assets
The decrease in current assets, versus 31 December 2015 results mainly from a decrease in accounts receivable and short-term securities, which was, to some extent, compensated by higher balance of cash and cash equivalents.
3.3. Non-current liabilities and provisions
The increase in non-current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2015, stems mainly from higher longterm loans as well as higher put option liabilities due to their remeasurement. The above changes were, to some extent, compensated by a derecognition of long-term liabilities related to license payments as a result of disposal of shares in Green Content Sp. z o.o.
3.4. Current liabilities and provisions
The increase in current liabilities and provisions, versus 31 December 2015, stems from higher income tax liabilities, provisions (due to group lay-offs) and other financial liabilities (due to recognition of cash pooling liabilities to Green Content Sp z o.o.). Those changes were mostly compensated by a decrease in accounts payable and short-term borrowings.

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only In 2016, Agora S.A. has not been engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative purposes). On the basis of the Annex no. 2 to the multi - purpose credit line agreement signed on 24 May 2016 with Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A., Agora S.A. was provided with a time credit of up to PLN 100.0 million, which may be used by 31 May 2017 and with a credit facility in the current account of up to PLN 35.0 million, which may be used by 31 May 2017. As at 31 December 2016, the amount of the time credit is diminished by the non-renewable tranche used in May 2016 in the amount of PLN 25.0 million, which will be paid up in 13 equal installments from June 30, 2017 till June 30, 2020. As at the date of this MD&A report, considering the cash position, the cash pooling system functioning in the Group and available credit facility, the Agora Group does not anticipate any liquidity problems with regards to its further investment plans (including capital investments).
4.1. Operating activities
The decrease in net inflows from operating activities, in 2016, stems mainly from the lower result from the main operating activities of the Group and higher payments of income tax liabilities.
4.2. Investment activities
Net outflows from investing activities, in 2016, results mainly from expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangibles as well as acquisition of GoldenLine sp. z o.o. Those outflows were to some extent compensated by net proceeds from disposal of short-term securities and property, plant and equipment as well as other inflows related to the return of cash paid by the Company in connection with the subscriptions for shares of Stopklatka S.A. and the return of cash deposits provided to the bank by AMS S.A. as a cash collateral securing the concession contract for construction and utilization of bus shelters in Warsaw.
4.3. Financing activities
Net outflows from financing activities, in 2016, results mainly from the payment of dividend to equity holders of the parent (PLN 35.7 million), financial lease payments as well as acquisition of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Those outflows were to some extent compensated by net cash inflows from bank loans (including the one related to the tranche of the time credit used by Agora S.A. in the amount of PLN 25.0 million in the second quarter of 2016).

1. REVENUE
In 2016, total revenue of the Press segment decreased by 10.9% yoy and amounted to PLN 267.9 million. The value of the segment's revenue was affected the most by lower revenue from advertising sales (down by 16.3% yoy), both for Gazeta Wyborcza and Metrocafe.pl. Lower revenue of Metrocafe.pl was related to the discontinuation of its issue in mid October 2016. Revenue from the advertising sales in magazines was, however, higher than in 2015, which was related with systematically implemented strategy for monetisation of their online position. During this period, the segment's revenue from copy sales was also lower and amounted to PLN 122.8 million.
1.1. Copy sales 1.1.1. Copy sales and readership of Gazeta Wyborcza [4]
In 2016, Gazeta Wyborcza maintained its leading position among the opinion-forming dailies. The average payable distribution of Gazeta Wyborcza amounted to 159 thousand copies and decreased by 10.5% yoy. At the same time, it should be noted that the daily is systematically increasing the number of payable active digital subscriptions. At the end of December 2016, their number amounted to approximately 100 thousand. In the analysed period, the revenue from copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza decreased by 6.2% yoy. In the reporting period, the weekly readership of Gazeta Wyborcza stood at 6.9% (2.1 million readers; CCS, weekly readership index), which placed it as the second daily among nationwide dailies.
1.1.2. Copy sales of Agora's magazines
In 2016, revenue from copy sales of Magazines decreased by 11.7% yoy. The average number of monthly magazine copies sold by Agora amounted to 303.7 thousand copies (down by 1.5% yoy).
1.2. Advertising sales [3] 1.2.1. Advertising sales of Gazeta Wyborcza
In 2016, Gazeta Wyborcza's net advertising revenue from all the advertising activity (including display advertising, classifieds and inserts) amounted to PLN 82.4 million (down by 21.6% yoy). It should be noted that since 2016, total revenue from the dual-media offer are included in the revenue from advertising sales of Gazeta Wyborcza. In 2015, the above figures included only a portion of revenue from dualmedia advertising offers (published both in the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza and on the GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl vertical portals and the Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website), which is allocated to the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza. In 2016, ad spending in Polish dailies decreased by almost 19.5% yoy. In the analysed period, Gazeta Wyborcza's spending on display advertising decreased by ca 23.0% yoy, and its estimated share in display ad spending in dailies decreased by ca. 1.5 pp yoy, amounting to ca. 35.5%. In 2016, Gazeta Wyborcza's share in the national newspapers ad spend amounted to almost 45.5% and decreased by 0.5 pp yoy. In this period, Gazeta Wyborcza maintained its share in ad spending in Warsaw based dailies. At the same time, Gazeta Wyborcza's share in ad spending in local dailies (excluding Warsaw) decreased by ca. 2.5 pp yoy. One should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to a significant discounting pressure on the part of advertisers. Once the Company has more reliable market data, it may adjust the ad spend estimations in the consecutive reporting periods.
1.2.2. Advertising sales of Metrocafe.pl [3],[4]
In 2016 as a result of shut-down of this title in mid October, advertising revenue of Metrocafe.pl decreased by 40.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 11.8 million.

1.2.3. Advertising sales of Agora's magazines
In 2016, the advertising sales of Agora's magazines increased by 12.8% yoy to PLN 24.6 million. Its increase is, among others, a result of income on advertising sales in Pogoda na ycie monthly (title issued only in 2016), a result of dynamic development of online services as well as of the custom publishing offer, reported since 2016 under advertising revenue of Magazines.
At the same time, advertisers limited their expenditure in magazines by almost 8.0%. Agora had a 3.7% share in the total national magazines ad spend (based on rate card data) [7] and a 7.2% share in monthlies ad spend (based on rate card data) [7].
2. COST
In 2016, the segment's operating costs declined by 4.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 270.7 million. This resulted mainly from lower costs of materials, energy, goods and printing services due to lower printing volumes of own magazines, among others due to discontinuation of issue of the free Metrocafe.pl in mid October 2016.
Moreover, promotion and marketing costs in the Press segment were lower yoy, and they amounted to PLN 45.1 million. A decrease was also recorded in staff costs due to lower bonus payments in connection with lower yearon-year execution of sales budgets and lower headcount in the segment. At the same time, in the fourth quarter of 2016, a group lay-off process was being implemented in the segment. The provision for this purpose amounted to PLN 5.8 million and was charged to the segment result in the fourth quarter of 2016.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2016, the Press segment was focused on development of its product portfolio -- both paper-based and digital.
During that time, prices of individual issues of Gazeta Wyborcza was changed twice and were accompanied by changes in the daily. Since February 2016, the Thursday, Friday and Saturday paper editions of Gazeta Wyborcza had been available at new prices: PLN 3.40 on Thursdays and Fridays and PLN 3.50 on Saturdays. The subscription offer for the digital version of the daily has also been modified, providing readers with two packages to choose from: Wyborcza and Wyborcza Premium, both available at new prices. Since 4th of June 2016, Gazeta Wyborcza has been available with modified layout, changed content arrangement and a modified logo. Information is more distinctly separated from commentaries, the latter now being printed on a grey background. The order of sections has also been altered. For instance, economy-related topics appear closer to the title page. The refreshed logo of Gazeta Wyborcza features a modern font and the word "Wyborcza" is more visible, referencing the logos of the digital brand -- Wyborcza.pl or Wyborcza.biz. The logos of 19 local editions of the daily have also been changed.
Since 17 October 2016, Gazeta Wyborcza has been released in a new publishing formula and with a new layout of weeklies issued together with this title on individual days of the week. At the same time, the Monday issue of the daily has been supplemented with a completely new magazine, Moj biznes. Ludzie, praca, innowacje.
The changes in the publishing offer of the daily were also accompanied by change of the prices of the individual issues. On Mondays and Fridays, a copy of Gazeta Wyborcza costs PLN 3.99, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays -- PLN 2.99, while the weekend edition -- PLN 4.49 in Warsaw and PLN 4.29 in other towns.
These changes were also accompanied by a premiere of a new version of the Wyborcza.pl service, which improved the transparency of content layout and facilitated reading of longer texts through inclusion on audiovisual materials, graphics and social media comments. Moreover, the new service ensures quicker loading of the page and its contents. Special exposure on the new page was given to video materials prepared by the Wyborcza.pl team, which are emitted according to the morning, afternoon and evening cycles. During that time, the Wideo.Wyborcza.pl team was considerably expanded and strengthened in terms of personnel with competences within the scope of digital messaging.
Starting with its February issue, the Dziecko monthly has been coming out in a new format, with a refreshed layout, changed order of sections and at a lower price. The magazine provides practical advice and tips for parents on the upbringing and care of infants and young children.

translation only The January 21st, 2016 marked the début of the new shopping platform Avanti24 established as a combination of Avanti24 and Groszki.pl. The website offers lifestyle-oriented advice addressed mainly to women of all ages who are interested in fashion, beauty and the latest trends. It also functions as an aggregator of online stores with a convenient product search engine. In February 2016, an innovative project developed by Gazeta Wyborcza and BIQdata.pl was awarded funding as part of Google's Digital News Initiative in the Large Projects category. The project's aim is to help Poles understand the impact of large and small-scale politics on their everyday lives, including their household budgets, education and healthcare. A total of 7 Polish projects received funding, including two submitted by Agora -- one by Gazeta Wyborcza and one by Grupa Radiowa Agory. Wysokie Obcasy, a weekly published with Gazeta Wyborcza on Saturdays, as a part of the second round of the Digital News Initiative programme, was subsidised by Google for implementation of the project under the working title Women Choose The News. The result of the project will be a platform created exclusively by women. Journalists from all EU Member States will cooperate with the platform. Their proposals of crucial daily information will reach th audience through a website, a newsletter and social media. The most important women in public life -- operating in politics, artists or activists -- will also appear in the service. The portal will be created in English by the editorial team of Wysokie Obcasy. In July this year, the editorial team of Ladnydom.pl offered new functionalities to its users, including the possibility to purchase products which are of interest to them and a product search engine. Thanks to the above, not only can they read about attractive products but also buy them. In July 2016, a special edition of the monthly Avanti ­ Fit&Beauty was published. It was dedicated to fitness, healthy lifestyle and diets.

(3) the amounts do not include costs related to Publishing House division;
(4) the amounts include D&A cost in Publishing House division, which in 2016 amounted to PLN 0.7 million and in 2015 amounted to PLN 7.7 million.

1. REVENUE [3]
In 2016, the revenue of the Movies and Books segment increased by 5.5% yoy to PLN 364.0 million.
During this time, the number of visitors to Helios cinemas amounted to over 10.8 million and increased by 15.4% yoy. This, combined with higher average ticket price and higher concession sales, translated into a considerably higher revenue from ticket sales and concession sales, which amounted to PLN 195.1 million and PLN 72.3 million, respectively.
In 2016, the Movies and Books segment's total revenue from film co-production and distribution amounted to PLN 8.5 million, showing a 52.2% decrease yoy. In 2016, NEXT FILM released 6 Polish productions and 2 foreign titles for cinema distribution.

In 2016, the Special Projects division recorded revenue from film co-production of the films introduced to Polish cinemas in earlier periods, mainly Karbala in connection with the distribution in cinemas, on DVD and VOD.
In 2016, the revenue of Agora's Publishing House (operating within the Special Projects division) amounted to PLN 45.6 million and decreased by 29.1% year on year. In 2015, the level of Agora's Publishing House's revenue was considerably positively affected by the revenue from the rights to sell the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
In 2016, Agora's Publishing House issued 60 premiere books, 19 musical publications and 7 film publications. As a result, during the analysed period, the Publishing House sold approximately 0.9 million books and books with CDs/DVDs.
2. COST
In 2016, the operating costs of the Movies and Books segment increased by 4.8% yoy and amounted to PLN 337.0 million.
The increase in the segment's operating costs in 2016 resulted, among other things, from the higher cost of external services. An important factor that caused the increase in this cost item were higher payments for film copies due to higher attendance in Helios cinemas, which simultaneously translated into the increase in revenue from ticket sales. Moreover, the increase in the cost of external services is connected with higher rent costs at the cinemas of the Helios network associated with its expansion. Due to the expansion of the Helios cinema network and higher concession sales, an increase was recorded in staff costs, the costs of materials and energy and in the value of goods and materials sold. The decrease in promotion and marketing costs is related to less intensified promotional activity in film distribution. However, operating costs of the Publishing House, which amounted to PLN 45.7 million, were lower year on year. In 2015, the level of costs of the Publishing House was significantly affected by the costs related to the rights to sell the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In 2016, NEXT FILM, a Helios subsidiary company specialising in film distribution, introduced 8 new film productions entitled: Excentrycy, czyli po slonecznej stronie ulicy; Opowiesc o milosci i mroku; Wszystko gra; Tajemnice Manhattanu; Slugi Boze; Jestem Morderca, Szkola uwodzenia Czeslawa M. and Plac Zabaw to Polish cinemas.
Agora also acted as the co-producer of four movies: Excentrcy, czyli poslonecznej stronie ulicy; Slugi boze; Jestem Morderca and Szkola uwodzenia Czeslawa M.
In the first quarter of 2016, productions that were shown in cinemas in 2015 were released on DVD: Krol zycia and Karbala in January 2016, and Obce niebo in February 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, in May, Agora released Excentrycy, czyli po slonecznej stronie ulicy on DVD.
On 8 April 2016, Krol swingu, a musical inspired by Janusz Majewski's film Excentrycy, czyli po slonecznej stronie ulicy, had its début in Wroclaw. Cast in the leading roles were Maciej Stuhr, Sonia Bohosiewicz and Natalia Rybicka who all starred in the movie, joined by singer Kuba Badach. Szczecin, Poznan Plock, Gdansk and Bydgoszcz also hosted these concerts with swing hits of the 1950's. The event was organised by: Agora and Festival Group.
In mid-March 2016, Helios and the Blue City shopping and entertainment centre announced the opening of the network's new cinema in Warsaw. In the first half of 2016, Helios also signed agreements to open 6 new cinema facilities in the following cities: Przemysl, Tomaszow Mazowiecki, Wolomin, Stalowa Wola, Krosno and Gdansk.
In October 2016, the Helios network opened four facilities: in Poznan, Przemysl, Gdansk and Tomaszow Mazowiecki. Helios remains the largest cinema network in Poland with respect to the number of facilities -- at the end of 2016 it had 41 cinemas with 229 screens and ca. 47 thousand seats. Also in October 2016, the Helios network announced signature of an agreement on opening two more multiplexes. In 2018, the network will open a cinema in the Forum Gdansk complex in Gdansk, while in 2021, it will launch a modern facility in Galeria Piaseczno in Piaseczno near Warsaw. In February 2017 the network opened a new cinema in Wolomin and still plans to open new Helios facilities.

Thanks to a significant increase in revenue, the Outdoor segment improved its operating results in 2016. Throughout 2016, the segment's operating result at the EBIT level increased by 45.6% yoy and amounted to PLN 24.9 million. The segment's EBITDA increased to PLN 40.8 million and the EBITDA margin increased by 4.9 pp yoy to 24.3%. It is the best result in the history of the Outdoor segment.
1. REVENUE [8]
According to the IGRZ (Outdoor Advertising Chamber) report, in 2016, expenditure in the outdoor advertising market was higher by 4.5% yoy. In 2016 the growth dynamics of AMS' advertising revenues was higher that the growth of the outdoor market expenditure reported by IGRZ and amounted to 8.0% yoy. A more dynamic revenue growth for the entire 2016 than that recorded by the market was mainly achieved based on advertisers' spending on citylight and backlight panels, 18 m billboards and municipal transport vehicles. In 2016, the estimated share of the AMS Group in the outdoor ad spend amounted to almost 36.5% [8].
2. COST
In 2016, the segment's operating costs increased by 2.9% yoy and amounted to PLN 143.1 million, mainly due to higher costs of campaign execution, staff costs and amortisation.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 26

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
In 2016, the costs of executed campaigns grew by 6.4% yoy as a result of higher costs of poster printing, higher costs of lease of advertising space on buses and higher costs of implementation of non-standard projects on advertising panels. Their increase resulted from execution of more: poster printing services, advertising campaigns on buses and non-standard campaigns. The reduction of the costs of system maintenance by 5.4% yoy in 2016 results mainly from the change of the structure of AMS operating costs. As a result of implementation of the concession contracts for the construction and use of bus/tram shelters, amortisation costs increased and the costs of rent were reduced. Another element contributing to reduction of these costs was a decrease in the number of owned advertising panels, mainly in the BB12 segment.
Staff costs increased by 11.9% yoy in 2016 as a consequence of an increase in the variable components of remuneration as a result of better performance in terms of assumed sales targets. In 2016, the segment's marketing and promotion expenses decreased by 17.3% yoy. This was due to a social communication campaign of a total value lower than the campaigns executed in 2015. An increase in D&A costs compared to 2015 has also contributed to the increase in the segment's operating costs. This increase results from intensive investment activity in connection with the performance of the concession contracts for the construction and use of bus shelters in Warsaw and Cracow. As at the end of December 2016, there were already 1,333 new bus shelters on the streets of Warsaw and 162 in Cracow. Due to a large number of agreed substitute locations and prolonged time of issuing so-called administrative permits for bus/tram shelters in Warsaw the deadline of construction the last part of bus shelters was changed. On the basis of agreement with city of Warsaw the last portion of 247 bus shelters will be construted till the end of September 2017.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In the first quarter of 2016, the Outdoor segment, in collaboration with an advertising agency and a commercial partner, prepared a unique promotional campaign using the interactive functions of a citylight panel in bus shelters in Wroclaw. In May 2016, the interior of an advertising column was used for the first time in a promotional campaign in Poland. As part of the first project, in a campaign for a retail chain, the AMS team used advertising columns filled with flowers, whilst another project involved placing cones made of compact discs inside the columns, as well as models of animals referencing the artwork of the music album being promoted. Both campaigns took place in Warsaw. In the last quarter of 2016, AMS won another tender in Wroclaw for two-year lease of 74 citylights in the strict city centre. At the same time, the company finalised the construction of 51 bus shelters in Sosnowiec. AMS introduced new non-standard solutions into its offer: heated benches at bus/tram shelters and special poster print, thanks to which images gain the effect of depth (3D optical impression). The company also proposed a completely new solutions to its customers available from January 2017 -- Dynamic Backlight, which allows for a more dynamic advertising message using a static vinyl poster (optical effect of movement on a static panel).

(2) in 2015 presented amounts include, among others, allocated revenues from the dual media offer (i.e. published both in Gazeta Wyborcza, as well as on GazetaPraca.pl, Domiporta.pl, Komunikaty.pl verticals and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website). Since 2016 the revenues from dual media offers, as well as revenues from listings in verticals Komunikaty.pl and NekrologiWyborcza.pl are not allocated to Internet division.

In the entire 2016, EBIT operating result of the Internet segment amounted to PLN 23.0 million and decreased by 5.0% yoy [1]. It should be noted that the comparability of the segment's results against the corresponding periods in 2015 is impacted by the change in the settlement method for dual-media announcements as well as announcements at Komunikaty.pl and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl and the acquisition of majority ownership of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. as of January 2016. Due to taking control of the company in January 2016, its results are consolidated under the full method, while in 2015 they were recognised in the results of the Agora Group under the equity method. Moreover, comparability of the results in the whole 2016 to analogical period of 2015, was affected by damages paid in 2015 to Agora S.A. by Business Insider Inc. in connection with termination of the agreement under which Agora S.A. was to run a business-technology portal, which also contributed to an improved operating result of the segment in 2015.
1. REVENUE
In 2016, the revenue increased by 11.6% yoy, reaching PLN 167.9 million. This substantial increase in revenue was affected, among other things, by higher sales of web display advertising and the sales of other internet services, such as access to the candidate search engine and employers' profiles through the GoldenLine.pl website.
In 2016, the inflows from web display advertising sales increased by 9.2% yoy,reached the record level of PLN 135.2 million. The increase in the segment's advertising revenue was significantly influenced by higher sales of web

translation only
display advertising by the Yieldbird network (formerly AdTaily) and affiliated networks as well as revenue generated by the GoldenLine.pl website.
In the entire 2016 advertising sales in verticals went down by 3.7% yoy to PLN 13.0 million. The growth dynamics of the revenue was negatively affected by the change in the method of settling inflows from dual-media announcements as well as announcements on Komunikaty.pl and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl with the Press segment. However, there was a significant increase in the sales of announcements in recruitment (such as Goldenline.pl) and real estates (Domiporta.pl) verticals.
2. COST
In 2016, they were by 14.7% yoy higher and amounted to PLN 144.9 million. The increase in operating costs was significantly affected by higher costs of external services, staff costs and costs relating to the group lay-offs.
The costs of external services increased by 33.1% yoy to PLN 64.0 million in the entire 2016. The increase in the costs of external services was caused mainly by higher rental costs of advertising space Yieldbird, affiliated networks and GoldenLine. The increase in this cost item was accompanied by growing revenue from advertising brokerage services which contributed to the growth of the segment's total revenue. Apart from the higher rental costs of advertising space, the segment also recorded an increase in the costs of other external services in GoldenLine (consolidated under the full method as of January 2016) and in Yieldbird.
The staff costs increased by 7.8% yoy to PLN 52.4 million in 2016. It is mainly the result of full consolidation of GoldenLine and an increased headcount in Yieldbird, Optimizers, sports websites of Gazeta.pl and affiliated marketing.
Expenditure on promotion and marketing in the Internet segment decreased in 2016. This decrease is connected primarily with the reduction in advertising expenditure settled in barter on promotion of Gazeta.pl websites and Kinoplex.pl website, which was sold in 2016.
3. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON INTERNET ACTIVITIES
In December 2016, the reach of Gazeta.pl group websites among Polish Internet users stood at 59.3%, and the number of users reached 16.3 million. The total number of page views of Gazeta.pl group websites reached 733.5 million, with an average viewing time of 58 minutes per user [6].
In December 2016, 10.5 million Internet users (reach of 38.2%) viewed the websites of Gazeta.pl group on mobile devices, which made Gazeta.pl group the sixth player according to the market survey of Gemius PBI. The number of mobile page views amounted to 362.3 million, and the share of mobile page views on the websites of Gazeta.pl group stood at 49.4% and was the highest among Polish horizontal portals [6].
The websites of Gazeta.pl group are ranked among the top thematic market players. In accordance with the data of Gemius PBI for December 2016, the websites of Gazeta.pl group are the leader in the Work category (Gazetapraca.pl, Goldenline.pl), hold the third place in the Information and Journalism and Sports (among others, Sport.pl), Children and Family (eDziecko.pl), Rumours, celebrity life (Plotek.pl) categories, and the fourth place in the thematic ranking of and Cuisine and Cooking (Ugotuj.to, Haps.gazeta.pl).
4. NEW INITIATIVES
In January 2016, Agora acquired a majority stake in GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. for PLN 8,48 million. With this transaction, the Company will strengthen its position in the recruitment services market, by creating the only range of services available to Polish employers and candidates to be this comprehensive.
In March 2016, Agora's Internet segment was joined by Optimizers Sp. z o.o. This is the new name of an online advertising agency specialising in performance marketing that belongs to the Agora Group and has been transformed into a separate company. Optimizers provides advertising services in the area of performance marketing to businesses of various sizes, representing various industries. The agency began operations in March 2009, focusing on SEM/SEO activities. Since then it has extended its service range to include new advertising products.

1. REVENUE [3]
In 2016, the revenue of the Radio segment increased by 5.3% yoy and amounted to PLN 113.4 million. The increase in revenue of the segment resulted mainly from higher revenue from provided brokerage services for Helios cinemas and higher air time sales in the radio stations of Agora Radio Group. However, in the discussed period, inflows from brokerage of sale of air time in stations of other broadcasters were lower. In 2016, the total radio advertising expenditure in Poland increased by 1.5% yoy.
2. COST
In 2016, the operating costs of the segment increased by 6.7% yoy to PLN 100.6 million. This increase was mainly due to higher costs of promotion and marketing relating primarily to the expenditure incurred on Radio Zlote Przeboje image campaign.
In the discussed period, the costs related with sales brokerage services for Helios cinemas, reported under external services, were also higher yoy. Apart from the advertising brokerage costs and the costs related to the sales of advertising services in Helios cinemas, the external services item also includes rental fees, production services as well as operator fees.
A yoy increase in staff costs mainly resulted from higher headcount in connection with strengthening of the sales department.

Since March 2016, Radio Pogoda has been available to audiences in Bydgoszcz, Wroclaw and the Silesian Metropolis, with music and interesting programmes for mature listeners. The youngest brand in Agora Radio Group's portfolio is now present in 7 Polish cities. It was possible to launch new radio stations under the Radio Pogoda brand due to changing the names of 3 of the Group's stations broadcasting previously as Rock Radio. Rock Radio can still be found on the airwaves in 4 Polish cities: Warsaw, Poznan, Opole and Cracow.
In mid-March 2016, Agora Radio Group's Radio TOK FM started broadcasting in Sieradz and the surrounding area (the transmitter is located in Zdunska Wola) on 105.4 FM. On July 22, 2016, new transmitters started operating in Bydgoszcz and Rzeszow, making the station available in a total of 22 cities.
In turn, in mid-June 2016, Radio Zlote Przeboje started broadcasting from Skomielna Czarna in the Malopolskie province on 94.00 MHz.
The Agora Radio Group (GRA) team is also working on developing its digital offering. GRA's novel project Mikrofon TOK FM, as part of which an online platform and an app are to be created, enabling listeners to submit their comments in audio format and effectively co-create the content aired by Radio TOK FM, has been awarded funding as part of Google's Digital News Initiative in the category of prototype projects.

NOTES
[1] The performance measure "EBIT" represents net operating profit/(loss) defined as net profit/(loss) in accordance with IFRS before finance income and costs, share of results of equity accounted investees and income taxes.
The performance measure "EBITDA" is defined as EBIT increased by depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
In the Management Board opinion, EBITDA constitutes a useful supplementary financial indicator in assessing the performance of the Group and its operating segments. It should be taken into account, that EBIT and EBITDA are not measures determined by IFRS and have not a uniform standard of calculation. Accordingly, their calculation and presentation by the Group may differ from that applied by other companies.
EBIT and EBITDA of Press, Internet, Movies and Books as well as Print segments are calculated on the basis of cost directly attributable to the appropriate operating segment of the Agora Group and excludes allocations of all Company's overheads (such as: cost of Agora's Management Board and a majority of cost of the Company`s supporting divisions), which are included in reconciling positions.
Moreover, EBIT of particular operating segments does not include depreciation and amortisation recognised on consolidation as described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
[2] the data on ticket sales in the cinemas comprising Helios group come from the accounting data of Helios reported in accordance with full calendar periods.
[3] The data refer to advertising expenditures in six media (press, radio, TV, outdoor, Internet, cinema). In this MD&A Agora has corrected the numbers for dailies, cinemas and in TV in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the data referring to the expenditure in outdoor advertising market in the first, second and third quarter of 2016, the data referring to the expenditure in Internet advertising market in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first, second and third quarter of 2016 as well as data referring to advertising expenditure in magazines in the first, second and third quarter of 2016.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, press and radio advertising market data referred to herein are based on Agora's estimates adjusted for average discount rate and are stated in current prices. Given the discount pressure as well as advertising time and space sell-offs, these figures may not be fully reliable and will be adjusted in the consecutive reporting periods. In case of press, the data include only display advertising, excluding classifieds, inserts and obituaries. The estimates are based on rate card data obtained from the following sources: Kantar Media monitoring, Agora S.A. monitoring.
Presented TV, Internet and cinema figures are based on initial Starlink media house estimates; TV estimates include regular ad broadcast and sponsoring with product placement, exclude teleshopping and other advertising forms.
Internet ad spend estimates include display, search engines (Search Engine Marketing), e-mail marketing and video advertising.
Outdoor advertising figures are based on Izba Gospodarcza Reklamy Zewnetrznej estimates [8].
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on the average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media.
[4] The data on the number of copies sold (total paid circulation) of daily newspapers is derived from the National Circulation Audit Office (ZKDP). The term "copy sales" used in this MD&A is consistent with the sales declarations of publishers to the National Circulation Audit Office.
The data on dailies readership are based on PBC General, research carried out by MillwardBrown on a random, nationwide sample of Poles over 15 years of age. The CCS index was used (weekly readership index) - percentage of respondents reading at least one edition of the title within 7 days of the week preceding research. Size of the sample: nationwide PBC General for January ­ December 2016: N=20,068.

11. INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Information about financial statements in respect of: risk: price risk, credit risk, material disruptions to cash flow and risk of liquidity problems, on which the Group is exposed and objectives and methods of financial risk management
is disclosed in notes 34 and 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. INFORMATION ON CAPABILITY OF EXECUTION OF INVESTMENT PLANS
As at the date of this MD&A report, considering the cash position, the cash pooling system functioning in the Group and available credit facility, the Agora Group does not anticipate any liquidity problems with regards to its further investment plans (including capital investments).
13. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2016, advertisers spent 2.5% yoy more on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in almost all advertising market segments. The erosion of advertising expenditure was observed only in press. It should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market. Polish economy is sensitive to coutries political situation and looping risk of abrupt legislative changes, whose full impact on the conditions of running business activity in Poland is hard to foresee.
Seasonality of advertising spending The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's advertising revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year. Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarters.
Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting almost half of the advertising market expenditure (48.5%) in 2016. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 28.0% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted 6.0% and 2.5% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2016, 6.0% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted 7.5% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2017 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 51

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.
Abrupt changes to law regulations in particular business areas may affect not only macroeconomic situation in Poland but also the propensity and the way advertisers (including state owned companies) spend advertising budgets.
Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content and on February 4, 2014 the Company introduced system of metered paywall on websites related to Gazeta Wyborcza. At the end of 2016, the number of Gazeta Wyborcza active paid subscriptions totalled almost 100 thousand. Nowadays the Company focuses on the growth of average revenue from each subscription and growth of online advertising revenues. It is hard to predict if the Company will be able to deliver above expectations, because of the competitive internet market.
Due to the global changes in the press market, especially those relating to the shrinking incomes from ad sales, the Company decided to discontinue of issue of the free Metrocafe.pl in mid October 2016, what shall affect the Agora's results in 2017.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive and number of internet users in Poland is not growing so fast as in the past. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. The development of this medium is also determinated by the available structure. In Poland the broadband infrastructure development and its utilization is relatively low in comparison to most EU countries. A different internet access technologies are changing, what significantly affect the market development. The number of mobile internet users is increasing. Both, changes in the internet usage and increase of internet speed may also affect growth dynamics of individual segments of the internet advertising market. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged. Additionally, online advertising market is undergoing transformation. Search advertising is becoming more popular among advertisers. The Group's main source of Internet advertising revenue is display advertising. Programmatic, video and mobile advertising are also growing their share. Maintenance of the strong position in rapidly changing market requires investment in advanced technological solutions. Due to that fact there is no guarantee that the Group will be able to compete with national and foreign players with larger financial resources.
Responsibility for published content
The Group's activity is based in its many aspects on publishing the content created by journalists, writers, publicists or users of Internet forums. This can result in publisher's responsibility or co-responsibility for distribution of information contradictory to law regulations, including infringement of personal interests. It cannot be ruled out, that the Group could unintentionally violate such lawsand as a result it could be a subject of claims relating to that and as a result it may have to pay relevant compensations.

Outdoor
Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
On September 11, 2015 selected regulations on strengthening landscape protection changed. On its basis the local governments acquired rights to regulate the distribution of visual advertisement and small architecture in public space and charging adequate fees. It is really hard to estimate the impact of this regulation on the Agora Group's results. Till the day of this publication 3 local government introduced new rules of charging fees.
In 2014, execution of the contract to construct of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw commenced. The investment process shall last till the end of September, 2017. The estimated cost of the bus shelters' construction amounts to ca PLN 80 million. The duration of the contract is nearly 9 years.
Cinema
Helios opens new cinemas in shopping and entertainment centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping and entertainment galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators.
Additionally, the available repertoire affects results of cinema business. Lack of interesting movies, abilities to promote movies or the quality of movies may negatively affect cinema admissions. Moreover, economic downturn may translate into lower expenditure on entertainment which may result in lower revenues from ticket sales and willingness to buy food and beverages in cinema bars.
Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, in Internet.
Risks of running licensed business
The Group has been running its activities in radio market for years and since 2014 it started to operate in TV market. Radio and TV operations are licensed activity in Poland. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted.
There is a risk that demand, from radio and TV audience, for a certain radio or TV format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
Additionally, KRRiT initialized the consultation among business activities in the licensed area. It is difficult to predict what will be the outcome, and how it will affect the results and operations of the Company and the Group.
Additionally, there is a risk that, the Group may not fulfill the disposition of concession or regulations, especially in relation to programme content or cease the broadcasting of the programme which may result in sanctions from KRRiT.
It cannot be ruled out that KRRiT will refuse to grant the concession the Group again, after the time for which they had been granted previously, or the conditions of newly granted concessions (or contracts related to those concessions) will be less beneficial from the Group's perspective.
Radio stations
Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora Group's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 53

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2016 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Additionally, radio stations compete for audience with other media, especially with Internet.
Television
Due to the purchase of 41.04% stake in Stopklatka S.A. by Agora on March 12, 2014 the Group entered television market. Our television channel competes with existing television broadcasters and potential new market entrants. Among Stopklatka TV competitors there are larger broadcasters with better brand recognition and financial resources than us. Stopklatka competes also with other media, including Internet oraz growing popularity of VOD services and other platforms enabling watching video materials in Internet.
In 2015, a subsidiary company of Agora S.A. ­ Green Content won a concession proceedings for broadcasting a TV channel via digital terrestrial platform in signal of eighth multiplex. The new TV channel ­ METRO was launched on 2nd of December, 2016. There is no certainty that the programme offer of our new TV channel will be attractive for a sufficient number of viewers. An additional difficulty is the need for technical adjustment of antennas and TVs of some clients to multiplex the eighth. A proper share in TV audience is a key parameter taken into account in the process of allocating advertising budgets of the largest advertisers. After the execution of the investment agreement on cooperation with Discovery Polska sp. z o.o. in December, 2016 the results of Green Content Sp. z o.o. are consolidated on the equity basis.
Movie business
Movie distribution and co-production is of project nature, which may result in volatitility of its results ­ it may also impact the Group's results. The majority of costs incurred, especially those related to movie co-production, burdens the Group results long before the profits related to that fields of operations. The impact of this activity on the Group's results depends also on the popularity of given film production.
Risk of claims as a rusult of intellectual property rights infringement
The Group's activity is based in its many aspects on using the intellectual property rights and on license agreements. In the Group's opinion it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of the third parties. However, it cannot be ruled out that the Group may unintentionally violate such laws. As a result the Group could be a subject of claims and could be forced to pay relevant compensations.
Risk of rapid changes in law regulations, especially those relating the Group's operations
Due to the fact that legal regulations in Poland change quite often, they may negatively impact the Group's operations and carry risk in business operations. This risk is especially associated with regulations that directly influence the day-to-day business, including those related to the provions on deconcentration of media businesses, changes to the Broadcasting Act and the regulations implementing those changes, Copyright and related rights Act, as well as acts regulating capital market in Poland.
New regulations may pose a risk due to the problems with their interpretation, lack of judicial practice, unfavourable interpretations adopted by courts or public institutions. Additionally tax regulations in Poland are subjetc of often changes. Changes in VAT and other kinds of tax burden may negatively impact the operations and financial results of the Group. The Group is also a subject of risk in changes of tax rules interpretation by tax organs which may affect operations and financial results of the Group.
Impairment tests
Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated).

Starting from the third quarter 2013, Management Board members of the Company participated in an incentive program for the period of 2013-2015 ("Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan").
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members were specified in the Supervisory Board resolutions.

Incentive Plan, that is from the third quarter of 2013 till the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with its assumptions, Three -Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2013-2015 was settled in cash in the second quarter of 2016. The realization of the plan resulted in the total payment of PLN 1,628 thousand.
Incentive Plan for years 2016-2017
Starting from the second quarter 2016, Management Board members of the Company participate in a new incentive program, on the basis of which, they will be eligible to receive an annual bonus based on two components described below: (i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The
EBITDA target is specified as the EBITDA result (being the sum of operating profit/loss and amortization and depreciation) to be reached in the given financial year determined by the Supervisory Board. The amount of potential bonus depends on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the given financial year; (ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the Incentive Plan will depend on the percent of Company's share price increase in the future. The share price increase will be calculated as a difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the first quarter of the financial year commencing after the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IQ") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the fourth quarter of the financial year preceding the financial year for which the bonus is calculated ("the Average Share Price IVQ"). If the Average Share Price IQ will be lower than the Average Share Price IVQ, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the bonus in this component of the Incentive Plan will not be granted.
The bonus from the Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of a non-market condition, which is the continuation of holding the post of the Management Board member during the year, for which the bonus is due.
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for the Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are specified in the Supervisory Board resolution.
As at 31 December 2016, the fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target for 2016 and was charged to the Income Statement.
The fair value of the potential reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2016, the value was charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the vesting period of the Incentive Plan.
The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the estimated cost of the Incentive Plan charged to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:
