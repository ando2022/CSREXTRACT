MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ACTION S.A. (the Company) ON THE OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR 2011
1. Basic figures and development prospects for the next business year
In the business year 2011 the Company ACTION S.A. reported sales revenues of PLN 2,758,421 thousand, an operating profit of PLN 48,077 thousand and the net profit of PLN 34,398 thousand. When comparing the current results with those realised by the Company in the previous year, the substantial increases in each of the above mentioned items is significant. Compared to the previous year, revenues from sales increased by nearly 34%, operating profit by 46% and net profit by as much as 48%. In 2011, the Company saw a significant increase in sales and in net return. In line with previous announcements and a consistent policy in this respect, the Management Board continuously aimed at creating a more efficient and effective operating model for ACTION S.A. as well as for the whole Group. In effect, there was a significant increase in revenues and profits despite the consequences of the financial crisis still affecting the Company's operations as well as the effect of all related turbulences in business and financial markets throughout Europe. When analysing achievements realised in the previous year, the Management Board has observed real opportunities of continuing the growing sales trend in the forthcoming year and, consequently, the Company achieving high sales dynamics, preserving at the same time return ratios at similar level.
In the Management Board's opinion, the main reasons confirming the aforesaid statements are:
1) Regarding internal factors: a) extension of the sales offer owing to entering into new distribution agreements with, among others, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo; b) maintaining a wide base of recipients representing all sales channels; c) entering into new sales agreements, including in particular agreements with the largest players in the telecommunications industry and Media Saturn Holding Polska; d) further increase in export and inter-community supplies; e) maintaining high warehouse efficiency; f) maintaining strict current monitoring of costs in the Company and in the Group; g) current monitoring and active working capital management; h) further results optimisation in the ACTION Capital Group entities through improved use of their potential and competences;
2) Regarding external factors: a) economic situation in Poland and world-wide, and their influence on the behaviour of the financial institutions; b) utilisation of EU funds by Polish companies, both public and private entities; c) budget situation in Poland, especially activities aimed at reducing the public finance deficit; d) macroeconomic and political situation in the world, particularly in the context of current political and economic crises; e) expected growth in the demand for television sets, tablets and smartphones owing to forthcoming sporting events.

ACTION S.A.

2. Material risk factors related to the Company's activities
2.1. Risk factors related to the Company's operation
2.1.1. Stock maintenance risk The Company's core business consists in selling technologically advanced products which are naturally exposed to the risk of becoming outdated causing a decrease of individual values. By launching new models, producers reduce the prices of products already available on the market. Due to the price protection clauses in agreements with suppliers and the standing market practice in this scope, the Company receives compensation for losses related to the decrease of stock value from all the key suppliers. Regardless of benefits obtained from price protection mechanisms, the Company strives to ensure high rotation of the stocks maintained.
2.1.2. Risk of losing receivables Trade receivables are the most significant item in terms of value in the Company's assets. As any entity involved in trading, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some of its receivables. This risk increases as the economic slowdown advances on the domestic and global markets. Having regard to potential loss of receivables, the Company takes out insurance against this risk with leading insuring companies.
2.2. Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates
2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation of Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. Dealers' willingness to buy new IT equipment and consequently the value of purchases carried out by the Company's customers is to a large extent related to the GDP growth, the level of investments and the way in which retail customers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.
2.2.2. Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ACTION S.A. obtains over 90% of its sales revenues in Polish zloty while about 50% of goods are imported. Over a half of payments made for imported goods is made in US dollars while the remaining are settled in Euro. In the long run this risk is constrained by the prospects of joining the Eurozone. However, at present the repercussions of the financial crisis are still being observed, leading to increasing fluctuations of the exchange rate of PLN to EUR and USD. The Company strives to minimise the risk related to its business activities; for instance, in 2011 it has adopted the Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. The principles of f/x risk management set forth in the policy indicated optimum hedging levels with relation to existing currency items and the related monitoring and controlling system based on three units. Furthermore, in accordance with the adopted accounting principles, the Company has undertaken to maintain hedges at a level close to 100% of the open foreign exchange position.
2.2.3. Legal environment risk Changing legal provisions or various interpretations thereof pose a threat to the operations of ACTION S.A. Certain amendments to the provisions of the law may have a negative impact on the Company's operations. Such amendments may affect the legal environment of the Company's operations to a considerable degree. Coming into force of a new regulation of material importance for trading may involve interpretation ambiguities, inconsistent decisions of the courts or unfavourable interpretations adopted by public administration authorities, etc.
2.2.4. Tax policy risk The Polish tax system is characterised with frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of them are not defined clearly enough and there exist few unequivocal interpretations Interpretations of tax provisions are subject to frequent change and unfortunately tax-related decisions made by both fiscal authorities and courts are inconsistent. As a result of divergent interpretations of tax regulations, a Polish company incurs greater risk than a company operating under more stable tax systems. In such circumstances the Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements and tax returns may be deemed at variance with tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. However, it is expected that two-instance proceedings at administrative courts and the acquis communautaire will have a considerable impact on the uniformity of court decisions on tax-related matters and as a result on uniform application of the tax law, also by the fiscal authorities. One of the elements of the risk related to legal regulations
___________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 2

(all the figures are provided in thousand zloty unless specified otherwise)

ACTION S.A.

concerns the limitation period established for tax liabilities, which involves the possibility to verify whether the tax liabilities for the relevant period were calculated in a correct manner. Income statements specifying the amount of the tax liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by way of control by the fiscal authorities in the course of five years from the end of the year during which the tax payment date passed. In the event the fiscal authorities interpret the tax regulations on the basis of which the tax liability is calculated differently than that of the Company, it may have a material negative impact on the Company's operations, its financial standing and consequently on its results and growth prospects.
3. Corporate governance principles
ACTION S.A. is subject to the corporate governance principles "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies" adopted by Resolution No. 12/1170/2007 of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 4th April 2007, the text hereof is included in the annex to the above mentioned resolution. Corporate governance principles are available at the WSE website (www.corp-gov.gpw.pl) and the Company's website(www.action.pl). Application of the principles under discussion is voluntary. A statement concerning the application of corporate governance principles by ACTION S.A. in 2011, constituting an appendix to this Report, shall be published as a separate component of the Annual Report.
4. Identification of material proceedings pending before court, competent arbitration authority or public administration authority
As at the day of submitting this Report, no proceedings were ongoing at any courts, authorities competent for arbitration proceedings or public administration authorities in relation to the Company's liabilities or receivables whose value, determined separately for individual proceedings and in total for all the proceedings, would represent at least 10% of the Company's equity.

Both the structure of the Company's recipients and suppliers show a large dispersion.

15. Evaluation of financial resources management

Liquidity ratios Current ratio (current assets / current liabilities) Quick ratio (liquid current assets / current liabilities) Acid ratio (short-term investments / current liabilities)

2011 1.16 0.61 0.01

2010 1.15 0.66 0.01

The liquidity ratios presented by the Company are typical for the best distribution-profile companies of the trade sector. The parameters of liquidity ratios in 2011 remained at last year's level, which is considered optimal for the distribution-oriented Companies operating in the trade sector. A slight decrease in the quick ratio is a result of an increase in inventory due to the need to maintain a high dynamics of revenue growth.

12.74%

The data presented above indicate that the quick increase in the value of current assets is financed mainly through non-interest bearing liabilities rather than by debt, at the same time, the rate of the increase in the value of current assets is significantly greater than the increase in the value of current assets. Consequently, both the increase of the value of bank loans as well as their percent share in the financing structure are very secure owing to the use of the Company's creditworthiness.

The continuing favourable financial standing is also confirmed by debt ratios with the following values:

Total debt ratio Equity to assets ratio

70.16% 29.84%

A slight increase in the debt ratio at the end of 2011 was caused by a very dynamic increase in sales which was observable throughout the year. The debt structure analysis based mainly on trade liabilities as well as a still high share of own funds in the financing of assets have allowed us to state that the Company's financial position is very good.

16. Evaluation of the possibility of executing intended investments

Considering the Company's high creditworthiness as well as growing return on its activities, the Management Board has very positively assessed the possibility of carrying out potential intended investments.

17. Evaluation of the factors and untypical events influencing the result of operations

Aside from the still high level of foreign exchange rates fluctuations, the effect on which is hedged by hedge accounting, the Company did not record any material factors of untypical nature during the period covered by this Report.

18. Description of the external and internal factors significant for the Company's growth

Factors significant for the Company's growth are described in Section 2 to this Report.

19. Changes to the basic principles of the Company management

In 2011, the Company has considerably changed its attitude to foreign exchange risk management. The Management Board introduced a new foreign exchange risk management policy setting forth, among others, the following principles:
1. Continuous monitoring of foreign exchange items and constant adaptation of hedge levels. 2. Split of controlling and supervising competences between three independent departments within the
Company: Furthermore, the Company has introduced hedge accounting principles as an element aimed at levelling the impact of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates on the Company's results through reflecting the effects of differences between payment deadlines on liabilities and goods outflows.

20. Agreements concluded between the Company and the persons managing it

Members of the Management Board of ACTION S.A., i.e. Piotr Bieliski and Kazimierz Lasecki, performed their obligations under employment contracts until 31st August 2010. Until then any compensation which might have been due with respect to their performance or dismissal were regulated by the provisions of the labour law. As at 1st September 2010, the basis of remuneration paid to the indicated persons on account of performed functions was changed from employment contracts to resolutions of the Supervisory Board. Possible compensation which may be due to both members of the Management Board in the case of dismissal is a five-month remuneration. Edward Wojtysiak performs his obligations on the basis of a "Management Contract" regulating mutual relations connected with the performance of his obligations as Member of the Company's Management Board. This contract does not contain any provisions which might lead to changes in the shareholding structure in the future. This contract does not provide for any compensation in the case of removal from the Company's Management Board. On 8th August 2011, Kazimierz Lasecki resigned from the position of Vice-President of the Management Board.
