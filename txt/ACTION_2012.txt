MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ACTION S.A. (the Company) ON OPERATIONS IN 2012
1. Basic figures and development prospects for the next business year
In the business year 2012 the Company ACTION S.A. reported sales revenues of PLN 3,494,349 thousand, an operating profit of PLN 67,369 thousand and a net profit of PLN 48,075 thousand. When comparing the current results with those realised by the Company in the previous year, each of the above mentioned items showed a double-digit increase. Compared to the previous year, revenues from sales increased by nearly 27%, operating profit and net profit by as much as 40%. The above figures indicate a continuation of the growing sales trend in 2012, occurring during a noticeable decline in national economic activity plus a still unstable economic and budget situation in most Eurozone countries. Preliminary estimates for development prospects for 2013 suggest that sales will continue to grow and net return ratios will remain stable.
In the Management Board's opinion, the main factors influencing the fulfilment of forecasts are:
Regarding internal factors: a) extension of the sales offer owing to entering into new distribution agreements, including, in particular the agreements with Dell, HTC, Whirlpool and Fujitsu Siemens, b) maintaining a wide base of customers representing all sales channels, c) planned development of activity in the area of high-volume recipients, d) a further increase in exports and intra-Community supplies, e) maintaining high warehouse efficiency, f) maintaining strict current monitoring of costs in the Company and in the Group, g) current monitoring and active management of working capital, h) further results optimisation in the ACTION S.A. Capital Group entities through the improved use of their competences.
Regarding external factors: a) economic situation in Poland and worldwide, b) budget situation in Poland and in Europe, especially activities aimed at reducing the public finance deficit, c) macroeconomic and political situation in the world, d) maintaining high demand for mobile IT devices.

ACTION S.A.

2.1.1. Stock maintenance risk The Company's core business consists in selling technologically advanced products which are naturally exposed to the risk of becoming outdated, causing a decrease of individual values. By launching new models, producers reduce the prices of products already available on the market. Due to the price protection clauses in agreements with suppliers and the standing market practice in this scope, the Company receives compensation for losses related to the decrease of stock value from all key suppliers. Regardless of benefits obtained from price protection mechanisms, the Company strives to ensure high rotation of stocks maintained.

2.1.2. Risk of losing receivables Trade receivables are the most significant item in terms of value in the Company's assets. As any entity involved in trading, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some of its receivables. This risk increases as the economic slowdown advances on the domestic and global markets. Having regard to the potential loss of receivables, the Company takes out insurance against this risk with leading insuring companies.

2.2. Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates

2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation of Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. Dealers' willingness to buy new IT equipment and consequently the value of purchases carried out by the Company's customers is to a large extent related to the GDP growth, the level of investments and the way in which retail customers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.

2.2.2. Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ACTION S.A. obtains over 70% of its sales revenues in Polish zloty while about 50% of goods are imported. Payments for imported goods are made mainly in USD and in EURO. In the long run this risk is constrained by the increasingly clear prospects of joining the Eurozone. At present; however, we can still observe high exchange rate volatility. The Company strives to minimise the risk related to the above. In 2011 it adopted the Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. The principles of f/x risk management set forth in the policy indicated optimum hedging levels with relation to existing currency items and the related monitoring and controlling system based on three units. Furthermore, in accordance with the adopted accounting principles, the Company has undertaken to maintain hedges at a level close to 100% of the open foreign exchange position.

2.2.3. Legal environment risk Changing legal provisions or various interpretations thereof pose a threat to the operations of ACTION S.A. Certain amendments to the provisions of the law may have a negative impact on the Company's operations. Such amendments may affect the legal environment of the Company's operations to a considerable degree. Coming into force of a new regulation of material importance for trading may involve interpretation ambiguities, inconsistent decisions of the courts or unfavourable interpretations adopted by public administration authorities, etc.

2.2.4.

Tax policy risk

The Polish tax system is characterised by frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of them are

inadequately defined and there exist few unequivocal interpretations. Interpretations of tax provisions

are subject to frequent change and, unfortunately, tax-related decisions made by both fiscal authorities

and courts are inconsistent. As a result of divergent interpretations of tax regulations, a Polish company

incurs greater risk than a company operating under more stable tax systems. In such circumstances the

Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements and tax returns may be deemed at

variance with tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. However, it is anticipated that the two-instance

proceedings implemented at administrative courts and the acquis communautaire will contribute

significantly to the uniformity of court decisions in tax cases and, as a result, to the uniform application of

the tax law, including by fiscal authorities. One of the elements of the risk related to legal regulations

concerns the limitation period established for tax liabilities, which involves the possibility of verifying

___________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 2

Management Report of ACTION S.A. for 2012
(all amounts given in thousand zloty (PLN '000) unless indicated otherwise)

ACTION S.A.

whether the tax liabilities for the relevant period were calculated in a correct manner. Income statements specifying the amount of the tax liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by way of control by the fiscal authorities at any time during the five years from the end of the year during which the tax payment date passed. In the event that the fiscal authorities interpret the tax regulations on the basis of which the tax liability is calculated differently than that by the Company, it may have a material negative impact on the Company's operations, its financial standing and consequently on its results and growth prospects.
3. Corporate governance principles
ACTION S.A. is subject to the corporate governance principles: "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies" adopted by Resolution No. 12/1170/2007 of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 4 April 2007, the text hereof is included in the annex to the above mentioned resolution. Corporate governance principles are available at the WSE website (www.corp-gov.gpw.pl) and the Company's website(www.action.pl). Application of these principles is voluntary. A statement concerning the application of corporate governance principles by ACTION S.A. in 2012, constituting an appendix to this Report, shall be published as a separate component of the Annual Report.
4. Identification of material proceedings pending before court, competent arbitration authority or public administration authority
As at the day of submitting this Report, no proceedings were ongoing at any courts, authorities competent for arbitration proceedings or public administration authorities in relation to the Company's liabilities or receivables whose value, determined separately for individual proceedings and in total for all the proceedings, would represent at least 10% of the Company's equity.
5. Information on the basic commodity lines offered by the Company and their share in the total sales
The basic scope of the Company's activity is the distribution of computer hardware and software. The Company's sales volume reflects the market situation and customers' needs. Based on long-standing market experience, the Company flexibly reacts to any changes that occur in the demand structure in order to meet the constantly increasing requirements of its customers.

The quick increase in the value of current assets is slightly less dynamic that the accompanying increase in sales revenues (26.7%). Current assets of the Company are financed mainly through noninterest bearing liabilities (above 70%) while debt constitutes only 14% of such financing. The increase in the value of current assets is significantly greater than the increase in the value of working capital. Consequently, both the increase in the value of bank loans as well as their percentage share in the financing structure are small and very secure owing to the use of the Company's creditworthiness.

An invariably favourable and very stable financial standing is also confirmed by debt ratios with the following values:

Total debt ratio Equity to assets ratio

Debt ratios

2012 70.80% 29.20%

2011 70.16% 29.84%

The debt structure analysis confirms a still high share of own funds in the financing of assets and has allowed us to state that the Company's financial position is very good and stable.
