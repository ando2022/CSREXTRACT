Dear Shareholders,
2013 was a year of further cost optimization measures and simultaneous work on new projects leading to the growth of revenues and profitability improvement. We undertook these actions to face feeble growth of Polish economy which resulted in the decrease of expenditure for advertising and entertainment. It was especially visible in the businesses which are the core of the Agora Group business operations. Additionally, it accelerated the structural changes in media market and migration of users from traditional to digital media.
The actions undertaken in 2013 brought improvement of operating result and new development directions for the coming years which aim at growth of revenues and profitability improvement.
In the beginning of 2014 we announced how we are going to achieve these objectives.
First, we have to execute effectively digital transformation of its print media operations. Taking example from the world publishers who implemented successfully metered paywall. We would like to attract ca 40 thousand of paying digital subscribers with its offer till the end of 2014.
Second, we want to build a significant position in TV market. On March 15, 2014 Stopklatka TV - a TV channel created together with Kino Polska TV S.A. - started broadcasting. After almost 25 years of business operations Agora entered TV market. For us it is on the one hand a chance to complete Group's portfolio of media and on the other chance to reach for advertising revenue from the largest segment of advertising market. We will look for possibilities to grow further our presence in TV market.
Third, we plan to develop our businesses not related to the press. The priority for our online operations is an intensive growth in mobile and video as well as further diversification of revenue streams. We plan to invest in content and mobile applications which help Agora outperform the market in display advertising. We want to be more active in search for new revenue sources by means of organic growth and acquisition of start-ups.
The aspiration of the Agora Group is to create the most common cinema network, increase the scale of cinema movie distribution and releasing the first film production as the lead producer in 2015. In the outdoor business Agora wants to strengthen its position in the premium panel segment. Construction of 1 580 bus shelters in Warsaw will be an important step in execution of this strategy. The Company plans participation in similar projects in other Polish cities. The main objective of our radio business is to improve profitability. Its organic growth is dependent on the number of available licences. The Group's objective is to successfully acquire the largest possible number of them in order to grow technical reach of current radio stations, optimization of music formats and building the model of distribution of audio content online
Fourth, in the coming years, apart from the profitable growth of its key segments, we plan a set of optimization initiatives related to the Group's cost of shared functions and infrastructure.
In our opinion execution of the set tasks in the coming years will facilitate successful transformation of the Group's operations, leading to growth of efficiency and the business scale. This in turn should result in the growth of value for shareholders.
Simultaneously, delivering our mission, we would like to become the first and natural choice for its users and business partners, to whom our businesses deliver credible information and quality entertainment, as well as innovative solution for business partners to reach their clients.
We would like to thank all shareholders, clients and employees for support and trust in Agora and our readers and listeners for interest and feedback.
The Management Board of Agora S.A.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2013 and for the year ended thereon

(g) Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 4 April 2014.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union. Information about standards and interpretations, which were published and become effective after the balance sheet date, including those awaiting endorsement by the European Union, is presented in point (ae).
(b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine, which functional currency was hryvna - UAH). All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the companies from continuing their business operations. The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2012, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2013, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effecitve: 1) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income; 2) IAS 19 (2011) Employee Benefits; 3) Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities; 4) Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First ­ time Adopters; 5) IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Entities; 6) Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes - Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets; 7) IFRIC Interpretation 20: Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine; 8) Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time adopters - Government Loans; 9) Improvements to IFRS (2009-2011).
The application of the amendments to IAS 1 resulted in presenting the foreign currency translation reserve in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future. The application of the amendments to IAS 19 results in recognizing the actuarial gains and losses related to the revaluation of the retirement severance provision in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Due to an immaterial impact of this change on comparative information, the Group did not restate the comparative amounts. According to the Group IFRS 13 has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements since the methods and assumptions currently used to measure the fair value of assets are consistent with the standard.
According to the Group assessment, the amendments to other standards have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2013 and for the year ended thereon

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by Agora S.A. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounter for as equity transactions.
(ii) Associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. The investments in associates are accounted using the equity method. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.
(iii) Joint-ventures
Joint-venture is an entity which is joinlty controlled by the dominant party or major investees and other shareholders or cooperators on the basis of the statute, company's act or the agreement signed for the period longer than one year. The investments in joint ventures are accounted using the equity method. An interest in a jointly controlled entity is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the venturer's share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity. The profit or loss of the venturer includes the venturer's share of the profit or loss of the jointly controlled entity.
(iv)Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint-ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the jointventure.
(v) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equal to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point w).

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is usually as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.
In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, except for some special projects related to distribution and co-operation rights for movies and computer games, in case of which the consumption of economic benefits may significantly differ from the straight line approach and the pattern of consumption of economic benefits in particular periods can be reliably determined based on generated revenue.
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets (apart from acquired magazine titles) are usually between 2 and 15 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument ("host contract") and whether the agreement that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.

(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised. At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses, whether there is objective evidence of impairment of financial assets. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the asset`s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted with the effective interest rate. Changes in impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of shortterm profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.
(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine ­ which functional currency is hryvnia). Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.

(o) Equity
(i) Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii) Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii) Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv) Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses, including reserve capital accumulated from prior years profits. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 and the recognition of the put option given to the non-controlling shareholders.
(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.
Deferred income tax is provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.

(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-asyou-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method. Changes in the value of the liability are recognized in profit or loss, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.
(s) Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants from the disabled fund
The Group's subsidiary (AMS S.A,) receives grants from the state to fund acquisition of fixed assets, which are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto (related to employment of disabled persons). The grants are recognised in the income statement as other operating revenues on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.
(u) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties.
(i) Sale of goods
Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably.
(ii) Sale of services
Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided.
(iii) Interest income
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method).
(iv) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over its useful life, but no longer than the lease term. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets as described in point (d).
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.
(z)Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Share-based payments
In Agora Group the share incentive plans fueled by Agora S.A.'s shares are run. These plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment" which came into force from 1 January 2005.
Eligible employees are entitled to purchase investment certificates in closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates is determined by applying valuation model, which takes into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates is included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates is established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased. The costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Within the Agora Group there are also 3-Year-Long Incentive Plans carried out, described in note 27B. One of the components of the plans is accounted for in accordance with IFRS2. These are cash-settled plans with rules based on inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In these plans, eligible employees of the Agora Group (including the Management Board) are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Agora S.A. during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are presented in salaries and renumeration.
(ab)Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.

(ac)Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.
(ad)Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operates in a Special Economic Zone. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption is recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The Amendments do not introduce new rules for offsetting financial assets and liabilities; rather they clarify the offsetting criteria to address inconsistencies in their application. The Amendments clarify that an entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off if that right is:
- not contingent on a future event; and - enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity
and all counterparties.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
2) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 10 provides a new single model to be applied in the control analysis for all investees, including entities that currently are Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in the scope of SIC-12. Under the new single control model, an investor controls an investee when (1) it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvements with the investee, (2) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that investee and (3) there is a link between power and returns.
The new standard also includes the disclosure requirements and the requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. These requirements are carried forward from IAS 27 (2008).
The Group does not expect the new standard to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the assessment of control over its current investees under the new standard is not expected to change previous conclusions regarding the Group's control over its investees.
3) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures. Under the new Standard, joint arrangements are divided into two types, each having its own accounting model defined as follows:
-a joint operation is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as the joint operators, have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement; - a joint venture is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as joint venturers, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

Under IFRS 11, jointly controlled entities treated as joint ventures, must be accounted for using the equity method. Proportionate consolidation is no longer possible.
The Group does not expect the new standard to have material material impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the assessment of the joint arrangements under the new standard is not expected to result in a change in the accounting treatment of existing joint arrangements.
4) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IFRS 12 requires additional disclosures relating to significant judgements and assumptions made in determining the nature of interests in an entity or arrangement, interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard on the level of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
5) IAS 27 (2011) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
IAS 27 (2011) carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 27 (2008) for separate financial statements with some minor clarifications. As well, the existing requirements of IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 for separate financial statements have been incorporated into IAS 27 (2011).
The Group does not expect the amendmetns to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
6) IAS 28 (2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Venutres (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
There are limited amendments made to IAS 28 clarifying that IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations should be applied to an investment in ssociates and joint ventures if they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Besides, previously, IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 specified that the cessation of significant influence or joint control triggered remeasurement of any retained stake in all cases, even if significant influence was succeeded by joint control. IAS 28 (2011) now requires that in such scenarios the retained interest in the investment is not remeasured.
The Group does not expect the amended standard to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
7) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Transition Guidance (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The amendments clarify the requirments for the initial application of these standards.
The Group does not expect the amendmetns to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
8) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The Amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirements in IFRS 10 and require qualifying investment entities to measure their investments in controlled entities ­ as well as investments in associates and joint ventures ­ at fair value through profit or loss, rather than consolidating them.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the Group does not qualify as an investment entity.
9) Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The amendments will not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the Group does not apply hedge accounting.
10) Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later).

The amendments clarify that recoverable amount should be disclosed only for individual assets (including goodwill) or cash-generated units for which an impairment loss was recognised or reversed during the period. The amendments also require the additional disclosures when an impairment for individual assets (including goodwill) or cash-generated units has been recognised or reversed in the period and recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to disposal. The Group does not expect the amendments to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009), Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) and Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015 or later)
The new standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, about classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. One of significant changes relates to the changes in classification categories of financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets will be classified into one of two categories: - financial assets measured at amortized cost; or - financial assets measured at fair value. The standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The amended IFRS 7 requires to disclose more details about the effect of the initial application of IFRS 9, when an entity does not restate comparative information in accordance with the amended requirements of IFRS 9.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard and its amendments on the consolidated financial statements.
2) IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)
The Interpretation provides guidance as to the identification of the obligating event giving rise to a liability, and to the timing of recognising a liability to pay a levy imposed by government.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3) Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits entitled Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2014 or later)
The amendments apply to contributions from employees or third parties to defined benefit plans.
The amendments will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, since the existing defined benefit plan has no contributions from employees.
4) Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2014 or later)
The Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 contain 8 amendments to 7 standards and the Improvements to IFRS 20112013 contain 4 amendments to different standards, with consequential amendments to other standards and interpretations.
The Group analyzes the impact of the new standard and its amendments on the consolidated financial statements
5) IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2016 or later)
The interim Standard that permits first time adopters of IFRS to continue to use its previous GAAP to account for regulatory deferral account balances both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements.
The standard will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements, because the Group has no regulatory accounts.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996.
IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Company to be restated by applying the general price index.
Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Company with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount.
Consequently, the restatement of share capital due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Company, only the structure of the equity is affected.
Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies).
Consequently, due to lack of impact on equity of the Company following the hyperinflationary adjustment and lack of regulations in polish law, the Company did not post any adjustment to equity as a consequence of IAS 29 application.

13. RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER RESERVES
Dividends
Retained earnings may be distributed subject to regulations, stipulated in the commercial companies' code and according to dividend policy announced by the Company.
Frame dividend policy announced by the Company on 14 February of 2005 provides for return of excess cash to shareholders through annual dividend and ­ if the situation warrants ­ share repurchases (with cancellation) in connection with the Company's perspectives and market conditions.
For the financial year of 2012, Agora S.A. made a net loss of PLN 23,341 thousand, which was distributed in accordance with the resolution taken by the General Meeting of Shareholders (on June 28, 2013) from the reserve capital.

21. SALES AND OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
(a) Operating segment information
In these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, information on operating segments are presented on the basis of components of the Group that management monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Operating segments are components of an entity, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in the process of decision making regarding allocation of resources and assessing the performance of the Group.
For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services, and has six reportable operating segments as follows:
1) the Newspapers segment includes the Group's following activities: Special Projects (including book collections) and publishing of Gazeta Wyborcza as well as Metro (including operating activities of the Agora's Printing Department and Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., which print also these two newspapers),
2) the Cinema segment includes the Group's activities within the cinema management of Helios S.A. and film distribution activities of Next Film Sp. z o.o. comprising multiplexes as well as traditional cinemas.,

Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Operating results of reportable segments do not include: a) revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior
reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments, b) amortisation recognised on consolidation (described below).
Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income tax are managed on a Group level and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on the market basis in the manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Reconciling positions show data not included in particular segments, inter alia: other revenues and costs of Agora's support divisions (centralized IT, administrative, HR functions, etc.) and the Management Board, Agora TC Sp. z o.o., intercompany eliminations and other matching adjustments which reconcile the data presented in the management reports to the consolidated financials of the Agora Group.
Operating depreciation and amortisation includes amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets of each segment.
Amortisation recognised on consolidation can be defined as consolidation adjustments, inter alia: the amortisation of intangible assets and adjustments to property, plant and equipment recognised directly on consolidation.

27. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
During periods covered by these financial statements, the following incentive plans were carried out in the Group:
A. Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments, B. Incentive Plans based on realization of operating result goal and share price increase (from 2010).

A. Incentive plan based on equity-settled share-based payments (carried out from 2005)

Eligible employees participate in an incentive plan based on investment certificates in a closed end mutual fund designated to service the plan and managed by Towarzystwo Funduszy Inwestycyjnych Skarbiec S.A.

The number of certificates granted depends on meeting performance criteria, not on market conditions.
In the first half of 2013, the Company ended the realization of incentive plans based on investment certificates (launched in 2012).
In 2013 a new Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments (investment certificates) has not been launched.

The fair value of certificates was determined by applying valuation model, which took into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, which were disposed on behalf of the investment fund, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund type of transferred shares and rights and limitations associated with the certificates. Consequently, the discount factor was established at the level of 23.6% (detailed description of the valuation model is disclosed below).
The fair value of certificates was established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates were purchased by the eligible employees.
Historical ratio of forfeited certificates (FR ratio, described below) adjusted the number of certificates granted included in the calculation of incentive plan cost (due to non-compliance with conditions attached to the scheme obligation to work in the Group, in particular).
The fair value of investment certificates and the total cost of the Group as at the grant date were determined using the following formula:

FMV = (B-S@grant date) x (1-CD), Cost = FMV x IC x (1-FR) where:
1. FMV - fair market value of certificate as at the grant date,
2. B-S@grant date - the value of certificates as at the grant date, calculated using Black - Scholes model (BS), with following assumptions:
a. the value of certificates as at the grant date was determined as 6 month European call option for Agora's shares as at that date,
b. parameters of B-S model:

In 2013, non-cash expense of the investment certificates acquired by the Management Board, recognised according to IFRS 2, amounted to PLN 90 thousand (in 2012: PLN 255 thousand).
B ­ Incentive plans based on realization on operating result goal and share price increase
In the period of 2010-2012, the eligible employees of the Company (the Management Board and top managers) participated in incentive program ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan" for the period of 2010-2012) based on two components: the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Group ("the EBITDA target") and the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"), which are described in consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2012.
The fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target. The fair value of the provision for the cost of potencial reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model).
In accordance with its assumptions, 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the period of 2010-2012 was settled in cash in the second quarter of 2013. The realization of the plan resulted in the payment of PLN 3,048 thousand.
Starting from the third quarter 2013, eligible employees of the Company (Management Board members) participate in a new incentive program based on two components ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan" for the period of 2013-2015) described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The target is based on the accumulated operating EBITDA (excluding some adjustements, for example related to business combinations) to be reached in the years 2013-2015. The amount of potencial reward depends on the stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the period of 2013-2015. If the stage of achieving the target will be up to 70%, the EBITDA target is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan,
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan will depend on the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2016 till March 31, 2016 ("the Reference Share Price") adjusted by: (i) the accumulated dividend per one share, to which the shareholders will be eligible in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 and (ii) the adjustments resulting from the share-buy back program in the period of April 1, 2013 till March 31, 2016 ("the Share Price for Reward Calculation"). If the Share Price for Reward Calculation will be lower than PLN 9.9, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan.
The reward for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of other conditions, which are non-market conditions (for example: continuation of the employment within the Agora Group, holding the post of Management Board member).
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are described in the Supervisory Board resolution.
The fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target and is charged to the Income Statement over the whole period of the Incentive Plan, in proportion of the actual accumulated EBITDA operating level of the Group (excluding any adjustments) reached from January 1, 2013 till the balance sheet of the current financial statements in the estimated value of the operating EBITDA target.
The fair value of the provision for the cost of potencial reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date.

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk,
liquidity risk,
market risk,
operational risk.
This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 % of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
Investments
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in liquid securities.
Guarantees
The information on guarantees and promissory notes are descibed in note 37.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as at December 31, 2013, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 14. Payment deadlines concerning trade payables are described in note 20 and for credits and loans in note 14.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises and credits which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,707 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2012: PLN 811 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 9,818 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2012: PLN 1,226 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 11,147 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2012: PLN 8,502 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk by entering into long-term hedging contracts. However, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to three months.
Agora S.A. has not been or was in 2013 engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).

Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group's operations.
The Group's objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of possible financial losses and possible damage to the Group's reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas:
requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions,
requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions,

compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements,
documentation of controls and procedures,
up-to-date analysis of the causes of operational results and setting remedial actions if a operational loss appeared or the probability of happening significant operational risk,
training and professional development,
ethical and business standards,
risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Compliance with Group's standards is supported by a programme of periodic reviews undertaken by Internal Audit. The results of Internal Audit reviews are discussed with the management of the business unit to which they relate, with summaries submitted to the Audit Committee and senior management of the Group.
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.

Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits, credits and loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2013, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the impact of changes in fair value of financial instruments is estimated at the level of net loss/profit of PLN 344 thousand (as at December 31, 2012: PLN 93 thousand).

b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables, payables and bank loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at 31 December 2013, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to have an immaterial effect on profit or loss (as at December 31, 2012: PLN 524 thousand).

Key assumptions that are most significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy include: discount rate and the estimated level of the EBITDA. In case of the put option granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., an increase of the estimated EBITDA level over the period specified in put option conditions by 10%, would cause an increase of put option liability by ca PLN 3,400 thousand, while an increase of the discount rate by 1pp, would cause a decrease of the liability by ca PLN 1,300 thousand.

Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the

41. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the cash flow forecasts have been prepared.
There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and
2) pre-tax discount rate.

Basic information about the method applied is summarized below:

AGORA GROUP MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(MD&A) FOR YEAR OF 2013 OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REVENUE PLN 1,073.9 MILLION NET PROFIT PLN 1.2 MILLION OPERATING EBITDA PLN 104.9 MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 109.5 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2013, while comparisons refer to 2012. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.
I. IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FINANCIALS OF THE GROUP [1]
In 2013, revenues of the Agora Group ("Group") decreased by 5.7% yoy to PLN 1 073.9 million.The main reasons are lower by 14.5% yoy advertising revenues at PLN 544.3 million and copy sales revenues at PLN 134.0 million (down by 12.2% yoy). Due to the drop in admissions, the Group's revenue from ticket sales decreased by 3.7% yoy to PLN 129.1 million. In 2013, growing by 23.6% yoy to PLN 266.5 million revenues from other sales positively influenced the level of the Group's revenues. The growth of other sales results mainly from higher by 25.5% yoy sales of printing services to external clients and revenues generated from film distribution and co-production in the amount of PLN 12.7 million. In 2013, total net operating cost of the Group decreased by 7.4% yoy and reached PLN 1 066.5 million. This is a positive result of restructuring measures implemented in 2012, including group lay-offs in Agora S.A. (,,the Company", ,,Agora"). The Company would like to underline that in 2012 the operating cost of the Group was burdened with the cost of group lay-offs in the amount of PLN 9.5 million. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Group suffered asset impairment losses in the amount of PLN 17.6 million. It influences the comparability of selected entries in the Group's profit and loss account. Cost savings result mainly from lower staff cost (down by 7.1% yoy). The marketing and promotion expenditure was lower by 19.5% yoy ­ the largest cuts were observed in the Newspapers and Magazines segments. A 4.5% yoy drop in external services contributed positively to the decrease of the Group's operating cost and resulted mainly from lower yoy production cost in the Magazine segment and lower maintenance cost of outdoor panels in AMS due to matching of panel portfolio to market needs and lower maintenance expenditures. In 2013, operating EBITDA of the Group increased by 26.1% yoy to PLN 104.9 million. EBIT grew to PLN 7.4 million. Net profit amounted to PLN 1.2 million and the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent amounted to PLN 0.5 million. The Group draws attention to the fact that the yoy comparability of data was disturbed by one-off costs in 2012 (the asset impairment losses and group lay-offs). At the end of December 2013, the Group's cash and short-term monetary assets amounted to PLN 171.4 million, out of which PLN 99.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and PLN 71.8 million in short-term securities. Additionally, PLN 40.0 million provided by the subsidiary AMS S.A. is treated as a cash collateral securing the bank guarantee issued in relation to the concession contract for construction of bus shelters in Warsaw (presented as long ­ term receivables). At the end of December 2013, the Group's debt amounted to PLN 145.9 million (including: external debt of Helios group consisting of bank credits and finance lease liabilities in the amount of PLN 102.7 million).

In 2013, the Group's revenues amounted to PLN 1,073.9 million and decreased by 5.7% yoy. The Group recorded a yoy decrease of sales revenues in majority of its business segments. The growth of revenues was observed in the Cinema segment, mainly due to the growth of cinema network in 2012 and initiation of the film distribution business by Next Film Sp. z.o.o., a subsidiary company of Helios S.A.
In 2013 as a result of significant decrease of advertising expenditure in Poland the Group's advertising sales decreased by 14.5% yoy and amounted to PLN 544.3 million. This largest drop of advertising revenues took place in the Newspapers segment. The growth of advertising revenues was observed only in Cinema segment.
In 2013, the Group's total revenues from the copy sales amounted to PLN 134.0 million and went down by 12.2% yoy. The main reason for this decrease are lower revenues from the copy sales of the Magazine segment, resulting from the changes in the portfolio of titles published by the segment and lower yoy number of copies sold. Additionally, lower number of copies sold of Gazeta Wyborcza negatively influenced the level of copy sales. Lower dynamics of the decrease in revenues from copy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza, in comparison with other reporting periods, results from the cover price increase of Gazeta Wyborcza introduced twice in 2013.
In 2013, the revenues from tickets sold in the cinemas composing the Helios network decreased by 3.7% yoy to PLN 129.1 million. In the discussed period of time, people bought over 7.5 million cinema tickets in the Helios network, i.e. 2.8% less yoy. At the same time, the total estimated number of cinema tickets sold in Poland decreased by 5.6% yoy [2].
Other revenues amounted to PLN 266.5 million and increased by 23.6% yoy. The main contributor were higher sales of printing services for external clients and PLN 11.0 million of film distribution revenues.

(1) excluding non-cash cost of share-based payments and cost of group lay-offs.
Total net operating cost of the Group, in 2013, decreased by 7.4% yoy to PLN 1,066.5 million, mainly as a result of restructuring measures implemented in the Group in 2012. It should be remembered that in 2012 the total net operating cost of the Group was burdened with the asset impairment losses of PLN 17.6 million and group lay-off cost in Agora S.A. Agora Poligrafia Sp.z o.o. of PLN 9.5 million.
The decrease in the cost of external services in 2013 results, inter alia, from lower system maintenance cost in the Outdoor segment as a result of changes in the portfolio of panels and consistent decrease of panel maintenance cost. The second factor contributing to the decrease of external cost is lower cost of film copy purchase in the Cinema segment due to lower number of tickets sold in the discussed period of time.
The Group's staff cost decreased by 7.1% yoy in 2013. It is a result of restructuring measures executed in 2012, including group lay-offs. The slight growth of staff cost in Outdoor segment results from better yoy execution of sales targets. The decrease of staff cost was observed in the Dailies, Magazines, Radio and Internet segments. Despite the growth of Helios cinema network, the yoy growth in the segment's staff cost was insignificant.
The Group's headcount, at the end of December 2013, was 3,088 employees and was higher by 3 FTEs than at the end of December 2012. The growth in headcount results from initiation of development projects in the second half of 2013 in Newspapers and Internet segments. The average headcount in the Agora Group in 2013 amounted to 3,038 FTEs and was lower by 304 FTEs in comparison with average headcount in 2012.
Total non ­ cash expense relating to share - based payments (described in note 27A to the consolidated financial statements of the Group) charged to the Group's profit and loss account in 2013 amounted to PLN 1.4 million.
The Group offers its employees other incentive plans (for example: cash motivation plans, incentive plans in sales departments etc.), which cost is charged to the Group's staff cost. Since the third quarter of 2013, the Group's operating result is burdened quarterly by the accrued cost of Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the Management Board members for the period of 2013 - 2015 (described in note 27B to the consolidated financial statements of the Group). In 2013 this cost amounted to PLN 0.6 million.
The drop in the cost of raw materials, energy and consumables in 2013 as a result of lower unit cost of paper.
Promotion and marketing expense decreased in 2013 by 19.5% yoy, mainly due to the savings in this cost position observed in Newspapers, Magazines and Internet segments.

3. PROSPECTS 3.1. Revenue 3.1.1. Advertising market[3]
The situation of the advertising market in Poland is dependent on the condition of Polish economy. The value of the Polish advertising market may stop declining when the condition of Polish economy improves. The first symptoms of improvement in Polish economy were already visible in the fourth quarter of 2013. The forecast regarding the growth of Polish GDP in 2014 range from 2.5% to 3.0% growth rate. Taking into account positive signals from Polish economy, the Company estimates that in 2014 the growth by 0-2% yoy of advertising expenditure in Poland. The largest beneficiary of the expected growth in advertising expenditure will be TV. The Company is of the opinion that the value of TV advertising shall grow by ca 1-4% yoy. The second medium to benefit most from the uplift in the advertising market shall be internet. The Company estimates that online advertising may grow by ca 5-8%. The value of radio advertising may grow by ca 0-3% yoy and cinema advertising by ca 2-5% yoy. The value of outdoor advertising may range from possible drop of 1% yoy to growth of 2% yoy. According to the Company's estimates, advertisers shall further limit their budgets dedicated to press. The value of advertising expenditure in dailies will decrease by ca 20-24% and in magazines by ca 9-13% yoy.
3.1.2 Copy sales
In 2014, negative trends relating to copy sales of dailies and magazines shall continue. The Company believes that the copy price increase of Gazeta Wyborcza, introduced in the beginning of 2014 partially offset the decline in revenue from copy sales of the daily. Simultaneously, the Company develops the sales of its digital content. In the beginning of 2014 it implemented metered paywall and digital subscription offer. In the long term perspective these actions should result in the growth of digital subscription sales.
3.1.3 Ticket sales
The most important factor influencing the level of admissions in Poland is film repertoire in a given year. Having analysed available data the Company is of the opinion that the number of cinema tickets sold in Poland in 2014 should grow yoy.
3.2. Operating cost
In 2014, the Group plans to introduce development projects in selected business segments which may influence the level of the Group's operating cost. The segments with largest projects include Press and Internet segments.
3.2.1 Cost of external services
The cost of external services shall be dependent on the cost of film copies for the cinema business related directly to ticket sales revenues, EUR/PLN exchange rate and cost of brokerage services. Additionally, this cost position may increase due to the openings of two new cinemas in the first half of 2014 and execution of other development projects.
3.2.2 Staff cost
In 2014, the Group plans execution of development projects which may influence the level of staff cost. The projects that will influence this cost position the most will be run in Newspapes and Internet segments. They are mainly related to the digital transformation of the business model of the Group's press operations, including implementation of metered paywall and development of digital subscription offer. In Internet segment the growth of staff cost is related to the strengthening of the sales team.
3.2.3 Promotion and marketing cost
In 2013, the promotion and marketing cost were lower yoy. However, it should be remembered that the level of promotion and marketing expense depends on the dynamics of particular media segment performance, as well as the number of development projects (including openings of new cinemas) and the market activities and projects of the Group's competitors. Due to these facts the Group's promotion and marketing expense in 2014 may grow yoy.

3.2.4 Cost of raw materials and energy
In 2013, the cost of raw materials and energy decreased by 1.6% yoy. The Group's activities in the field of printing services for external clients have the largest impact on this cost position. The level of this cost position, in 2014, will be dependent mainly on the price of newsprint, the volume of production and EUR/PLN exchange rate. Therefore, this cost position may grow yoy in 2014.
4. THE GROWTH DIRECTIONS OF THE AGORA GROUP
The primary objective is the growth in media sector. Agora wants to achieve the objective by the growth of revenues and profitability improvement. The key to success is execution of four main tasks: 1) digital transformation of print media operations, 2) building position in the TV market, 3) profitability improvement of the Group's key business segments, 4) cost optimization of the Group's shared functions and infrastructure. Due to the implementation of the metered paywall on "Gazeta Wyborcza's" website on February 4th, 2014 the process of digital transformation significantly accelerated. In order to achieve that goal, the Group wants to support development of quality journalism and build necessary technological tools. On March 15, 2014 the Agora Group entered the TV market launching Stopklatka TV - a TV channel created together with Kino Polska TV S.A. Agora's objective is a quick success of the digital film channel and its aspires to build a significant position in the TV thematic channel market in the long term perspective. Agora plans to develop its other business segments. The Group aims to grow its cinema network Helios and increase the scale of operations in the field of film distribution and co-production. In the outdoor business Agora wants to strengthen its position in the premium segment. The priority for the Group's online operations is an intensive growth in mobile and video as well as further diversification of revenue streams. The Group's objective in the radio business is to successfully acquire the largest possible number of licences in order to grow technical reach of current radio stations and optimization of music formats. The Agora Group plans also a set of optimization initiatives related to the Group's cost of shared functions and infrastructure in order to simplify and unify internal processes.

The Company would like to stress, that cost of group lay-offs and one-offs in Newspapers segment affects the yoy comparability of data in 2013. The one-off cost in 2012 included the impairment loss on the assets in the Special Projects division and it amounted to PLN 2.2 million.
In 2013, the operating EBITDA of the segment amounted to PLN 78.9 million and the operating EBITDA margin reached 16.0% [1]. It is mainly the result of 6.6% yoy drop in the Newspapers segment sales.
1. GAZETA WYBORCZA 1.1. Revenue 1.1.1. Copy sales and readership [4]
In 2013, Gazeta Wyborcza maintained its leading position among the quality newspapers. Gazeta Wyborcza sold 220 thousand copies on average (down by 14.1% yoy). In the discussed period of time, Gazeta's revenues from copy sales decreased only by 5.8% yoy, which was possible due to two increases in basic price of daily issues of Gazeta Wyborcza. In the discussed period of time, the weekly readership of Gazeta Wyborcza stood at 10.6% (3.2 million readers; CCS, weekly readership index), which placed it as the second daily among nationwide dailies.
Additionaly, growing by 9.2% yoy sales of Gazeta Wyborcza's magazines (m.in. Wysokie Obcasy Extra, Ksiki. Magazyn do czytania) positively affected the level of the segments's revenues.
1.1.2. Advertising sales [3]
In 2013, Gazeta's net advertising revenue (including display advertising, classifieds and inserts) amounted to PLN 144.2 million (down by 28.9% yoy).
The above figures include a portion of revenues from dual-media advertising offers (published both in print as well as on GazetaPraca.pl, Komunikaty.pl verticals and Nekrologi.Wyborcza.pl website), which is allocated to the print edition of Gazeta Wyborcza.
In 2013, the ad spend in dailies in Poland decreased by almost 29.5% yoy. In the discussed period of time, Gazeta's revenues from display advertising decreased by almost 31% yoy, and its estimated share in display ad spend in dailies stood at almost 36.0% (down by ca 1.0pp yoy).

1.1.3. Other revenues
Segment consistently uses its spare production capacity to grow revenues from the sales of printing services to external clients. In 2013 revenues from the sales of printing services rose by 25.5% yoy, mainly due to higher revenues from the printing services in heatset technology.
1.2. Cost
In 2013, the operating cost of the segment decreased by 5.1% yoy to PLN 441.5 million.
One should bear in mind that operating cost of the segment in 2012 was affected by additional cost associated with the group lay-offs and the impairment loss on the assets in fourth quarter of 2012. Total additional cost, which affected the operating result of the segment in 2012, due to these events, amounted to PLN 8.5 million.
In 2013 the reduction in the segment's operating cost was achieved by the decrease in the staff cost by 8.8% yoy as a result of lower employment. Lower promotion and marketing cost (down by 20.0% yoy), due to the reduced scope of Gazeta Wyborcza's promotional activities, contributed positively to the drop in the operating cost.
The newsprint cost of Gazeta Wyborcza and its supplements in 2013 amounted to PLN 38.6 million and decreased by 28.0% yoy.

In 2013, the cost of the campaign execution decreased by 10.1% yoy as a result of a smaller number of printing services and lower cost of posting and distribution of posters. The reduction in the maintenance cost by 6.3% yoy is a result of optimization measures. AMS adjusted its portfolio of advertising panels to the market requirements, and consistently lowered unit maintenance cost per panel. In addition, a significant reduction in rental cost for advertising panels in metro cars, as a result of the execution new contract in May 2013, contributed to the cost reduction. Lower D&A cost is a result of full amortization of selected panels and the process of optimization of network of advertising panels. The operating result of the segment was affected by the positive result on other operating cost, as a result of the closing of several administrative disputes on placing ad panels on the waysides without a proper permission. AMS group recorded an increase in staff cost as a result of increased variable component of remuneration due to higher yoy execution of sales targets. Slight increase in promotion and marketing cost in 2013, mainly results from larger scope of social campaigns and joint non-profit/commercial campaigns. The non-profit element of these campaigns is settled in barter and charged to promotion and marketing cost.

2. COST
In 2013, the operating cost of segment decreased by 42.9% yoy to PLN 41.5 million. The comparability of the data yoy is influenced by the one-off cost and group lay-offs in Agora S.A., which burdened the results of 2012 with PLN 12.9 million. The disposal of the right to publish Poradnik Domowy had a significant impact on the segment's operating cost. The gratest savings yoy were recorded in the cost of materials, energy, consumables and printing services, mainly as a result of lower production volume of existing titles in the Group's portfolio. The promotion and marketing cost of segment was significantly reduced yoy due to the decrease in the number of promotional campaigns mainly in TV.
3. NEW INITIATIVES
In the first quarter of 2013, Agora S.A. sold to Edipresse Polska S.A. the right to publish the monthly Poradnik Domowy for PLN 11.5 million. At the same time, Agora S.A. acquired from Edipresse Polska S.A. the right to publish monthly Dom & Wnetrze for PLN 3.0 million. The transaction's objective was to increases Agora's presence in interior decoration and construction segment and let the Company compete for advertising budgets of the producers of luxurious furniture and articles of interior decoration.
In 2013, Agora launched a new application enabling SamsungApps users to download free of charge digital editions of Dziecko. The monthly Dziecko is also available digitally for iPad and iPhone users (AppStore). Agora also launched a new application enabling iPad users to download digital editions of Avanti.
In line with the readers' expectations, new versions of: Cztery Katy, Avanti, Logo and Dom & Wnetrze were introduced. The purpose of those changes is to increase the copy sales and ad revenues of the titles.
In November 2013, the sales forces of press brands of the Company were merged. As a result , the advertising offer of all press brands of the Group is prepared by one team commencing since January 2014. The offer includes Gazeta Wyborcza, Agora's magazines, the daily Metro, their digital editions and MetroMSN.pl portal.

In this MD&A Agora has corrected the TV market figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 and Internet advertising market figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 and in the first, second and third quarter of 2013. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, print and radio advertising market data referred to herein are based on Agora's estimates adjusted for average discount rate and are stated in current prices. Given the discount pressure as well as advertising time and space sell-offs, these figures may not be fully reliable and will be adjusted in the consecutive reporting periods.

Internet ad spend estimates include display, search engines (Search Engine Marketing), e-mail marketing and video advertising since the first quarter of 2012. Outdoor advertising figures are based on Izba Gospodarcza Reklamy Zewnetrznej estimates [8]. The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on the average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media. [4] The data on the number of copies sold (total paid circulation) of daily newspapers is derived from the National Circulation Audit Office (ZKDP). The term "copy sales" used in this MD&A is consistent with the sales declarations of publishers to the National Circulation Audit Office. The data on dailies readership are based on PBC General, research carried out by MillwardBrown on a random, nationwide sample of Poles over 15 years of age. The CCS index was used (weekly readership index) - percentage of respondents reading at least one edition of the title within 7 days of the week or preceding research. Size of the sample: nationwide PBC General for January-December 2013: N = 42,109; Warsaw (Masovian district and cities of over 500 thousand inhabitants): January-December 2013: N =1,752.

The Management Board of the Company might recommend to Agora Holding Sp. z o.o. the list of employees and the number of certificates for the purpose of motivation plans. All final decisions regarding the incentive plans in Agora (number of participants, grant of certificates and sale conditions) were made by Agora Holding Sp. z o.o.

10. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SELECTION AND AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH AN AUDITOR ENTITLED TO AUDIT FINANCIAL REPORTS

11. INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Information about financial statements in respect of: risk: price risk, credit risk, material disruptions to cash flow and risk of liquidity problems, on which the Company is exposed and objectives and methods of financial risk management
is disclosed in notes 34 and 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
Macroeconomic risk
Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2013, advertisers spent 5% yoy less on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure only in Internet (by 7.5% yoy). Other media suffered further erosion of advertising expenditure: dailies down by almost 29.5% yoy, magazines down by 13.5% yoy and outdoor by almost 14.0% and cinemas down by almost 11.5% yoy. Additionally, ad spends in TV were lower by over 3.5% yoy.
On the basis of the current macroecomic situation as well as on the advertising market, the Company estimates that in 2014 the value of advertising market in Poland will grow by 0-2% yoy. Additionally, it should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 45

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2013 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
Seasonality of advertising spending
The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's advertising revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year.
Cinema revenues are subject to seasonality ­ revenues earned in the second and third quarters are usually lower than in the first and fourth quarters.
Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market
The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting nearly half of the advertising market expenditure (almost 49.5%) in 2013. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held almost 21.0% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted over 9.0% and almost 5% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2013, over 6.5% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted over 7.5% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted almost 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current Company's estimates of advertising market growth in 2014 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.
Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.
Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. At the same time, the Group digitalizes its content and on February 4, 2014 the Company introduced system of metered paywall on websites related to Gazeta Wyborcza. Nowadays, it is hard to evaluate the impact of new access system on the Group's revenue. The Group also publishes a free daily ­ Metro. We cannot predict how the global changes occurring on the press market will influence the free press position and consequently, the position and the results of the Group.
Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive. Number of internet users in Poland is not growing so fast as in the past. Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged. Additionally, online advertising market is undergoing transformation. Search advertising, dominated in Poland by one player, is becoming more popular among advertisers. The Group's main source of Internet advertising revenue
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 46

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2013 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
is display advertising. Video and mobile advertising are growing their share. Maintenance of the strong position in rapidly changing market requires investment in advanced technological solutions. Due to that fact there is no guarantee that the Group will be able to compete with national and foreign players with larger financial resources.
Outdoor Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result. On Decmeber 18, 2013, a consortium of AMS SA - Ströer Poland Sp. z o.o. signed a concession contract with the City of Warsaw for the construction and operation of bus shelters in Warsaw. Parties of the consortium decided that AMS shall accrue all the outlays related to the investment process, the maintenance cost related to bus shelters and future revenue from the utilization of bus shelters. The subject of the concession contract is construction of 1,580 bus shelters in Warsaw. The investment process shall last 3 years and shall commence in 2014. The estimated cost of the bus shelters' construction, according to the capital city of Warsaw, amounts to ca PLN 80 million. The duration of the contract is nearly 9 years. The timely execution of the contract carries risk related to the necessity of acquiring a number of approvals and administration decisions. Additionally, in such a competitive and changing environment the macroeconomic and and market assumptions necessary for the project success may not materialize.
Cinema Helios group opens new cinemas mainly in shopping centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish Real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators. Additionally, the available repertoire affects results of cinema business. Lack of interesting movies, abilities to promote movies or the quality of movies may negatively affect cinema admissions. Moreover, economic downturn may translate into lower expenditure on entertainment which may result in lower revenues from ticket sales and willingness to buy food and beverages in cinema bars.
Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, cable networks, Internet, home cinema systems or DVD, which may decrease popularity of cinema going.
Risks of running licensed business The Group comprises local radio stations broadcasting under the brands Zlote Przeboje and Roxy FM (Rock Radio since January 31, 2014) and superregional radio TOK FM. Radio broadcasting in Poland is licensed. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted. There is a risk that demand, from listeners, for a certain radio format may decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
Radio stations Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.

Television Due to the purchase of 41.04% stake in Stopklatka S.A. by Agora on March 12, 2014 r. the Company enetered television market. Our television channel competes with existing television broadcasters and potential new market entrants. Among Stopklatka TV competitors there are larger broadcasters with better brand recognition and resources than us. The increasing success in Poland of DTH, cable and DTT providers will likely result in the increasing fragmentation of Polish TV viewing audiences, which may make it more difficult for us to persuade advertisers to purchase airtime in Stopklatka TV. The results of Stopklatka shall be consolidated on the equity basis.
Movie business Movie distribution and co-production is of project nature, which may result into volatitility of its results ­ it may also impact the Group's results. The majority of costs incurred, especially those related to movie co-production, burdens the Group results long before the profits related to that fiels of operations. The impact of this activity on the Group's results depends also on the popularity of given film production.
Impairment tests Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.
Currency risk The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the printing services, uslugami IT, purchase of production materials, mainly newsprint, and gadgets inserted in magazines, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
Interest rate risk The changes in interest rates may influence the level of the Group's financial cost related to the Group's debt.
Risk of losing key employees The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
The risk of collective dispute On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o., Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. and AMS S.A. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.
13. FACTORS AND UNUSUAL EVENTS WHICH HAD INFLUENCE ON THE RESULTS OF BUSINNESS ACTIVITIES FOR 2013 WITH THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR INFLUENCE
A positive impact on the Agora Group results had initation of film distribution activities and co-production of two movies. Total revenues from the film distribution and co-production generated PLN 12.7 million revenues.
Moreover, further limitation of ad expenditure in 2013 had a negative impact on the Group's results as 50.7% of the Group's total revenues came from advertising. A negative factor influencing the Group's revenues has been
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 48

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year 2013 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
also the worldwide trend of declining copy sales which affected Gazeta Wyborcza and magazines published by Agora.
14. LEGAL ACTIONS CONCERNING LIABILITIES OR DEBTS OF THE ISSUER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH AMOUNT IN SINGLE OR IN TOTAL TO AT LEAST 10% OF THE AGORA'S SHARE CAPITAL
In 2013, there were no legal actions against Agora S.A. or its subsidiaries related to their liabilities or debts whose total value would amount to at least at 10% of Agora's share capital in a single or in all legal proceedings.
15. DIVISIONS OF THE COMPANY AND OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
Agora S.A. has 19 divisions and the major headquarters in Warsaw. Other companies from the Group do not have divisions.
16. THE MANAGEMENT BOARD'S STATEMENT OF THE REALIZATION OF FORECASTS
The Management Board did not publish any forecasts of the Company's financial results and because of that this report does not present any Management Board's statement of the realization of them, as well as any differences between actual and forecasted financial results.
17. ISSUING OF SECURITIES
In 2013 the Company did not issue any securities.
18. OTHER INFORMATION
