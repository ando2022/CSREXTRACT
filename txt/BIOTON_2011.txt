In 2011 the balance sum of the Company increased by 20.8% (by 325.7 million PLN). Total fixed assets increased by 28.9% (by 353.2 million PLN). As regards the value the increase of the fixed assets was strongly influenced by the change of evaluation of loans granted to subsidiaries nominated in USD and EUR was related to the increase of the foreign exchange rate and the increase of:
 tangible fixed assets, by 20.8% (55.8 million PLN) to the level of 323.6 million PLN, which was mainly caused by the increase of outlays for fixed assets under construction,
 investments in affiliated companies and subsidiaries by 65.4% (155.7 million PLN), which was mainly caused by the acquisition of shares in BIOLEK Sp. z o.o.,
 deferred income tax assets related to the increase of unsettled tax loss.

Current assets of the Company have decreased by 8% (27.5 million PLN). The change of the sum of current assets was significantly influenced by:
 the decrease of the inventories level by 5.2 million PLN, which was mainly connected with optimization of the efficiency of the level of supplies,
 the decrease of the value of short-term financial assets by 13.8 million PLN to the amount of 15.9 million PLN, being the result of a set-off of a short-term loan granted to company HLST with the liabilities towards this company in the amount of 5 million USD,
 the decrease of cash and cash equivalents to the level of 11.5 million PLN, including 20.9 million PLN which have been released from the reserved account with regard to fulfilling of the conditions precedent of the agreement concluded by the Company with Bayer Healthcare Company Ltd of 09.07.2009.
Fixed assets to current assets ratio was 83% to 17% of the balance sum. The increase of share of fixed assets in the structure of the balance sheet for 2011 as compared with the previous year results from the investment in BIOLEK Sp. z o.o., the increase of outlays for fixed assets under construction and the increase of the evaluation of loans in foreign currencies.

Equity capitals of the Company increased by 12.9% to the level of over 1.471 billion PLN, which was mostly influenced by the increase of the share capital by 249.7 million PLN.
The share of equity capitals in the structure of liabilities has decreased to the level of 77.8%.
Within liabilities there is observed the increase of long-term liabilities by 35.3 million PLN, mainly resulting from:

In 2011 the short-term liabilities increased almost two times, by 122.5 million PLN (90.8%). Their share in the structure of liabilities in the balance sheet increased from 8.6% to 13.6%, mainly due to:
 the increase of liabilities from supplies and services and other by 62.4 million PLN (85.3%), mainly resulting from the purchase of shares in BIOLEK in the amount of 53.3 million PLN, resulting from the settlement of acquisition and future liability concerning the payment of bonus,
 the increase of liability from credits, loans and debt instruments by 53.1 million PLN, mainly due to contracting a new debt financing in a financial institution,
 the increase of the item "Other accruals" by 7 million PLN, mainly due to establishment of cost provisions for the expenditures for management and legal service.

3. Description of significant risks and threats with determination to which extent BIOTON S.A. is exposed to them
The risk related to rejection or delay in admitting Group's products for trading
New products of the Group may be admitted for trading on a given market only after obtaining proper approval according to the binding legal regulations, and the permissions to trade a product are given for a specified time and require prolongation. Preparation of documentation necessary to obtain such permission for a given product, especially in some of the markets, requires a lot of work and is time consuming. The procedure of obtaining such permission or its prolongation may turn out to be very time consuming. These reservations concern in particular the procedure of central registration of biotechnological products, which may be additionally prolonged due to frequent changes of regulations and interpretation doubts related thereto. The above factors may result in significant delays in introduction of new products for trading by the Group. Refusal or delay of permission to trade with the Group's products may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to side effect, interactions with other drugs or quality defects of a given product of the Group.
It cannot be excluded that during application of a medicine, after it has been approved for trading, there shall occur unpredictable side effects as well as interactions with other drugs. Such situations can also take place with participation of the medicines available on the market for some time already and may cause certain actions to be initiated by appropriate authorities. For instance in Poland, should there be proven an unexpected, severe, adverse side effect of a medicinal product, threatening human life or health, no declared therapeutic efficiency or a risk inadequate to the therapeutic effect, the Minister of Health withdraws the permission for admission to trading. Moreover, in case of a justified suspicion that a medicinal product does not comply with the requirements defined for such product, the provincial pharmaceutical inspector issues a decision on putting on hold trading of specified batches of a medicinal product, on the territory of his operation. Existence of any of the above factors may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ average.
The risk of non-performance of the intended results of the development works within the field of biotechnological products
A significant part of the Group outlays is spent for financing development works, including development of biotechnological products. Development of operation in the biotechnological products market requires extensive investment outlays and the risk of not achieving the assumed results of development works within the scope of biotechnological products is much higher than in case of regular generic drugs. Failure of development works financed by the Company and the Group may cause the lack of possibility to regain the outlays through increased sale of biotechnological products developed in the result of the financed development works, which may have significant adverse effect on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to termination of the license for production of recombinant human insulin
One of the most significant products of the Group, i.e. recombinant human insulin is manufactured, distributed and sold under the licence provided to the Company on 03.06.1997. At present, after taking over the rights from Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly Bio-Technology General Corp.), the licensor is Ferring International Center S.A. The licence is valid on a given territory for 15 years, starting from the date of registration of recombinant human insulin, however not longer than until 31.12.2019. After expiry of the above mentioned terms concerning a given territory, the Company will not be bound by the provisions of the licence agreement, but it can still produce and sell the insulin. The licence agreement may be terminated by the licensor in case the Company breaches provisions of the said agreement and in case of circumstances which prevent further performance of the agreement. Any possible earlier termination of the licence agreement shall mean that the production and sales of one of the most
11

important products of the Group should be stopped, which may have negative effect on the operations, financial standing or operating results of the Group. Treat­ low.
Risk related to the strategy of commercialization of the Group's products on the key markets
Group's strategy within the scope of commercialization of products of the group on key markets is based on cooperation with international pharmaceutical concerns under long-term distribution agreements. It is not certain whether the sales volumes assumed by the distribution partner of the Group will be obtained. The outlays for marketing and sales of the products of the group incurred by distribution partners, their resources kept on selected foreign markets and expertise and experience within the scope of promotion and sale of pharmaceutical products on a given market may not be sufficient to gain the assumed sales volumes Considering the above there is no certainty that the activity of the Group on the foreign markets shall bring expected effects. It cannot be excluded that the distribution partners of the Group shall not be able to achieve their goals and their marketing strategy on the export markets shall not be effective. Existence of any of the above factors may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to the change of rules of refunding medicines
In most of the countries in which the Group operates, the market of medicines, including the refunded medicines, is regulated in detail by proper legal regulations. On the grounds of such regulations there is established a list of refunded drugs, the scope of refundation, including the prices, limits and grade of refund. Adverse changes of the legal regulations, for instance deletion of the medicinal products of the Group from the list of refunded drugs, introduction of a separate, increased limit of prices for refunding competitive products, change of the price limit or decrease of refunding grade of a given drug may have negative influence on competitiveness of the products of the Group, which may have adverse effect on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ average.
The risk of exchange rate
Significant part of the Company revenues comes from the export of medicines and an important part of the components necessary for production of medicines by the Group is imported. Due to the above a significant part of the Group revenues and the significant part of the costs is generated or incurred in foreign currencies. Moreover, most of the Company revenues from export are expressed in American dollars, while most of the imports are expressed in euro. The Group carries out operations in many markets where both the revenues and costs are incurred in foreign currencies. The Company also finances investments of construction of factories and the outlays for development works in the companies of the Group in the form of loans in foreign currencies. In case there is no balance between the costs and revenues, and in the view of the lack of the balance between the revenues and costs in the same foreign currency, fluctuations of foreign exchange rates may have significant negative effect on the operation, financial standing or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to changes of the legal regulations
The Group is vulnerable to the risk of changes in the legal and regulatory environment in the countries it operates in. The legal and regulatory environment in the countries it operates in have been and still is subject to frequent changes, and the regulations are not applied in the uniform manner by courts and public administration authorities. In case of the Polish market the scope of impact of such factors has been much extended due to the fact of Poland's accession to EU in May 2004, in the result of which Poland was obliged to adopt and implement all legal acts of EU and acquis communautaire (a set of rights and obligations, including judgments of the European Court of Justice binding for all EU Member States). Treat­ low.
4. Proceedings pending before court, institution for arbitration proceedings or public administration authority
The heirs of the former owners of the property "Dobra Macierzysz" (of the total area of 1,043,738 m2) applied to the Mazowieckie Voivodeship Office in Warsaw for announcing invalid the decision of the Head of the City and Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 15.04.1988 on taking two plots of the total area of 788.700 m2 over by the State Treasury. By the decision of 21.02.2002 the Mazowieckie Voivodeship Office refused to announce the decision in question invalid. On 01.12.2004 the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development revoked the decision of the Mazowieckie Voivode of 21.02.2002 and
12

discontinued the proceedings before the first instance authority. By the decision of 08.03.2005 the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has passed the case for consideration by the SelfGovernment Appeal Court in Warsaw. The above mentioned decision was appealed against by the Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics ("IBA"), however by the decision of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of 20.05.2005 the decision in question has been maintained in force On 21.06.2005 IBA lodged a complaint against the decision of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of 20.05.2005 to the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw. By the judgement of 03.02.2006 the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw the IBA's complaint has been dismissed. On 28.03.2006 IBA lodged a plea of nullity for the above mentioned judgement in the result of which the case was submitted again to the Mazowieckie Voivodeship Office.
In the beginning of 2010 there has been instituted a case before the Self-government Appeal Court ("SKO") concerning declaring invalid the decision of the Head of the City and Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 15.04.1988 on taking over, for the benefit of the State Treasury, of two plots of the total area of 677.600 m2 and the decision of the Head of the City and Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 19.03.1990 on entrusting Orodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy Biotechnologii [Biotechnology Research and Development Centre] in Warsaw with management of the real estate located in the village Macierzysz, of the area of 77 ha.
By the decision of 31.01.2011, SKO adjudicated that the proceedings concerning declaration of decision of the Head of the Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 15.04.1988 invalid is discontinued and forwarded the submitted motion to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas. The grounds for the above mentioned adjudication was that SKO found itself incompetent authority to consider the case.
Notwithstanding the above, by the decision of 31.01.2011, SKO adjudicated that the proceedings concerning declaration of decision of the Head of the Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 19.03.1990 invalid is discontinued. The grounds for the above mentioned decision was the fact that SKO had already refused to declare the decision invalid (adjudication of 19.03.1990).
In the opinion of the Company, in the present regulatory environment and in view of the up-to-date judicial decisions, and in particular in view of the decision of the Constitutional Tribunal of 20.02.1991, the probability that the potential claims of the heirs of the former owners of the property "Dobra Macierzysz" by appropriate authorities will be acknowledged seems slight. Should the adjudication be unfavourable to the Company, the Company shall be entitled to claim compensation from IBA, from which the Company acquired the right of perpetual usufruct of the real properties in question on the grounds of the agreements of 27.06.1996 and of 06.11.1997. IBA had stated, that it should be held responsible for all and any potential claims of third parties.

In 2011 the Company obtained revenues from domestic sales in the amount of 96.5 million PLN, which constitutes an increase by 5.9% as compared with 2010. The increase was mainly caused by the increased sales of insulin (dosage forms) and orally taken anti diabetic medicines and was the consequence of the increase of recipients' inventories due to changes in the regulations concerning refunding regulations. The sales of antibiotics and eye drops in 2011 was the effect of execution of the transaction of sales of the antibiotics part of the enterprise of the Company and constituted contractual production which expired at the end of 2011.

On 30.11.2011 BIOLEK Sp. z o.o. ("Biolek") and Beijing Smile Feed Sci. & Tech. Co. Ltd with the registered seat in Beijing, China ("Beijing Smile") concluded an annexe to the distribution agreement of 01.07.2011 ("Annexe"). The agreement in question concerns distribution in China of veterinary products manufactured by Biolek and applied in farming of pigs (Suilectin and Suiacid) and poultry (Birdacid). According to Beijing Smile's sales forecast, the value of the contract shall amount to 1.2 billion USD in the period 2012-2021 (with the assumption of gaining 10% share in the market in 10th year of sale). In the result of the conclusion of the Annexe Beijing Smile shall deal - beside sale and marketing in China also with manufacturing of the product Suilectin based on the active substance manufactured by Biolek. Suilectin shall contribute to e.g. shortening of the production period of pigs and increasing dead weight of animals, which are of significance as regards improvement of pigs farming profitability. It has been confirmed with the tests carried out with the use of Biolek's products by Beijing Smile during the recent months in China. Due to the fact that the product Suilectin shall be manufactured in China, this product shall be positioned in the Chinese market as a product manufactured locally. Due to specific selling preferences for modern feed stuff additives manufactured in China and due to very good results of tests carried out by Beijing Smile in China the local production shall contribute to: (i) acceleration of commencement of sale of Suilectin in China and (ii) shall allow - in the Beijing Smile's opinion - to significantly increase the target share in the market and proceeds from the sale of that product in the Chinese market. Beijing Smile is China largest manufacturer and distributor of phytase enzyme used in pigs and poultry farming, and as regards that product, holds approximately 50% share in the market.
On 30.11.2011 BIOLEK Sp. z o.o.

17. Assessment of factors and untypical events having influence on the Company' result for the accounting year, specifying the influence of such factors and untypical events on the results achieved
In 2011 the Company completed restructuring actions resulting from the changes in the Company's business environment, being a derivative of the fundamental revision of the Groups operating strategy commenced in 2009, in particular within the area of sales in the foreign markets of the main Company product- recombinant human insulin.
These operations focused on the following key areas:
1. consolidation of products portfolio aimed at the acceleration of the effects of commercialization of the key product of the Company ­ recombinant human insulin ­ and focusing of the research and development activity on the products with the highest market potential (growth hormone with the prolonged release),
2. reduction of operating costs, decrease of the demand for external financing and adjustment of the existing infrastructure to the new requirements of execution of the strategy in selected markets,
3. focusing the strategic operations of the Group on the specified key competences, i.e.:  manufacturing high quality biotechnological products,  research and development of new biotechnological products,  actions within the area of registration of biotechnological products in the key global markets for the purpose of their further commercialization in cooperation with the leading pharmaceutical concerns operating in the global market,
4. significant reduction of indebtedness and increase of the stability of the financing structure of the Group.
27

The effect of the strategy adopted was conclusion of a number of agreements (e.g. with Bayer Healthcare Company Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Ltd., Actavis Group PTC ehf), which affect or shall affect future operation of the Company and the Group.
The above actions are to intensify operations of the Company and the Group in other markets and realization of the adopted development strategy which would allow obtaining satisfactory financial results in the years to come.
18. Characterization of external and internal factors significant for the development of the enterprise of BIOTON S.A. and the Group and description of development perspectives of Company's and Group's operations at least until the end of 2012, taking into account the elements of market strategy worked out by them
18.1. Factors significant for the development of the Company and the Group
Range of Group's products
The range of Group's products includes recombinant human insulin, as well as other pharmaceutical products, including the biotechnological ones. Competition in the biotechnological products market is much lesser than in the markets of other pharmaceutical products due to significantly smaller number of competitors and significant barriers hindering entering this market. Margins in the market of biotechnological products are among the highest in the pharmaceutical market.
Confirmed expertise in development of biotechnological products and their introduction from the laboratory level to industrial production
The Company has got documented experience in development of biotechnological products. In 1997 it bought from the American biotechnological company - Bio-Technology General Corp. the licence for manufacturing human insulin with the use of patented, genetically modified bacteria strain E. coli, as well the technology of production of insulin and its dosage forms at laboratory scale. During the subsequent four years the Company developed production of the active substance and dosage forms of human insulin at full industrial scale and obtained registration in Poland. During the next years Company specialists worked over the increase of efficiency of the process of insulin production. Insulin production, due to its scale and sophistication level, is one of the most complicated processes of production of biotechnological products. Documented experience within the scope of development of highly efficient processes of production of biotechnological products is one of the most important competitive advantages of the Company.
Possibilities to develop new products
The Company and the Group are developing a range of new biotechnological and pharmaceutical products. Thanks to well-educated and experienced staff and cooperation with IBA it is probable that the planned extensive investments in development shall result in the introduction of new biotechnological products. Within the scope of development works of the Group there are continued the works over human growth hormone with prolonged release and insulin analogues.
High qualified and experienced specialists
BIOTON S.A., as the only Polish company manufacturing biotechnological products is able to attract key biotechnology specialists in Poland. The Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics is a leading research institute in Poland and employs highly qualified and experienced specialists. On the grounds of cooperation agreement with IBA the Company is to receive an offer for cooperation with regard to any new IBA project.
Strong marketing in Poland
The Company has developed second largest team for insulin marketing in Poland, consisting of over 80 people who are responsible for marketing and information of doctors and patients.
Cooperation aiming at entering new markets
According to the strategy of the Group the Indian, Russian and Chinese markets have got priority. The Company has decided to start cooperation with international pharmaceutical companies which have strong position in the local markets.
28

Insulin quality/modern production process
The Company is the only manufacturer of human insulin in Poland, and one of the few in the world, which use the process of recombination of DNA.
Insulin manufactured by the Company is a high quality product. Both the insulin and the injectors are manufactured following the GMP principles and comply with the European Farmakopeia. The analysis of insulin products is carried out with the use of the given chemical, biochemical validations and microbiological analytical methods. Production plants and quality control laboratories have implemented quality control system compliant with the EU guidelines.
18.2. Perspectives of development of the operation of the Company and the Group
In the opinion of the Managing Board, the year 2011 was the last year of organizing the Group and implementing the new strategy. It effects are visible in the results of both Group companies and the Company itself, which successively increases the sales of insulins and other diabetic products in Poland and in the main foreign markets, e.g. in China and Russia. The crowning achievement of the sales development strategy followed by the Company, based on cooperation with the biggest global pharmaceutical concerns in the key markets, was the conclusion on 30.01.2012 of the agreement with the concern Actavis Group PTC ehf, which shall ensure future high dynamics of sale of insulins e.g. in the European Union and the United States. In the opinion of the Managing Board of the Company, at the end of 2012 the Group shall acquire both significant operating profit and net profit, and based on the agreements which have already been concluded by the Company, there might be expected constantly growing profitability in the years to come. The results of the Group shall also be influenced positively by the sales carried out by BIOLEK Sp. z o.o. in the veterinary segment.

publish on its web site the regulations of the general meeting.

Before conclusion of any significant agreement with an affiliate, the Managing Board applies to the supervisory board for approval of the given transaction/agreement. The above obligation does concern typical transactions which are entered into under market conditions within the scope of operating activities of the Company with an affiliate in which the Company holds majority capital share. For the purpose of the present set of rules there is assumed a definition of an affiliate as provided for in the resolution of the Minister of Finance issued on the grounds of Art. 60 paragraph . 2 of the act of 29 July 2005 on public offering and conditions of introduction of financial instruments to organised turnover system and on public companies (Journal of Laws No. 184, item 1539 as amended).

Due to detailed provisions in the Company's Articles of Association, the Company may not accept the entire rule in question with the present reading. Pursuant to §21 paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association, the competence of the Supervisory Board shall include:
"2) granting approval to conclusion of agreements between Affiliates and the Company and performing other actions for Company's Affiliates, in case the value of such agreements or actions exceeds during consecutive 12 (twelve months) the amount of 500,000 EUR or its equivalent in other currencies, except for typical and routine actions taken under market condition between the affiliates, whose nature and conditions result from the current operating activity conducted by the Company or any of its affiliates."

Good practice applied by members of the supervisory boards

Beside the activities specified in the applicable legal regulations a supervisory board should:

 review and give opinions on matters being the subject matter of The Company shares the need to review and provide opinion on matters

resolutions of the general meeting.

being the subject matter of resolutions by the general meeting by the

supervisory board. However, the Company cannot guarantee, that it will

obtain opinion of the supervisory board on each matter that is to be the

subject matter of a resolution of the general meeting in time sufficient to

enable the stockholders to get acquainted with it. Sometimes it may be

required, due to practical reasons, that the general meeting is convened

quickly and the supervisory board itself will not have enough time to issue

opinion before the general meeting or to consult experts prior to issuing

the opinion.

A member of the supervisory board should provide the managing board of the Company with information concerning its links with a stockholder holding stocks which represent not less than 5% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting. The above obligation pertains to links of commercial, family or other nature, which may influence the position of the member of the supervisory board in a matter recognised by the board.

It is Company's opinion that it could not guarantee procedures enabling information on all links of "other nature" due to the ambiguity of this term. In the opinion of the Company, non-disclosure of such information shall not affect transparency of Company operations, due to Company's intent to apply the rules of corporate governance providing for that in case there is a conflict of interests or it is likely to take place, a member of the supervisory board should notify the supervisory board and refrain from participation in a discussion and voting in the case, with regard to which such conflict has occurred.

At least two members of the supervisory board should fulfil the criteria on independency from the company and other entities significantly affiliated to the company. As regards the criteria of independence of members of the supervisory board, there should apply Appendix II to the European Committee Order of 15 February 2005 concerning the role of nonexecutive directors or directors not being members of supervisory boards of listed companies and (supervisory) board committee. Notwithstanding the provisions of item b) of the aforementioned Appendix, a person who is not an employee of the company, a subsidiary or an affiliate cannot be deemed as fulfilling the criteria of independence referred to therein. Moreover, a link with a stockholder, excluding the independence of a member of the supervisory board as provided for herein, shall be actual

The Company acknowledges that good corporate governance should include independent members' participation in the supervisory board. Due to detailed provisions included in § 18 of the Company's Articles of Association, the Company may not accept the entire rule in question with the present reading. According to § 18 of the Company's Articles of Association:
"1. One of the members of the Supervisory Board appointed by the General Meeting should comply with all of the following conditions:

1)

Good practice applied by the stockholders

Representatives of mass media should have the possibility to attend general meetings.

In principle, the Company acknowledges the assumptions behind this rule and considers it a good corporate practice. In its operation the Company takes numerous actions aiming at maintaining good relations with mass media and carries out efficient information policy. However, one cannot exclude a situation where the Company does not provide the representative of mass media with a possibility to attend the general meeting due to the necessity to ensure efficient course of the session.

The rules of the general meeting shall not prevent the stockholders from participating in the general meeting and exercising their rights. Any amendments of the rules should become binding not earlier than starting from the next general meeting.

The Company practice to date, as well as the practice of many public companies does not confirm the need to introduce the rules of the general meeting that would specify in details the rules of carrying out the general meeting. Therefore, it is Company's opinion that the appropriate regulations of the Code of Commercial Companies should be sufficient grounds to efficiently conduct the general meeting in the Company, including voting in separate groups.
