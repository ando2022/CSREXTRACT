INTRODUCTION TO THE MAERSK GROUP REPORTING

Contents

The Annual Report for 2015 of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (further referred to as the Maersk Group or the Group) has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies.
Maersk Group has tailored the external financial reporting towards the needs of our different stakeholders with two annual publications.
The Annual Report has a focus on the detailed legally required information, whereas the Group Annual Magazine has a focus on providing an overview of key developments during the year. The reports can be read individually or combined depending on our stakeholders' interests. The Annual Report is available electronically in English on http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm

The Board of Directors of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S continues to consider the "Recommendations for Corporate Governance" implemented by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen. For further information see page 21 of this report.
Maersk Group publishes an independently assured Sustainability Report which covers main aspects of the Group's approach to sustainability. Additional information on how we manage issues, explaining implementation, progress and relevant commitments and frameworks can be found on the Sustainability website: http://www.maersk.com/en/the-maerskgroup/sustainability/reports/
Comparative figures Unless otherwise stated, all figures in parenthesis refer to the corresponding figures for the previous year.

The Group Annual Magazine provides an overview of the operations and performance of the Maersk Group in a concise and easy-to-read format. This publication is not a substitute for the Annual Report and does not contain all the information needed to give as full an understanding of the Maersk Group's performance, financial position and future prospects as provided in the Annual Report. The Group Annual Magazine is produced in English and Danish, both available in hard copy and for download on http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm

Maersk Group also produces Interim Reports for each of the first three quarters of the financial year.

To further add value focusing on the professional segment and others with more specific interests, detailed Presentations are available each quarter following the release of the Interim Reports and the Annual Report.

Maersk Group also hosts on a regular basis a Capital Markets Day which can be followed through a live webcast where the speakers' presentation slides can be accessed via links.

This extended information of Interim Reports, Presentations and webcasts can be found on our Investor Relations website: http://investor.maersk.com/

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015
GROUP HIGHLIGHTS
The Maersk Group delivered a profit of USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) and an underlying profit of USD 3.1bn (USD 4.5bn). After a satisfactory result in the first half of the year with a ROIC of 10.2%, Maersk Group was severely impacted by a widening supply-demand gap across most of our businesses, leading to significant oil price and freight rate reductions. ROIC for the second half of the year was negative 6.3%, impacted by impairments of USD 2.5bn after tax in Maersk Oil and for Q4 there was an underlying loss of USD 9m (profit of USD 1.0bn).
The Group delivered a strong cash flow from operating activities of USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn) for the year and USD 2.0bn (USD 2.4bn) in Q4, despite a significant decline in container freight rates and oil prices.

Contents

The demand for transportation of goods was significantly lower than expected, especially in the emerging markets as well as the Group's key Europe trades, where the impact was further accelerated by de-stocking of the high inventory levels. At the same time, the container transportation industry experienced a significant increase in new tonnage ordered two to four years ago on the back of higher economic growth expectations and a focus on larger and more fuel-efficient vessels. The combination of low demand and high supply increase led to sharp freight rate declines in the second half of 2015.
The Group's oil related businesses were similarly impacted by the increasing oil supply-demand gap combined with a signifi cant increase in oil supply from especially US shale and OPEC production. This resulted in a continued oil price decline in the second half of 2015, leading to significant layoffs and reduction of activities across the global oil industry.
The Group reacted to the unexpected challenges by trimming our businesses through accelerating and initiating further cost reduction initiatives across all our businesses, cancelling sailings and laying up vessels in our shipping businesses, reducing our oil exploration activities as well as reviewing, postponing and cancelling investments across our businesses. We further strengthened our focus on delivering value to our customers and ensuring our fair share of activities.
With six out of eight businesses, equal to more than 93% of the Group's invested capital, delivering top quartile performance in their industries end of Q2 2015, we have executed on our strategy, and we will continue to do so, even in difficult times. Our global network of businesses, strong global brand, highly skilled workf orce and strong balance sheet, gives us an excellent platform to benefit from the current downturn and thereby augment our winning position in the ind ustries in which we compete. We continue to pursue value creating investment opportunities within and adjacent

to our present industries, however only when we believe that we can create sufficient value.
In 2015, global economic conditions remained unpredictable and our businesses and long-term assets were significantly impacted by large short-term volatility. Predicting the value and future income streams from our assets in such volatile times remains uncertain, but on the basis of our current market position and historical performance we continue to believe in our ability to outperform competition in our businesses and we remain confident in our aspiration to be a premium conglomerate.
The Group delivered a profit of USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) and a ROIC of 2.9% (11.0%) in 2015, negatively impacted by post tax impairments of USD 2.6bn on oil assets due to the low oil price expectations as well as the revenue impact from the lower oil price and lower average container freight rates. The impairments of USD 80m in Q2 and USD 2.5bn in Q4 were primarily related to production assets with short lifetime such as Kazakhstan, Kurdistan and the UK as well as our deepwater development assets in Angola and Brazil, where the current conditions do not allow for viable projects. While we have fully impaired the assets and significantly reduced our on-site activities in Angola and Brazil, we continue our efforts to seek solutions in Angola through concept changes and negotiations with authorities, partners and contractors, and in Brazil we are pursuing extensions of the Wahoo and Itaipu licences which expired in Q4 2015.
The underlying profit of USD 3.1bn was within our expectations of around USD 3.4bn. Compared to last year, profits were lower in Maersk Line, Maersk Oil and APM Terminals and higher in Maersk Drilling and APM Shipping Services.
The Group's cash flow from operating activities remained at a high level of USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn) and net cash flow used for capital expenditure came at USD 6.3bn (USD 6.2bn), excluding the sale of shares in Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn.

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015

Contents

With an equity ratio of 57.3% (61.3%) and a liquidity reserve of USD 12.4bn (USD 11.6bn), the Group maintains its strong financial position.
Maersk Line made a profit of USD 1.3bn (USD 2.3bn) and a ROIC of 6.5% (11.6%). The underlying profit declined to USD 1.3bn (USD 2.2bn) due to poor market conditions leading to significantly lower freight rates, in particular in the second half of the year, only partially offset by lower bunker prices, USD appreciation and cost efficiencies.
Maersk Oil made a loss of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD 861m) and a ROIC of negative 38.6% (negative 15.2%). The result was negatively affected by impairments after tax of USD 2.6bn due to the low oil price expectations. The underlying profit was USD 435m (USD 1.0bn) negatively impacted by lower average oil

prices but positively impacted by a higher average entitlement production and lower operating and exploration costs.
APM Terminals made a profit of USD 654m (USD 900m) and a ROIC of 10.9% (14.7%). The underlying profit declined to USD 626m (USD 849m) due to lower volumes particularly in West Africa, Russia and Brazil only partly offset by revenue improvement and cost saving initiatives. APM Terminals accelerated their global growth ambition with several significant acquisitions and new projects.
Maersk Drilling made a profit of USD 751m (USD 478m) and an underlying profit of USD 732m (USD 471m) positively impacted by good contract coverage, fleet growth, cost savings and strong operational performance. Furthermore, the result benefitted from fewer yard stays and additional gain from the

sale of the Venezuela business partly offset by increased idle time and Maersk Endurer being decommissioned and recycled. ROIC was 9.3% (7.1%).
APM Shipping Services made a profit of USD 446m (loss of USD 230m) and a ROIC of 9.5% (negative 4.2%). The underlying profit increased to USD 404m (USD 185m). Maersk Tankers made an underlying profit of USD 156m (USD 139m), Maersk Supply Service saw a decreasing underlying profit of USD 117m (USD 189m), Svitzer improved underlying profit to USD 116m (USD 82m) and Damco improved from an underlying loss of USD 225m in 2014 to an underlying profit of USD 15m in 2015.
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Maersk Line placed three newbuilding orders for a total of 27 vessels with a total capacity of 367,000 TEU. Further investments have been postponed due to the weak market conditions.

The Maersk Oil operated Culzean gas field was sanctioned by the UK government in Q3 with a total field development capex programme of around USD 4.5bn. Maersk Oil is expected to contribute with USD 2.3bn of this. First gas from Culzean is expected in 2019.
Maersk Oil agreed to acquire half of Africa Oil Corporation's ownership in three onshore exploration licences in Kenya and two in Ethiopia. The licences include nine recent oil discoveries with ongoing exploration and appraisal activities. The acquisition price is split between an upfront payment of USD 365m including committed exploration costs and future contingent payments of up to USD 480m for the Lokichar Project depending on the resource volume after final appraisal and the timing for first oil. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2016.
APM Terminals agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in Grup Marítim TCB (TCB), the leading Spanish container terminal operator, with terminals located in Spain, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala and Turkey. APM Terminals' global terminal network will grow from 63 to 74 terminals in 37 countries across five continents and with additional seven terminals under implementation. The 11 acquired TCB terminals add an additional 4.3m TEU in capacity and 3.5m TEU in estimated annual container volumes (2.6m TEU throughput when weighted with APM Terminals' ownership interest in the individual terminals). The acquisition has an implied enterprise value of USD 1.1bn with additional capex investments of USD 400m over the next five years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed in Q1 2016.
APM Terminals agreed to invest around USD 800m in a newbuilt container terminal and connected road infrastructure next to its present facility in Tema, Ghana, with 3.5m TEU annual throughput capacity. During 2015, APM Terminals also agreed to invest in a greenfield grain terminal in Qingdao,

China and acquired a terminal in Cartagena, Colombia as well as a reefer terminal in Vado, Italy. Additionally, APM Terminals upgraded and expanded a number of its terminals globally.
Maersk Drilling took delivery of one drillship, Maersk Voyager, and one ultra harsh environment jack-up rig, Maersk Integrator. Maersk Drilling has one ultra harsh jack-up rig under construction to be delivered in 2016. Maersk Drilling signed seven new contracts during 2015, among which the drillship Maersk Voyager secured a long-term contract of 3.5 years offshore Ghana, Maersk Resilient secured a three-year contract and Mærsk Giant received a contract for 150 days, both for work in the Danish sector of the North Sea. Furthermore, Maersk Drilling signed five contract extensions, including a five-year extension for Heydar Aliyev working in the Caspian Sea, and a three-year extension for Maersk Discoverer working offshore Egypt. Although at significantly lower day rates compared to previous contracts, the new contracts and extensions added USD 2.0bn to Maersk Drilling's revenue backlog and 8,700 contracted rig days.
As part of the fleet renewal, Maersk Tankers signed a newbuilding contract for nine MR vessels with a contract value of approximately USD 300m. The order book totals 17 MR newbuildings to be added to the fleet over the next three years. With the re-delivery of three VLCCs in 2015, Maersk Tankers has two chartered VLCC vessels left in the fleet.

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015
GUIDANCE FOR 2016
The Maersk Group expects an underlying result significantly below last year (USD 3.1bn). Gross cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be around USD 7bn in 2016 (USD 7.1bn).

Contents

Maersk Line expects an underlying result significantly below last year (USD 1.3bn) as a consequence of the significantly lower freight rates going into 2016 and the continued low growth with expected global demand for seaborne container transportation to increase by 1-3%.
Maersk Oil expects a negative underlying result (profit of USD 435m). Breakeven is reached with oil prices in the range USD 45-55 per barrel.

SENSITIVITY GUIDANCE The Group's guidance for 2016 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global economy, the container freight rates and the oil price.
The Group's expected underlying result depends on a number of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other things being equal, the sensitivities for the calendar year 2016 for four key value drivers are listed in the table below:

Maersk Oil's entitlement production is expected to be around 315,000 boepd (312,000 boepd). Exploration costs are expected to be in line with 2015 (USD 423m).
APM Terminals expects an underlying result around the 2015 level (USD 626m).
Maersk Drilling expects an underlying result significantly below last year (USD 732m) mainly due to lower dayrates and more idle days.

Factors Oil price for Maersk Oil Bunker price Container freight rate Container freight volume

Change +/-10 USD/barrel +/-100 USD/tonne +/-100 USD/FFE
+/-100,000 FFE

Effect on the Group's underlying profit +/-USD 0.35bn -/+USD 0.3bn
+/-USD 1.0bn
+/-USD 0.1bn

APM Shipping Services expects the underlying result to be significantly below the 2015 result (USD 404m) predominantly due to significantly lower rates and activity in Maersk Supply Service.

Forward-looking statements The Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various factors, many of which are beyond A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' control, may cause actual development and results to differ materially from expectations contained in the Annual Report.

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015
THE GROUP STRATEGY
Maersk Group is executing on the strategy to be a premium conglomerate with six of our eight businesses, representing more than 93% of the Group's invested capital, being top quartile performers in their industries.

Contents

We have focused the Group's portfolio by divesting non-core assets, and we continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined methodology for allocating capital to our businesses.
We will continue to build a premium conglomerate through active portfolio and performance management, disciplined capital allocation and a clear financial strategy. The Group's financial ambition is to develop its businesses and achieve above 10% ROIC over the cycle.
OUR SUCCESS FACTORS As a group, our business success is built on a number of strengths: our size and global reach, our financial flexibility, our talented employees, our time-honoured values, our commitment to safety and sustainability and our drive to innovate.

Evaluation parameters include industry attractiveness, financial return forecasts, business performance and overall strategic aspirations. The resulting plan provides the framework for each business unit. Portfolio adjustments are integrated into the plan.
The outcome of the Board of Directors' annual strategy conference will, as in previous years, be communicated in connection with the Group's Interim Report for Q2 2016. The outcome will be available for download from: http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm
Between each strategy session, Management and the Board evaluate the development compared to expectations, and these evaluations give rise to short-term tactical adjustments of our investment plans and key focus areas.

We use our global network, skilled people and financial flexibility to enable customers and countries to create wealth and fulfil their economic potential. Our existing strong position in growth markets will remain a focus area going forward, as the Group is in a good position to profit from growth when it returns.
THE GROUP STRATEGY PROCESS The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to ensure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed according to market developments. The integrated Group strategy review, portfolio actions and capital prioritisation process starts at the beginning of the year. The Board of Directors have their annual strategy conference in June at which the Board discusses proposals put forward by the Executive Board and decides on the strategy.
Strategies, including detailed plans and opportunities for the coming years, are developed for each business. The total capital requirement across businesses is prioritised with a view to optimise the portfolio of the Group in line with financial policies.

STRATEGY UPDATE The low global economic growth with resulting low container freight rates and oil price has fundamentally changed the shortterm outlook of almost all of our businesses. As a consequence, we updated our business unit strategies during 2015 to provide more flexibility on the short-term financial targets as we maintain our key focus on competitiveness and our customers.
The changed market conditions unfortunately also necessitated a change to the Group's priorities for 2015, as all business units were required to accelerate on cost and efficiency programmes in order to improve profitability and remain ahead of competitors, while at the same time revising the targets for short-term organic growth.
In October, we downgraded our expectations for Maersk Line's and the Group's results for 2015, and consequently Maersk Line adjusted the plans for short-term growth by postponing further investments beyond our firm commitments to ship yards.

The competitiveness of our businesses instills confidence in our ability to weather the storm and we will continue to work on further strengthening our strong foothold in our industries.
Difficult times also present opportunities and given our strong financial position, we are making focused investments to pursue growth.
In order to maintain and grow our businesses and thereby achieve our ambition of a ROIC above 10% over the cycle, we have to accept that in a low interest environment we have to also opt for investments that at present do not on a standalone basis fully comply with our 10% ROIC target.
Net interest-bearing debt is managed in line with the Maersk Group's current Baa1/BBB+ credit rating. The Group generally intends to centralise funding at parent company level and to raise funds from diversified sources, including bonds.
Focusing the Group's portfolio After the sale of our shares in Danske Bank, the Group's remaining businesses are all related to shipping or energy markets. The proceeds from the sale were returned to shareholders as an extraordinary dividend.
We maintain our focus on active portfolio and performance management and we have created a strong platform for future investment, growth and innovation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group's profit for the year was USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) and the equity totalled USD 35.7bn (USD 42.2bn).
The review of the financial statement is carried out through the presentation of the Group's businesses.

Contents

INCOME STATEMENT Revenue decreased to USD 40.3bn (USD 47.6bn), predominantly due to lower oil price and lower average container freight rates only partly compensated by higher entitlement production. The operating expenses decreased by USD 4.4bn mainly due to lower bunker prices and cost saving initiatives.
Profit decreased by USD 4.3bn to USD 925m (USD 5.2bn). The profit for 2015 was primarily impacted by the net impairments after tax of USD 2.6bn on oil assets due to the low oil price expectations as well as the revenue impact from the lower oil price and lower average container freight rates.
The profit in 2014 was positively impacted by a USD 2.8bn gain from the sale of the majority share of Dansk Supermarked Group and other divestment gains of USD 600m partly offset by net impairments after tax of USD 2.2bn primarily related to the Brazilian oil assets of USD 1.7bn, UK oil assets of USD 188m and goodwill in Svitzer of USD 357m.
Further comments to the profit development are provided per segment below.
MAERSK LINE Maersk Line made a profit of USD 1.3bn (USD 2.3bn) and a ROIC of 6.5% (11.6%). The underlying profit was USD 1.3bn (USD 2.2bn).
Revenue of 23.7bn was 13.2% lower than in 2014 (USD 27.4bn). The development was driven by a 16.0% decline in average freight rates to 2,209 USD/FFE (2,630 USD/FFE) and only partially offset by a 0.8% increase in volumes to 9,522 FFE (9,442 FFE).
The freight rate decline was largely attributable to bunker price savings being passed through to customers and to deteriorating market conditions. Container freight rates declined across all trades except North America, especially in Maersk Line's key

trades to/from Europe and Latin America. Recognised freight revenue was USD 21.3bn (USD 25.0bn) and other revenue was USD 2.4bn (USD 2.4bn).
To minimise the impact of declining freight rates, Maersk Line accelerated further network rationalisations and operating cost reduction programmes. In response to the weakening demand, Maersk Line also reduced capacity by closing down four services and adjusted the network over the course of 2015.
Global container demand is expected to have grown between 0-1% in 2015 compared to 2014 while the global container fleet grew by almost 8%. The low growth is primarily due to weaker imports into Europe as well as slowdown in emerging economies.
The EBIT margin gap to peers is estimated at around 6.6% for the full year (Q4 2014 to Q3 2015) and around 5% for the last quarter (Q3 2015), on par with the 5% ambition level. The EBIT margin gap to peers narrowed considerably compared to 2014 (9%) as a consequence of the sharp decline in bunker prices, as well as Maersk Line's relatively higher exposure to the key Europe trades which was more impacted by the freight rate decline than other trades. Maersk Line responded to the challenging market conditions by accelerating its cost focus, and in November, Maersk Line announced its plans to reduce the organisation by more than 4,000 staff positions by 2017.
Unit cost decreased by 11.5% to 2,288 USD/FFE benefitting from decreased bunker prices and USD appreciation. Bunker cost decreased 42.8% compared to 2014 driven by lower bunker prices. Bunker efficiency deteriorated by 1.0% to 931 kg/FFE (921 kg/FFE). Maersk Line's fleet utilisation was lower than expected in 2015 as reduction initiatives were only taken late in the year to adapt to the weaker than expected market demand.
By the end of 2015, the Maersk Line fleet consisted of 285 owned vessels (1.8m TEU) and 305 chartered vessels (1.1m TEU) with a

13/102

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015

Contents

total capacity of 3.0m TEU, an increase of 0.5% compared to the end of 2014. Idle capacity at the end of 2015 was 32,733 TEU (four vessels) versus 18,138 TEU (three vessels) at the end of 2014. Maersk Line's idle capacity corresponds to around 2% of total idle capacity in the market.
The global container fleet grew by around 8% compared to 2014. At the end of 2015, it stood at 20m TEU of which 7.0% were idle. Deliveries amounted to 1.7m TEU (214 vessels) and 203,000 TEU (107 vessels) were scrapped during 2015. New ordering amounted to 2.3m TEU (254 vessels), keeping the order book close to 20% of the fleet (Alphaliner).
In Q4, Maersk Line entered into an agreement to divest its five Multi Purpose Vessels (MPV). Maersk Line will exit the MPV segment during Q1 2016.
Cash flow from operating activities decreased by USD 848m to USD 3.3bn compared to 2014. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 169m higher at USD 2.1bn primarily related to delivery of five Triple-E vessels and ordering of 27 new vessels during 2015. In spite of challenging market conditions, Maersk Line delivered a positive free cash flow of USD 1.1bn (USD 2.1bn) in 2015.
MAERSK OIL Maersk Oil reported a loss of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD 861m due to Brazilian impairment) and a ROIC of negative 38.6% (negative 15.2%) with an underlying profit of USD 435m (USD 1.0bn).
The result was negatively affected by net impairments after tax of USD 2.6bn due to the low oil price expectations. The impairments were primarily related to production assets with short lifetime such as Kazakhstan, Kurdistan and the UK as well as our deepwater development assets in Angola and Brazil, where the current conditions do not allow for viable projects. While we have fully impaired the assets and significantly reduced our

on-site activities in Angola and Brazil, we continue our efforts to seek solutions in Angola through concept changes and negotiations with authorities, partners and contractors, and in Brazil we are pursuing extensions of the Wahoo and Itaipu licenses which expired in Q4 2015.
The underlying profit of USD 435m was negatively affected by the lower average oil price of USD 52 per barrel versus USD 99 per barrel in 2014. This was partly offset by 24% higher entitle ment production of 312,000 boepd (251,000 boepd), deferred tax income of USD 170m due to reduction of the UK tax rate and 45% lower exploration costs of USD 423m (USD 765m).
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 1.8bn (USD 2.6bn). Cash flow used for capital expenditure of USD 2.0bn was 8.2% lower than 2014 (USD 2.2bn) with the recent sanctioned Johan Sverdrup in Norway, and Culzean in the UK contributing the most.
The increased entitlement production came primarily from the UK increase of 76% where Golden Eagle came on stream in Q4 2014, from Qatar with an increase of 29% where the decreased oil prices give more barrels for cost recovery as well as from Jack in the US coming on stream in Q4 2014 delivering a Maersk Oil entitlement production of 6,000 boepd. The increases were partly offset by the natural field decline in Denmark by 7%.
Maersk Oil reduced operating expenses, excluding exploration costs, by 12% to USD 2.5bn (USD 2.8bn). This is in line with the targeted 20% reduction by the end of 2016 compared to the 2014 baseline. As a consequence, the total number of positions was reduced by approximately 1,250 during 2015.
Maersk Oil completed nine exploration and appraisal wells. The East Swara Tika-1 well in Kurdistan found hydrocarbons in commercial volumes whereas four wells encountered hydrocarbons in sub-commercial volumes and four wells were dry.

The 2012 development project at the Al Shaheen field offshore Qatar is progressing as planned and more than 80% of the drilling programme is now completed.
Recent acquisitions to be completed in 2016 include interest in exploration licences in Kenya and Ethiopia. The Kenyan authorities have approved the transaction whereas Ethiopia is still pending. Shortly after the acquisition, an exploration well encountered oil and commercial viability of the discovery is being assessed.
The yearly update of Maersk Oil's reserves and resources as per end of 2014 showed entitlement reserves and resources (2P+2C) of 1.31bn barrels of oil equivalent (1.47bn) including proved and probable (2P) reserves of 0.50bn barrels of oil equivalent (0.60bn). 2015 reserves and resources numbers will be released in connection with the Interim Report for Q1 2016.
APM TERMINALS APM Terminals made a profit of USD 654m (USD 900m) and a ROIC of 10.9% (14.7%) with an underlying profit of USD 626m (USD 849m). The low oil price resulted in a sharp decline in import volumes into oil producing countries in West Africa, Russia and Brazil. Along with divestments in 2014, this caused revenue to decrease by 4.8% and the EBITDA-margin to decrease by 2.7% compared to last year (22.7%). Operating business generated a profit of USD 696m (USD 931m) while projects under implementation had a loss of USD 42m (loss of USD 31m) stemming from their upstart costs.
The 2014 result was positively impacted by net divestment gains after tax of USD 232m and negatively affected by USD 181m impairments related to European activities of which USD 154m was related to joint venture companies. The result for 2015 does not include any impairment but includes net divestment gains of USD 10m and positive impact from reversed impairments of USD 14m.

Global market conditions have had an unfavourable effect on container volumes and rates in several key terminals. Specifically, key terminals in oil dependent markets have declined significantly compared to 2014. Partly mitigating this, performance in APM Terminals' North American businesses has increased compared to 2014, mainly due to increased volume and storage income.
The number of containers handled by APM Terminals (weighted with APM Terminals' ownership interest) decreased by 6.0% compared to 2014, reaching 36.0m TEU (38.3m TEU). The de crease was mainly due to divestments of terminal facilities in Charleston, Jacksonville and Houston, USA, and Gioia Tauro, Italy, in 2015 as well as APM Terminals, Virginia, USA, and Terminal Porte Océane S.A. Le Havre, France, in 2014. Excluding these divestments, like-for-like volumes decreased by 1.1%, whereas the overall global container market grew by 1.3% (Drewry).
Revenue improvement and cost saving initiatives continue to be driven across the global portfolio and have delivered approximately USD 200m to the bottom line, however the impact from the adverse market conditions was only partly mitigated.
The acquisition of the TCB portfolio will initially have a negative impact on ROIC of just over one percentage point due to the increased asset base and the amortisation of terminal rights. The acquisition has an implied enterprise value of USD 1.1bn with additional capex investments of USD 400m over the next five years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed in Q1 2016.
The share of profit in joint ventures and associated companies increased to USD 199m (USD 79m), mainly caused by the USD 154m impairments in joint venture companies in 2014.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 874m (USD 925m). Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 774m (positive USD 2m).

MAERSK DRILLING Maersk Drilling delivered a profit of USD 751m (USD 478m) generating a ROIC of 9.3% (7.1%), positively impacted by good contract coverage, fleet growth, cost savings and strong operational performance. The result was also positively impacted by fewer yard stays and further a gain from the sale of the Venezuela business partly offset by increased idle time and Maersk Endurer (built 1984) being decommissioned and recycled in July 2015. The underlying profit was USD 732m (USD 471m).
The economic utilisation of the fleet was 85% (90%) adversely affected by increased idle time. The average operational uptime was 98% (97%) for the jack-up rigs and 94% (96%) for the floating rigs. Maersk Drilling's safety performance saw a further improvement in the LTI frequency from 0.57 to 0.31 during the year as a result of a relentless drive towards an incident free workplace.
Although at significantly lower day rates compared to previous contracts, the new contracts and extensions signed in 2015 added 8,700 rig days and USD 2.0bn to Maersk Drilling's revenue backlog. At the end of 2015, Maersk Drilling's forward contract coverage was 77% for 2016, 52% for 2017 and 43% for 2018. The total revenue backlog by the end of the year amounted to USD 5.4bn (USD 6.0bn).
While significant uncertainty remains in the medium to longterm outlook for offshore drilling services and particularly the deepwater market, Maersk Drilling maintains a competitive advantage due to its comparatively young rig fleet, although the short-term profitability will continue to be under pressure.
The semi-submersible rig Mærsk Deliverer finalised yard stay as planned and was back on operating rate mid-September 2015.
Operating costs increased due to four new rigs entering the fleet and starting operation during the last six quarters partly offset by the divestment of the Venezuela business in Q3 2014.

The initiated cost reduction and efficiency enhancement programme delivered a saving of more than 8% in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding positive effect from exchange rates.
The increased cash flow from operating activities of USD 1.3bn (USD 701m) was mainly related to three additional rigs in operation and cost savings. Cash flow used for capital expenditure declined to USD 854m (USD 2.2bn), mainly due to fewer instalments paid for the newbuild projects.
APM SHIPPING SERVICES APM Shipping Services made a profit of USD 446m (loss of USD 230m) and a ROIC of 9.5% (negative 4.2%). The under lying profit was USD 404m (USD 185m).
Maersk Tankers made a profit of USD 160m (USD 132m) and a ROIC of 9.9% (6.8%). The underlying profit was USD 156m (USD 139m). The result was positively affected by improved rates and cost saving initiatives.
Average Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) earnings in the product segments increased by 29% compared to 2014 due to higher demand in the market for transportation of refined oil products.
Operating cost decreased mainly as a result of cost saving ini tiatives contributing positively by USD 16m, the divestment of the VLCC vessels, re-delivery of long-term chartered tonnage and lower bunker fuel costs.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 291m (USD 232m). Net cash flow from capital expenditure was USD 185m (positive USD 650m), primarily driven by the acquisition of nine Product tankers and newbuilding instalments, partly offset by the sale of eight Product tankers and two VLCC vessels.
During 2015, Maersk Tankers took delivery of two MR newbuildings and placed an order for nine more vessels. The order

book totals 17 vessels, of which seven will be delivered during 2016, and the last ten in the following two years.
Maersk Supply Service reported a profit of USD 147m (USD 201m) and a ROIC of 8.5% (11.9%). The underlying profit was USD 117m (USD 189m).
Revenue for the year decreased to USD 613m (USD 778m) following lower rates and lower utilisation as well as fewer vessel days available due to divestments and lay-ups. The decreased revenue was partly mitigated by significant cost reductions with total operating costs at USD 345m (USD 430m).
The continued market decline in the offshore industry led to a number of vessel lay-ups globally, including Maersk Supply Service with nine vessels laid up at the end of the year. As a consequence, Maersk Supply Service announced during the year the need to adjust the crew pool by more than 300 offshore positions and a 15% reduction in headquarter positions.
Contract coverage going into 2016 was 42% (50% for 2015) and 16% (29% for 2016) for 2017.
Cash flow from operating activities decreased to USD 250m (USD 356m) primarily caused by a lower operational result. Cash flow used for capital expenditure increased to USD 206m (USD 188m) mainly due to investment in a second hand vessel.

acquisition in Australia. Disregarding goodwill impact, 2015 saw a positive development compared to 2014 due to successfully implemented cost and productivity initiatives.
Revenue decreased by USD 143m as a result of a substantially stronger USD compared to AUD and EUR, as well as salvage revenue being excluded after the activities were merged with Titan Salvage, USA (USD 80m). These effects were partly offset by higher activity in harbour towage and Svitzer's entry into Brazil.

business. Airfreight volumes fell by 4% over 2015, but grew through the second half of the year. Supply chain management volumes continued to show improvements and ended 5% above 2014.
Over the past two years, Damco has been through a transformation phase and is now starting to see the planned benefits. Costs have been reduced and productivity has increased with improved bottom-line profitability and cash generation as outcome, bringing Damco to a profitable result for 2015.

The industry experienced significant overcapacity and slowdown in most shipping segments, not least bulk trades, but Svitzer managed to increase its market share in competitive ports in both Australia and Europe.

Cash flow from operating activities was positive USD 127m (negative USD 201m) due to the improved operational result and reduced working capital through stricter cash management.

Underlying profitability improved through pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, which resulted in an EBITDA margin of 28.4% (20.9%).
Cash flow from operating activities decreased to USD 138m (USD 203m) driven by salvage activities. Cash flow from investing activities decreased by USD 83m to USD 152m.
Damco made a profit of USD 19m (loss of USD 293m) and a ROIC of 7.1% (negative 63.2%). The underlying profit was USD 15m (loss of USD 225m).

OTHER BUSINESSES Other businesses made a profit of USD 316m (USD 408m). The result for 2015 includes primarily the gain from the sale of shares in Danske Bank of USD 223m and the sale of Esvagt of USD 76m, while 2014 primarily included the Group's share of profit in Danske Bank of USD 330m.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations included Dansk Supermarked Group in 2014, while nothing was included as discontinued operations in 2015.

During the year Maersk Supply Service took delivery of a new Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessel (AHTS), acquired one second hand Subsea Support vessel and sold five AHTS. Total order book stands at 11 vessels.
Svitzer delivered a profit of USD 120m (loss of USD 270m) and a ROIC of 10.9% (negative 19.2%). The underlying profit was USD 116m (USD 82m). The 2014 result was impacted by goodwill impairment of USD 357m primarily related to the 2007 Adsteam

Productivity improvements, overhead cost reductions and growth in supply chain management activities were the primary drivers behind the improved result.
Revenue was USD 2.7bn (USD 3.2bn), with the reduction largely caused by rate of exchange movements. Margins in both ocean and airfreight segments saw improvements, whereas ocean freight volumes declined over the whole of 2015 and ended 9% below 2014, partly due to de-selection of less-profitable

UNALLOCATED ACTIVITIES Unallocated activities comprise activities which are not attributable to reportable segments, including financial items as well as centralised purchasing and resale of bunker and lubricating oil to companies in the Group. Financial items were negative by USD 423m (negative by USD 606m); the positive development was primarily driven by value adjustment on Danske Bank shares, lower interest expenses due to lower debt and interest rates as well as currency adjustments.

TA X Companies in the Group are taxed under different tax regimes, depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to some of the Group's activities.
Generally, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage based or similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the fleet's tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.
In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the normal corporate tax rate.
The total tax charge for the Group in 2015 was USD 0.5bn (USD 3.0bn) of which taxes payable to Denmark were USD 0.2bn (USD 0.8bn). The amounts related to the special hydrocarbon tax were USD 0.1bn (USD 0.5bn) and USD 0.1bn (USD 0.3bn) represented corporate tax on oil activities. The decrease in the special hydrocarbon tax was largely due to the drop in oil prices. The shipping activities' tax payment to Denmark was USD 12m (USD 13m).
TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Total comprehensive income for the year was USD 540m (USD 3.6bn) and includes the profit for the year of USD 925m (USD 5.2bn) and other comprehensive income, which was negative by USD 385m (negative by USD 1.6bn). Other comprehensive income mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow hedges and actuarial gains and losses.
BALANCE SHEET At 31 December 2015, total assets amounted to USD 62.4bn (USD 68.8bn).

Property, plant and equipment of USD 44.0bn (USD 44.7bn) decreased by USD 672m. Investments in the year amounted to USD 7.3bn (USD 8.9bn). Depreciation for the year was USD 4.6bn (USD 4.2bn) and net impairment losses of USD 2.1bn (loss of USD 421m) were recognised. Sale of property, plant and equipment amounted to USD 773m (USD 512m) including the assets held for sale. Currency adjustments resulted in a decrease of USD 435m (decrease of USD 399m).
For further description of significant accounting estimates and judgements see note 25.
Derivatives were as of 31 December 2015 a net liability of USD 837m (net liability of USD 500m). The movement was primarily related to the USD appreciating against main hedging currencies.
Cash and bank balances totalled USD 4.0bn (USD 3.5bn) at 31 December 2015, including offsetting bank overdrafts of USD 12m (USD 102m).
Equity totalled USD 35.7bn (USD 42.2bn). The decrease was related to the extraordinary dividend related to the sale of the Danske Bank shares of USD 5.2bn, the share buy-back of USD 780m, ordinary dividend paid of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.3bn) and other comprehensive income is negative of USD 385m. The reduction was partly offset by the profit for the year of USD 925m.
The actuarial net liability for pensions, etc. in relation to defined benefit plans recognised totalled USD 131m (USD 217m) at 31 December 2015. Developments in the actuarial assumptions as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements res ulted in actuarial gains of USD 68m (loss of USD 9m), which are included in other comprehensive income. In 2015, the Group paid USD 116m (USD 81m) to defined benefit plans.
Deferred tax liabilities totalled USD 280m (USD 701m) at 31 December 2015, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled USD

891m (USD 536m). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of USD 1.9bn (USD 1.5bn) have not been recognised, cf. note 9 in the consolidated financial statements.
Net interest-bearing debt remained at the same level as at the end of 2014 positively impacted by free cash flows of USD 6.6bn offset by ordinary dividend of USD 1.0bn, extraordinary dividend of USD 5.2bn and share buy-back of USD 780m. In 2015, the Group issued bonds for USD 1.0bn in the US market and EUR 600m in the euro market. USD 1.8bn of revolving credit facilities were signed in 2015 while USD 687m of undrawn financing commitments were either cancelled or expired during 2015 due to the Group's strong liquidity position.
CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities USD 8.0bn (USD 8.8bn) was negatively impacted by the lower result which was partly offset by decreased tax payments of USD 1.8bn and improved working capital as well as lower interest payments.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 1.4bn (USD 6.2bn). The decrease was mainly due to the sale of Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn.
OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS The present value of the operating lease commitments totalled USD 7.0bn at 31 December 2015 (USD 7.7bn at 31 December 2014) using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into the following main items: ·Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of USD 3.3bn (USD 3.8bn)
primarily relating to vessels on time charter ·APM Terminals of USD 2.9bn (USD 3.1bn) primarily related
to future concession fees for port facilities · Other commitments of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.8bn).
About one third of the time charter payments in Maersk Line and in Maersk Tankers is estimated to relate to operational

costs for the assets, cf. note 19 in the consolidated financial statements.
CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements of the Maersk Group are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. Møller Holding A/S.
PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS After transferring the global container services in Maersk Line into Maersk Line A/S in 2015, the activities of the parent company comprise the oil and gas activities in the Danish sector of the North Sea and parts of offshore and other shipping activities. In addition, activities include the holding of shares in subsidi aries and associated companies as well as funding, procurement and cash management.
In the parent company financial statements, shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised at cost, cf. note 21, less impairment losses, and in the income statement, dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income.
Profit for the year was USD 2.4bn (USD 8.0bn), primarily impacted by impairments of USD 310m and lower result of the oil and gas activities as well as lower sales gains.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 0.7bn (USD 0.6bn). Total assets amounted to USD 48.6bn (USD 54.2bn) and equity totalled USD 22.6bn (USD 27.2bn) at 31 December 2015.

RISK MANAGEMENT
An established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is embedded in the Group. This enables and supports a consistent, robust and focused approach to assessing the three main categories comprising the Group's risk universe, namely the Known Risks, the Emerging Risks and the Portfolio Risks. The three categories are explored through a combination of risk reporting, internal analyses and external expert input. The main findings are reviewed by the Executive Board as well as the Board of Directors, and serve as input to the annual strategy and capital allocation processes. The Audit Committee annually reviews the process for adequacy and potential improvements.

KNOWN RISKS Known Risks are considered actual risks to business objectives within the planning period 2016-2021. While some risks are integral in the industries we operate in and therefore are accepted and managed as part of our operations, several risks continue to have the potential of adversely impacting our business in the short to medium term, such as:
A sharp and prolonged drop in oil prices continues to constitute a key risk, as we are increasingly targeting technologically demanding and costly industry segments. The declined and persistently subdued oil price observed since end 2014 has led to reduced cash flows and revised forecasts from our oil and oil related businesses. The market developments and the duration of the downturn exert pressure on securing commercially viable contracts for Maersk Drilling, Maersk Supply Service and the oil production pipeline in Maersk Oil. Ultimately this could, in the long run, impact our ability to meet our financial targets or moreover our investment and growth ambitions. Conversely, the current environment, coupled with the Group's financial strength, could also present investment opportunities within oil and oil related businesses. The Group is seeking to mitigate this risk by continuing to be top quartile performer through cost reduction programmes as well as by renegotiating terms with authorities, partners and contractors to make projects more attractive.
A major accident or oil spill remains an inherent risk in the Group's operations, particularly in the oil and gas, offshore and tanker businesses. A high severity incident would first and foremost present a risk to our employees as well as potentially to the marine environment, wildlife and local communities. Additionally it could result in large scale impact on assets, liquidity position and reputation and put our license to operate at risk. The Group is proactively building and supporting incident free operations to mitigate this risk.

A major cyber-attack could prove detrimental to our ability to operate and deliver on our commitments, as the Group is involved in complex and wide ranging global services, making it highly dependent on well-functioning IT systems. Business disruptions could be as severe as lasting several months, impacting our fleet's and offshore equipments' ability to safely continue operations. The Group is monitoring this threat closely and proactively addresses it through enhancements of our cyber resilience and focus on business continuity management in the event that IT systems are affected.
A larger than expected downturn in the container market underscores the severity of the threat that a potential widening of the container liner business supply-demand imbalance could be in an environment characterised by low global demand growth. A structural gap and overcapacity, coupled with the significant exposure that Maersk Line has to the Asia-Europe trade where the larger vessels are increasingly deployed, leave the Group vulnerable to substantial fluctuations in freight rates and the risk of sustaining commercial losses. The Group is mitigating this risk by designing a competitive network, being a cost leader in the industry, continuing to simplify the organisation and optimising the network utilisation through alliances and vessel sharing agreements.
The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to ensure a regular assessment of the Group's strategy in accordance with market dynamics, including developments in the oil price and the fundamentals of the container freight markets.
EMERGING RISKS Emerging Risks are potential future threats, looking over a time horizon beyond that of the planning period. Most of our industries are capital intensive and investments often have long return periods. As a consequence, we need to proactively consider future uncertainties that may affect our earnings. This is done through a comprehensive process aimed at identifying

emerging trends with the potential of posing long-term risks. Some of the identified Emerging Risks are addressed through deep dive studies. These studies facilitate a better understanding of the key drivers, components and underlying dynamics of the trend and the associated risks and opportunities. In selecting the risks for further analysis, emphasis is put on their assessed severity in terms of likelihood and impact, as well as the velocity with which they may be approaching. Additionally, the potential for action ability and support of informed decision-making stemming from the gained insights are considered to optimise the use and focus of the Group's efforts and resources in undertaking such studies.
In 2014, large vessel disasters surfaced as a potential signifi cant risk. Driven by rapid technological expansion in vessel capacity and capability, the risk picture was considered relevant for further analysis. Therefore, a deep dive study was conducted to unveil the nature of the risk when considering the tail risk scenarios, the triggers, the potential impacts as well as existing key mitigations and possible future remedies to further limit the exposure. Worst case scenarios and incidents considered in the study were, among others, a vessel colliding with an offshore installation or a total wreck removal. Technical, operational and process related perspectives were covered during the analysis. The study was a wide collaboration within the Group and has allowed for a deeper understanding of the risks accompanying the inevitable technological progress. The findings underscored the necessity of the already increased focus and constant care, which the Group applies to the safety of our seafarers and assets, as well as attention to all aspects, including potential new risks, stemming from pursuing technological excellence.
Looking ahead, the Group continues to monitor developments with the potential of impacting our business. Examples of such dynamics surfacing as Emerging Risks in 2015 are the prospects of shifts in trade flows from reshoring/nearshoring,

developm ents in the digital economy and its long-term effect on shipping, as well as the projections of shale oil/gas reservoirs development expansion outside North America and the resulting impact on the global supply of hydrocarbons.
PORTFOLIO RISKS Being a global conglomerate spanning multiple geographies and industries, the Group also considers risks associated with its composition of businesses and countries of operation. This means that when managing our portfolio, both dimensions are assessed, i.e. the balances in our industry exposure and our geographical presence. A depiction of the correlation between our businesses, see the graph "Impact of diversification", suggests

that managing them as a portfolio in a conglomerate, as opposed to standalone business areas, reduces the associated risks. It also implies a well-diversified portfolio of businesses capable of absorbing shocks inflicting volatility within single businesses, evidenced by the Group's combined NOPAT vola tility being 31% lower than the aggregated volatility of the four main individual businesses (those comprising solely one industry). This combined volatility broadly remains unaffected by recent portfolio concentration. From a geographic risk point of view, the portfolio on average remains in the relatively low risk category. The Group's agreed investments may modestly increase this exposure, but it will overall remain well-balanced by substantial investments in a number of low risk countries.

OWN SHARES The DKK 5.6bn share buy-back program initiated on 1 September 2014 was concluded on 27 February 2015. The Board of Directors decided to initiate a new share buy-back program of up to DKK 6.7bn (approximately USD 1bn) to be executed during a 12 months period beginning 1 September 2015. The purpose of the share buyback program is to adjust the capital structure of the company. At the company's annual general meeting in 2016, a resolution will be proposed that shares acquired be cancelled. The Groups holding of own shares comprised 2.0% of the share capital end of 2015, cf. note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
DIVIDEND Dividend is the Group's primary distribution of capital to our shareholders. The nominal dividend has increased steadily over the last decade. The Group's objective is to increase the nominal dividend per share over time; supported by under lying earnings growth.

The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend to the shareholders of DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000). The proposed dividend payment represents an ordinary dividend yield of 3.3% (2.4%), based on the Maersk B share's closing price as of 30 December 2015. Payment is expected to take place on 15th April 2016.

The Group paid an extraordinary dividend of DKK 1,671 per share equal to the value of the Group's Danske Bank shares in 2015.

OUR EMPLOYEES
During 2015, the Group introduced a new job levelling structure, which applies across all business units. MyCareer means that all parts of the Group have a single, consistent approach to both job grading and career principles. It creates transparency and visibility of different job opportunities and is a platform for career development.

Contents

In 2015, we saw continued actions and progress towards our diversity goals. More information on diversity can be obtained from the Group's Sustainability Report.
The business units each have their key priorities and focus areas to support their respective strategies; below are some examples.
Maersk Line is progressing with the transformation to reduce transactional work through standardisation and digitisation of key processes. This transformation will result in a leaner, more agile and more focused organisation.
At the same time, Maersk Line continues to invest in developing our employees' world-class leadership capabilities by bringing Maersk Line leaders together to align on strategic direction and vision and to accelerate personal development and help our leaders to become more effective in driving the Maersk Line strategy.
Maersk Oil is operating in a materially changed oil price environment, which has led to necessary decisions to reduce activity levels through 2015. This has resulted in a reduction of positions by 1,250, affecting both employees and contractors. The business remains focused on long-term growth opportunities, and the staff reductions were done in a manner ensuring that we safeguarded Maersk Oil's technical strengths and its good demographic profile compared to industry peers.

APM Terminals continue its drive towards safe operations across the business and achieved a substantial reduction in high severity accidents, via the "Fatal 5" campaign focussing on the five highest risk areas in terminal activities. APM Terminals unfortunately suffered four fatal accidents in 2015.
For Maersk Drilling, all crews on the newbuildings delivered in 2014 and 2015 were hired well in advance, up to six months prior to operation start, in order to participate in top class training and performance enhancement, establish good teamwork and ensure a safe and efficient operation of the new fleet.
Maersk Drilling aims to remain at the forefront of innovation in safety, environment and operational efficiency within the offshore oil and gas industry. The training conducted for all new employees in Maersk Drilling has so far been very successful, which is also why Maersk Drilling today has one of the best safety and operational performance track records in the industry. At the same time, ongoing competence building is taking place for onshore staff, in technical, operational and support functions, to enhance the overall performance in Maersk Drilling and safeguard the internal talent pipeline for the future.

The local content programmes in strategically important countries like Qatar, Kazakhstan and Angola, continue to drive development of the local workforce, and in May 2015 Maersk Oil Qatar won the award for the 'Overall Best Support to Qatarization' at the annual Qatarization Review Meeting of the Energy and Industry Sector.

INNOVATION
Maersk Maritime Technology successfully manages a signific ant portion of the business units' innovation. Furthermore, the Group Inno vation Board aims to identify and fund projects, which are not directly related to the business units' daily operat ions. Here are examples from the Group's business units.

Maersk Line finalised the roll out of its Remote Container Management (RCM) solution. Over 250,000 reefer containers have now been equipped with a dedicated GPS unit, 3G high temperature SIM card and two GSM antennas and terminals have been trained in the new RCM processes. With near-real time visibility into the conditions of each reefer container at almost any part of the journey, RCM will optimise the operational processes leading to improved tracking and control of high value reefer cargo.
Maersk Line also further invested in its data analytics and digital capabilities. This will enable Maersk Line to optimise and modernise its processes and improve the usage of the vast amount of data generated. Maersk Line continues to invest in improving the quality and transparency of operational vessel data. Improved fuel efficiency, voyage planning and operational efficiency continue to be an important innovation focus area.
During 2015, Maersk Line continued its retrofit programme to upgrade its fleet with the latest energy efficiency technologies. Based on a technology screening, each vessel (class) is retrofitted with a tailored package of technology improvements. Maersk Line is working together with key partners to prepare for upcoming regulations such as ballast water and air emission abatement technologies. Maersk Line is also working with the industry and regulators to find technologies to ensure effective enforcement of recent sulphur regulations. Effective enforcement of current and future sulphur regulations is an important prerequisite to ensure a level playing field in the maritime industry.
Maersk Oil is seeking to enhance business competitiveness by developing further knowledge at extracting hydrocarbons from complex reservoirs such as tight chalk reservoirs in the North Sea and high-pressure, high-temperature fields like the Culzean field. An example of this effort is Maersk Oil's and the other Danish Underground Consortium partners' investment in the Danish Hydrocarbon Research & Technology Centre, launched in September 2014, where the first major technology programme has been initiated encompassing advanced water

flooding of the Dan, Halfdan and Kraka fields. Other focus areas are enhanced reservoir modelling, enhanced oil recovery mechanisms and cost-effective well completions.
In addition, Maersk Oil is protecting own developed technology with patent applications for new inventions, which in 2015 has resulted in patent applications for new methods for improved data and signal transmission in wells.
APM Terminals' new Maasvlakte II facility is the world's first fully-automated and emissions-free, sustainably-powered container terminal. The facility has in 2015 transitioned from its testing phase into operation, and despite start-up challenges, the volume ramp-up continues.
Many of the systems and technologies applied in Maasvlakte II will also be utilised at APM Terminals' project at Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico. The terminal is expected to open late 2016, and will be the first automated container terminal in Latin America and will feature fully automated electric yard stacking cranes, and shuttle carriers will be used for transport between the yard cranes and ship to shore cranes.
Maersk Drilling is currently planning a test of Big Data analytic tools for two applications: drilling productivity in order to increase drilling efficiency as well as maintenance improvement in order to reduce cost and to increase reliability. This will support Maersk Drilling's drive to reduce the overall maintenance cost, including five-year survey cost, while maintaining uptime and reliability. The tests are planned to be completed in 2016 and will form the basis for an overall Big Data strategy in Maersk Drilling.
Maersk Drilling has designed the next generation drillship. Together with key industry equipment and technology providers the technical specification of the 20KTM drillship has been final ised. The 20KTM rigs will be able to safely and efficiently operate in high-pressure, high-temperature reservoirs up to 20,000 pounds per square inch and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. It will however require higher oil prices before the new drillship can be realised commercially.

APM Terminals and Maersk Line have entered into a commercial agreement whereby Maersk Line is secured dedicated capacity in certain strategically important terminals. Under the terms of the agreement, substantially all of the risks and benefits associated with ownership of these terminals are transferred to Maersk Line.
Management has chosen not to apply finance lease accounting for the internal reporting and accordingly these terminals are still reported as part of APM Terminals in the segment information. The effect for APM Terminals is an increase of USD 90m (USD 97m) in revenue and USD 31m (USD 66m) in EBIT excluding the gains or losses in connection with the de-recognition of non-current assets. Maersk Line is affected by the same amount on cost and EBIT.
The agreement has no effect on the Group as the transactions are eliminated in the consolidation.

Geographical information Revenue for the shipping activities is based on the destination for ships operated by the Group and on customer location for ships on time charter. For non-current assets, which cannot be easily moved (e.g. drilling rigs, oil producing facilities, etc.), geographical location is where the assets are located. For all other assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership. These assets consist mainly of ships and containers registered in China, Denmark, Singapore, United Kingdom and the USA.

Additions of own shares related to the buy-back programmes initiated in September 2014 and 2015. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to adjust the capital structure of the Company. At the Company's Annual General Meetings in 2015 and 2016, a resolution was and will be proposed that shares acquired, which are not used for hedging purposes of the ongoing incentives programmes, will be cancelled.

Disposals of own shares are primarily related to the share option programme.

Based on the parent company's profit of USD 2,366m (USD 7,984m), the Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 ­ a total of DKK 6,464m, equivalent to USD 946m at the exchange rate as per 31 December 2015 (DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 ­ a total of DKK 6,593m equivalent to USD 1,077m).

Payment of all dividends is expected to take place on 15 April 2016.

Payment of dividends to shareholders does not trigger taxes to the Group.

NOTE 12 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
Equity settled incentive plans (excluding share options plan) The Group has two different equity settled incentive plans. The Restricted Shares Plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have in 2013, 2014 and 2015 been awarded to employees. In 2014, the Group established a Performance Shares Plan for members of the Executive Board and other employees.
The transfer of restricted and performance shares is contingent on the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. Transfer of the performance shares to members of the Executive Board is further contingent on the member still being employed in the Group at the time of publishing of the 2016 Annual Report for A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The actual transfer of performance shares is further contingent upon the degree of certain financial goals being achieved. This means that the number of shares that eventually will vest may be adjusted during the vesting period.
The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividend during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc. A portion of the Group's holding of own shares is reserved for transfer of restricted and performance shares.

The fair value per restricted share at the time of grant is DKK 14,733 (DKK 13,130), which is equal to the volume weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April, 2015 (In 2014 equal to the average closing share price of the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller ­ Mærsk A/S' Annual Report). The fair value per performance share at the time of grant is DKK 13,130 (DKK 13,130), which is equal to the average closing share price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller ­ Mærsk A/S' Annual Report in 2014.
The average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2015 is 1.1 years (1.7 years) and the average remaining contractual life for the performance shares as per 31 December 2015 is 1.3 years (2.3 years).
Cash settled incentive plan In 2015, the Group introduced the Performance Shares Plan to a broader range of employees. The actual settlement of the awards is contingent upon the degree of certain financial goals being achieved, the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination at the date of settlement. This means that the number of awards that eventually will vest may be adjusted during the vesting period. Depending on the agreement, the settlement will take place two or three years after the initial granting and the employee may have the option to settle the awards in shares.
The employees are not entitled to any dividend during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc.

Share options plan In addition to the plans described above, the Group has a Share Options Plan for former partners in Firmaet A.P. Møller and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Share options related to this plan have not been granted in 2015 and 2014.
The share options were granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent on the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least two years and no more than five years have passed from the time of granting. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc. As at 31 March 2015, the exercise prices were reduced by DKK 1,671 corresponding to the extraordinary dividend paid out.
The share options can only be settled in shares. A portion of the Group's holding of own shares is reserved for settlement of granted options.

NOTE 14 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
As employer, the Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which the Group operates. Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprises' share of the obligation is not available.
In 2016, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 83m to funded defined benefit plans (USD 68m in 2015).

NOTE 14 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

The majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are in the UK (79%) and the USA (14%). All of the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the USA are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.
Overall the plans have an average duration of 15 years and approximately 48% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.
As well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher than expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation (although some minimum and maximum limits apply).

The liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19. The sensitivity of the liabilities and pension cost to the key assumptions are as follows:

The Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis and if the plan is in deficit the Trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.
The expected contributions to the UK plans for 2016 are USD 71m (USD 45m in 2015) of which USD 46m (USD 5m in 2015) is deficit recovery contributions. In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF) and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2015, an adjustment of USD 76m (USD 0m) was applied in this respect.

Rates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections (1.25% in 2015 and 2014) for all UK plans.

Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, some entities in the Group participate together with other employers in defined benefit pension and health insurance schemes for current and retired employees (multi-employer plans). The Group has joint and several liability to fund total obligations. In 2015, the Group's contributions are estimated at USD 134m (USD 135m). The Group's share of total contributions paid to the pension schemes over the past five years is in the range of 7% to 13%. The contributions to be paid in 2016 are expected to be USD 132m (USD 140m).
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. The Group's share might be significant and deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Based on the most recent available financial data from the plans' trustees, according to US GAAP, the plan assets totalled USD 8.4bn (USD 8.1bn) and the actuarial value of obligations approximately USD 9.6bn (USD 9.8bn). Net obligations in the plans with deficits totalled USD 1.7bn (USD 2.2bn). Financial data for the four major plans that constitute 84% of total obligations and 84% of total plan assets is less than 1.5 years old. In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment respectively.
Interest rate derivatives swap floating to fixed rates on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement concurrently with the hedged interest expenses. They are also used to swap fixed rates to floating rates, of which some are fair value hedges.
Furthermore, the Group enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.

NOTE 17 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY -- CONTINUED
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

Financial instruments measured at fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels: Level 1 ­ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 ­ Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); Level 3 ­ Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value of listed securities fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of derivatives fall mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities are primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.
Financial instruments carried at amortised cost Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. This was determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
Fair value of listed issued bonds fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted future cash flows.

The main part of the closing balance in 2015 comprises the 19% share in Dansk Supermarked Group. The estimated fair value in DKK in December is equal to the initial valuation of the 19%. The decrease in the carrying amount of the investment can be attributed to the development in the DKK/USD exchange rate since initial recognition.
The valuation is based primarily on a discounted cash flow model with reference to selected listed peers. The model relies on a discount rate of 7.0% (7.4%) reflecting a weighted average of an assumed discount rate for the retail business and an assumed yield for the real estate business as well as a long-term terminal growth rate of 2% (2%). All other things being equal, a 0.25% change in the discount rate will affect total comprehensive income and equity by USD 35-45m (USD 35-50m).

Maersk Group -- Annual Report 2015
NOTE 18 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC.
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: · Market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk · Credit risk · Liquidity risk.
The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's business units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2015.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2015. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.
Currency risk The Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from shipping and oil-related activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, NOK and GBP. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including APM Terminals, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
· Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated
cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed, is estimated to have impact on the Group's profit before tax by USD 0.0bn (negative of USD 0.1bn) and the Group's equity, excluding tax, negatively by USD 0.1bn (USD 0.3bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 16 and 17, and are thus not an expression of the Group's total currency risk.

Notes/Financials

Contents

Interest rate risk The Group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP, SEK and JPY.
The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.5 years (2.6 years). A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by approximately USD 5m (USD 22m). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be positive by approximately USD 33m (USD 59m).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Credit risk The Group has exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.

1 Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, securities and cash and bank balances, excluding securities and balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions.
In addition to the liquidity reserve, the Group had committed loans of USD 245m which are dedicated to financing of specific assets and therefore will only become available at certain times in the future.
Based on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory. USD 687m of undrawn financing commitments were either cancelled or expired during 2015 due to the Group's strong liquidity position. In 2015, the Group issued bonds for USD 1.0bn in the US market and EUR 600m in the euro market. USD 1.8bn of revolving credit facilities were signed in 2015.
The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about four years (about five years at 31 December 2014).

Notes/Financials

It is of great importance for the Group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Group's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Group's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

NOTE 24 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements for 2015 for the Maersk Group have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2014. As of 1 January 2015 the Group has implemented Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 cycles as well as Amendment to IAS 19 `Employee benefits'. The amendments encompass various clarifications and additions to disclosure requirements with no material effect on the financial statements.
CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.
Joint arrangements are entities in which the Group, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.
Entities in which the Group exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered to be associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, part-owned vessels and pool arrangements, which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to the Group's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.
Non-controlling interests' share of profit or loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of the Group's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.
The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For the Group's principal shipping and drilling activities and oil and gas activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and landbased container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The allocation of business activities into segments reflects the Group's character as a conglomerate and is in line with the internal management reporting. Some activities are related, but are managed individually. The reportable segments are as follows:

Maersk Line Maersk Oil APM Terminals
Maersk Drilling
Maersk Tankers Maersk Supply Service Svitzer Damco

Global container shipping activities Oil and gas production and exploration activities Container terminal activities, inland transportation, container depots and repair of containers, etc. Offshore drilling activities as well as operation of land-rigs through 50% ownership of Egyptian Drilling Company Tanker shipping of crude oil, oil products and gas (from 2015 oil only) Global marine services to the oil and gas industry Towing and salvage activities Logistic and forwarding activities

In addition, the Group comprises other businesses, which neither individually nor in aggregate constitute reportable segments. These include, inter alia, Maersk Container Industry, Maersk Aviation and Maersk Training, as well as investments in the associated companies Danske Bank (sold in 2014) and Höegh Autoliners.
The reportable segments do not comprise costs in group functions. Also, oil hedging activities in Maersk Oil Trading and the results of Maersk Oil Trading's activity in the form of purchasing bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of entities in the Group are not allocated to reportable segments.
Revenue between segments is limited except for terminal activities and Damco, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Group's container shipping activities. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Segment profit or loss (NOPAT defined as net operating profit or loss after tax), free cash flow and invested capital comprise items directly related to or which can be allocated to segments. Financial assets, liabilities, income and expenses and cash flows from these items are not attributed to reportable segments. With no effect on the Group`s results or financial position, long-term agreements between segments on reserved capacity in container terminals are treated as operating leases, which under IFRS would be classified as finance leases.
INCOME STATEMENT Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of risk to the buyer.
Revenue from shipping activities is recognised as the service is provided, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Any detention and demurrage fees are recognised at the time of customers' late return or pick-up of containers. Revenue is recognised net of discounts and rebates, some of which are estimated based on volume incentives and other factors.
Oil and gas sales are recognised as revenue upon discharge from the production site. In agreements where tax is settled in oil, an amount corresponding to the sales value is recognised both as revenue and tax.
Revenue from terminal operations, logistics and forwarding activities and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is also included.
For drilling activities, which are typically carried out under long-term agreements with fixed day rates, revenue is recognised for the production time related to the financial year.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term.
Exploration and evaluation costs in the oil and gas activities are expensed as they are incurred.
Share of profit or loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments, including goodwill, and their reversal.

Tax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years of those. Income tax is tax on taxable profits and consists of corporation tax, hydrocarbon tax in Denmark and other countries, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax and oil tax based on gross measures. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Oil tax on gross measures is a special tax in certain countries on the production of hydrocarbons, and is separately disclosed within tax to provide clarity over the Group's overall tax expense. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax of gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Earnings per share is calculated as the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' share of the profit or loss for the year divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding the Group's holding of own shares. Diluted earnings per share is adjusted for the dilution effect of share options issued by the parent company.
STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments and cash flow hedges as well as actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit plans, etc. The Group's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.
On disposal or discontinuation of an entity, the Group's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a non-USD functional currency is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of securities are transferred to the income statement in the event of sale or when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Other comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.
BALANCE SHEET Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets in connection with acquired oil resources (concession rights, etc.) are amortised from the commencement of production until the fields' expected production periods end ­ a period of up to 20 years. Acquired exploration rights are amortised from the date of acquisition for a period of up to five years. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.
For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. For oil production facilities, including facilities under construction, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation generally takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil.

The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:
Ships, rigs, etc. Containers, etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc. Oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields

20-25 years 12 years
10-50 years 10-20 years or concession period, if shorter
5-20 years 3-7 years
up to 20 years

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
The cost of an asset is divided into separate components which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships and rigs when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.
The cost of assets constructed by the Group includes direct and indirect expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment, removal and restoration.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment, if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use, except oil concession rights in scope of IFRS 6.
Lease contracts are classified as operating or finance leases at the inception of the lease. Once determined, the classification is not subsequently reassessed unless there are changes to the contract conditions. Contracts which transfer all significant risks and benefits associated with the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are treated as property, plant and equipment.
Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised at the Group's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.

Securities, including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value and sub sequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for other securities. Securities that form part of the liquidity resources are classified as current assets and value adjustments are recognised in the income statement under financial items. Other equity investments are classified as non-current assets where unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Inventories mainly consist of bunker, containers (manufacturing), spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit or loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.
The translation reserve comprises the Group's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of other equity investments. The reserve for hedges includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of transactions qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting.
Equity settled performance shares, restricted shares and share options allocated to the executive employees of the Group as part of the Group's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding adjustment in equity. Cash settled performance awards allocated to employees below executive levels as part of the Group's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment in other payables.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity and other payables.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events. The item includes, among other, provisions for abandonment of oil fields, legal disputes, onerous contracts, as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the USA. Provisions are recognised on the basis of best estimates and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.
Pension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Pension plans where the Group, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises ­ so called multiemployer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.
Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when the Group controls the timing of dividends, and no taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest com ponent. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet as borrowings.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the cumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities which can be attributed to the hedging relationship. The ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements, including time value for oil price hedges.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES Upon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Any subsequent changes to contingent acquisition costs are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.
When the Group ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as gain (or loss) on sale of non-current assets. The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.

CASH FLOW STATEMENT Cash flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arisen from investments and divestments, principal payments of loans, instalments on finance lease liabilities and equity transactions. Capitalisation of borrowing costs and abandonment costs are considered as non-cash items, and the actual payments of those are included in cash flow from operations.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of the Group's cash management.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and comparative figures are restated. Assets and related liabilities from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement.
Individual assets or groups of assets that are to be disposed of collectively are classified as assets held for sale, when the activities to carry out such a sale have been initiated and the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities of a disposal group that are directly related to assets held for sale are presented correspondingly.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale, except financial assets, etc., are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.
NEW FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS The IASB has issued new standards on Revenue (IFRS 15) and Financial Instruments (IFRS 9). The Group is in the process of preparing for the implementation in 2018 when becoming effective. Although some of the changes are notable in character, the impact at this stage is considered to be limited. Endorsement by the EU is expected prior to the IASB effective date.
Further, in January 2016 a new standard on Leases (IFRS 16) was published according to which contracts with a right to use an identified asset for more than 12 months shall be recognised on the balance sheet subject to various terms. The implications of the new standard are complex and a process will commence in 2016 to evaluate the impact. The Group's operating lease commitments are disclosed in note 19. The IASB effective date is 1 January 2019.
KEY FIGURES IN THE DIRECTORS' REPORT Return on equity is calculated as the profit or loss for the year divided by the average equity.
Equity ratio is calculated as the equity divided by total assets.
Return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is the profit or loss for the year before financial items but after calculated tax, divided by the quarterly average invested capital (equity plus net interest-bearing debt).
The segments' return on invested capital after tax (ROIC) is net operating profit or loss after tax (NOPAT) divided by the quarterly average invested capital, net (segment assets less liabilities).
Cash flow from operating activities per share is the Group's cash flow from operating activities divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding the Group's holding of own shares.
Total market capitalisation is the total number of shares ­ excluding the Group's holding of own shares ­ multiplied by the end-of-year price quoted by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen.

NOTE 25 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its judgements and estimates on historical experience, independent advisors and external data points as well as in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or to settle claims that are raised against the Group, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. This note includes the areas, in which the Group is particularly exposed to a material adjustment of the carrying amounts as at the end of 2015.
GENERAL Aspects of uncertainty In its assumption setting, management deals with uncertainty in different aspects. One aspect of uncertainty is whether an asset or liability exists where the assessment is basis for recognition or derecognition decisions. Another aspect is the measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions about the value of the assets and liabilities that are deemed to exist. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows and the risks inherent in these.
Crude oil prices The future development in the oil price is an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across the Group either directly or indirectly. Directly impacted is Maersk Oil on sales prices, but also in regards to entitlement volume (Qatar), production life times, price of licenses and prospects for exploration and development plans. Maersk Line is directly impacted by the price of bunker oil, but competitive landscape determines the extent to which the results are impacted.
Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Services are indirectly impacted by the demand for rigs and supply vessels as the oil companies may cancel or defer projects and exert pressure for lower rates, more contract flexibility and low cost solutions when oil prices are low. APM Terminals' locations in oil producing countries, e.g. Nigeria, Angola, Russia and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences on the countries' economies, which not only has an effect on volume handled in the terminals, but also on exchange rates.
The decline in the oil price has continued since 2014, where OPEC decided not to adjust the production level as a response to increased supply of oil from non-OPEC countries. Throughout 2015, oil production has exceeded world consumption and oil stocks have increased. The Brent oil price forward curve has followed the declining trend, but showed a significant downward shift towards the end of the year, exacerbated by increased uncertainty on the effect of the removal of Iran sanctions, OPEC countries' willingness and ability to defend their market shares and other highly unpredictable geo political and economic factors.

Projections by oil price analysts show no clear consensus in expectations. The median of the forecasts lies however well above the Brent short-term forward prices and with significant differences between the highest and lowest estimates. The common view is that the oil price will recover, but uncertainty pertains to the timing and strength of recovery and the impact this will have on long-term projects. Management has therefore concluded that using short-term Brent forward prices, with assumptions around long-term price development, is an appropriate basis for assessing asset impairment. This approach will need to be continually evaluated.
The recent oil price projections have caused significant impairment losses across Maersk Oil's portfolio due to the low oil price itself and derived effects on future commerciality, investments and production lives.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The Group carries goodwill of USD 87m (USD 91m) and intangible assets with indefinite lives of USD 37m (USD 48m). The majority of non-current assets are amortised over their useful economic lives. Management assesses impairment indicators across this asset base. Judgement is applied in the definition of cash generating units and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions for impairment tests.
The determination of cash generating units differs for the various businesses. Maersk Line operates its fleet of container vessels in an integrated network for which reason the global container shipping activities are tested for impairment as a single cash generating unit. Maersk Oil tests fields individually or combined, when connected through shared infrastructure. APM Terminals considers each terminal individually in impairment tests, unless when the capacity is managed as a portfolio, which is the case for certain terminals in Northern Europe and Global Ports Investments (Russia). Maersk Drilling considers rigs with the similar functionality and operating environment as cash generating units due to largely interdependent cash flows. Maersk Tankers, Svitzer and Maersk Supply Service group vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing management's ongoing follow-up.
Projected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use. External data is used to the extent possible and centralised processes, involving corporate functions, ensure that indexes or data sources are selected consistently observing differences in risks and other circumstances. Current market values for vessels, rigs, etc. are estimated using acknowledged brokers.
Impairment considerations The low oil price is the key driver of the impairment of assets in Maersk Oil, but the assumptions and judgements about the future are multiple and complex. Below is an overview of the principle impairment indicators and management's approach in the choice of assumptions.

Concession rights in Brazil, USA and Kurdistan

The above has been considered for other fields, which did not lead to impairment in 2015.
Other critical factors in impairment tests of assets employed in Maersk Oil are: effect of cost-saving projects, reservoir evaluation, unitisation options, taxation, inflation and discount rates. The projection of operating expenses is based on the scope of work agreed with parties in joint arrangements and current prices for drilling, etc. The forecasts take into consideration tax rates and tax laws in force at the reporting date. Changes in taxation can have material impact on the recoverable amounts.
Impairment indicators in Maersk Drilling are lower day rates on new contracts and a decline in fair values of rigs and drillships, which in many cases have dropped below carrying amount. The fair value estimates are highly uncertain due to the character of the assets and few transactions. The value in use calculations for the individual cash generating units are sensitive to the day rates expected to apply when contracts expire and to the risks of idle periods in the forecasts. In addition, the discount rate, growth rate and EBITDA margin in the terminal period are critical variables. The day rates in the short to medium term are expected significantly lower than the rates at which the Group has currently contracted. In line with analysts in the market, management expects a gradual move towards more economically sustainable rates in the long-term. No value in use estimates have led to impairment in 2015, but due to the uncertain

prospects for off-contract rigs, and limited headroom in the deepwater segment, impairment losses may be recognised in the coming years, if markets develop significantly adverse compared to current expectations.
In Maersk Line the recent development in freight rates is an impairment indicator, although Maersk Line has generated profits and significant positive cash flows in the year. In addition, the estimated fair value of the fleet continues to be lower than the carrying amount. Consequently, an estimate of the recoverable amount has been prepared by a value in use calculation. The cash flow projection is based on forecasts as per December 2015 covering approved plans for 2016-20. The key sensitivities are: development in freight rates, container volumes, bunker costs, effect of cost savings as well as the discount rate. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes and continued pressure on freight rates, partly offset by increased cost efficiency. The impairment test continues to show headroom from value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable and that the gap to fair value can be explained mainly by Maersk Line performing at margins above the industry average.
APM Terminals' interest in Global Port Investments, being the share of equity and significant intangible assets acquired, was impaired in 2014. For this reason management has reassessed the recoverable amount of its interest in 2015. Uncertain variables in the estimate are the economic outlook in Russia, local competition, effect on volume and operating expenses from the devaluation of the Russian Ruble and discount rate. Offsetting effects prevented impairment in 2015, but the carrying amount of the investment may not be sustainable in the next few years, if markets develop significantly adverse compared to current expectations. Estimates of recoverable amounts were also prepared for a small number of other terminals where decreasing volumes triggered impairment tests. No impairment charge was necessary and the net book value of these facilities is not material.
Refer to notes 6 and 7 for information about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and discount rates.
Amortisation, depreciation and residual values Useful lives are estimated based on past experience. Management decides from time to time to revise the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. For oil production facilities the production period is based on management's judgement of when it will no longer be commercially viable to extract more oil or gas, which is highly dependent of the future oil price, production costs and the technical feasibility for extraction. Refer to note 24 for the useful lives typically used for new assets.
Residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of vessels and rigs, the uncertainty as to future economic conditions and the future price of steel, which is considered as the main determinant of the residual price. As a general rule the residual values of vessels and rigs are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price exclusive dry-docking costs. The long-term view is prioritised in order to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.
ABANDONMENT OBLIGATIONS In oil and gas activities provisions are made for the cost of plugging wells, removing production facilities and re-establishing the environment (sea bed etc.). The recognised obligation is based on contractual agreements and current regulatory requirements.

AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION

Decommissioning costs are highly judgemental, although driven by the Group's own plans made in cooperation with partners and other interests. The Group has limited actual experience with offshore abandonment and local conditions can be different. The forecast period is long and the discount rates are therefore key variables in the estimates. Management has used engineering studies performed in-house to revise the estimates in 2015. The methodology used is consistent with general industry practice. Expected timing of the use of the provision and average discount rates can be found in note 15.
PROVISIONS FOR PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS For defined benefit schemes management makes assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and discount rates. When setting those assumptions management takes advice from the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country by country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a plan by plan basis. Refer to note 14 for information about key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in those.
Plan assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.
PROVISIONS FOR LEGAL DISPUTES, ETC. Management's estimate of the provisions in connection with legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. The resolution of legal disputes, either through negotiations or litigation, can take several years to complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.
The Group is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of various scope. Appropriate provision has been made where the probability of payment of additional taxes in individual cases is considered more likely than not. Demands, for which the probability of payment is assessed by management to be less than 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area, and country risk provisions are established where the aggregated risk of additional payments is more likely than not.
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Judgement has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to the Group's ability to utilise the assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 415m (USD 237m), excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated in the development of oil and gas fields, during construction of terminals or in mobilisation of drilling rigs, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or is expected within a foreseeable future.
ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL, JOINT CONTROL OR SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE The Group's control, joint control or significant influence over an entity or activity is subject to an assessment of power and exposure to variability in returns.
The assessment of control in oil and gas activities entails analysis of the status of operators in joint arrangements. Operators are responsible for the daily management of the activities carried out within the jointly established framework. Since operators are not exposed to, and have no right to, returns beyond the participating share, and since they can

be replaced by agreement, the operators are regarded as agents as defined in IFRS 10. Operators of pool arrangements in shipping are assessed similarly.
When assessing joint control, an analysis is carried out to determine which decisions require unanimity and whether these concern the activities that significantly affect the returns. Joint control is deemed to exist when business plans, work programmes and budgets are unanimously adopted. Within oil and gas activities, an assessment of joint control is carried out for each phase. These are typically exploration and development, production and decommissioning. Unanimity is often not required during the production phase. Given that the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the arrangements' assets or liabilities regardless of voting rights, the arrangements are accounted for as joint operations during all phases.
For pool arrangements in shipping, unanimity is not required in decisions on relevant activities. However, the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the unit's assets or liabilities, and as the pool arrangements are not structured into separate legal entities, they are treated as joint operations.
LEASING Judgement is applied in the classification of lease as operating or finance lease. The Group enters into a substantial amount of lease contracts, some of which are combined lease and service contracts like time charter agreements. Management applies a formalised process for classification and estimation of present values for finance leases with use of specialised staff in corporate functions.

NOTE 11 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
AMOUNTS IN USD MILLION
Equity settled incentive plans (excluding share options plan) The Group has two different equity settled incentive plans. The Restricted Shares Plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have in 2013, 2014 and 2015 been awarded to employees. In 2014, the Group established a Performance Shares Plan for members of the Executive Board and other employees.
The transfer of restricted and performance shares is contingent on the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. Transfer of the performance shares to members of the Executive Board is further contingent on the member still being employed in the Group at the time of publishing of the 2016 Annual Report for A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
The actual transfer of performance shares is further contingent upon the degree of certain financial goals being achieved. This means that the number of shares that eventually will vest may be adjusted during the vesting period.
The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividend during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc. A portion of the Company's holding of own shares is reserved for transfer of restricted and performance shares.

Interest rate derivatives swap floating to fixed rates on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement concurrently with the hedged interest expenses. They are also used to swap fixed rates to floating rates of which some are fair value hedges.
Furthermore, the Company enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.

Financial instruments measured at fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels: Level 1 ­ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 ­ Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); Level 3 ­ Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Company's profit or equity significantly.
Financial instruments carried at amortised cost Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. This was determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
Fair value of listed issued bonds falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items falls within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.

The main part of the closing balance in 2015 comprises the 19% share in Dansk Supermarked Group. The estimated fair value in DKK in December is equal to the initial valuation of the 19%. The decrease in the carrying amount of the investment can be attributed to the development in the DKK/USD exchange rate since initial recognition.
The valuation is based primarily on a discounted cash flow model with reference to selected listed peers. The model relies on a discount rate of 7.0% (7.4%) reflecting a weighted average of an assumed discount rate for the retail business and an assumed yield for the real estate business as well as a long-term terminal growth rate of 2% (2%). All other things being equal, a 0.25% change in the discount rate will affect total comprehensive income and equity by USD 35-45m (USD 35-50m).

NOTE 16 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC.

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company's Business Units.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2015.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2015. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rate.
Currency risk The Company's currency risk arises due to income from shipping and oil-related activities are denominated mainly in USD, while the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as DKK, EUR, CNY and GBP. Overall the Company has net income in USD and net expenses in most other currencies. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. The majority of the Company's borrowings is thus in USD.
The main purpose of hedging the Company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Company's profit. The Company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
· Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon; · Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; · Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Company is exposed, is estimated to have an impact on the Company's profit before tax by USD 0.0bn (positive by USD 0.3bn) and the Company's equity, excluding tax, by USD 0.0bn (positive by USD 0.1bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 14 and 15, and are thus not an expression of the Company's total currency risk.

NOTE 16 FINANCIAL RISKS, ETC. -- CONTINUED

Interest rate risk The Company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP and SEK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The Company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained through the use of interest rate swaps.
A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to affect profit before tax negatively by approximately USD 40m (USD 22m). The effect on equity, excluding tax effect, of an increase in interest rates as mentioned above is estimated to be negative by approximately USD 8m (positive by USD 56m).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Liquidity risk It is of great importance for the Company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things, by focusing on release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
The Board of Directors' and the Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements The Board of Directors and the Management are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies and for such internal control that management determines is necessary to enable the

preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
