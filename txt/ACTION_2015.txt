MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ACTION S.A. (Company/Issuer) ON OPERATIONS IN 2015
1. Basic figures and development prospects for the next business year
In 2015, ACTION S.A. reached sales revenues of PLN 4 685,978 thousand. The operating profit amounted to PLN 36,727 thousand and the net profit PLN 24,088 thousand. The above figures, compared with the same values reached in 2014, decreased by 3.43% with respect to sales revenues, 60,17% with respect to operating profit and 65,34% with respect to net profit.
These figures are the consequences of many factors, among them, changes resulting from the offer of technologically advanced devices being smaller than in previous years, the introduction of new tax regulations and the growing consolidation of both, suppliers and retail networks. All these changes had a material impact on the demand recorded in 2015. Additionally, a relatively sudden and unforeseeable nature of these changes caused the margins at all levels of activity to be lower than assumed.
In the coming year, the Management Board does not envisage any significant changes in relation to technologically advanced devices launched and the entities offering these devices. In the Management Board's opinion, the main factors influencing the financial performance in the future are:
Regarding internal factors: a) an ongoing analysis of the phenomena occurring in the markets served and taking decisions aimed at the best possible adjustment of the offer to the tendencies observed; b) an ongoing control of transaction profitability and cost-effectiveness of the existing structures; c) further growth of activities on e-commerce markets; d) further expansion of what we offer to include new business areas such as toys and medical equipment; e) further improvement of activities in the handling of tenders and Enterprise; f) maintenance and gradual growth of export markets and expansion of Action Europe GmbH operating on the German market; g) better use of the advantages stemming from the expansion of the logistics centre in Zamienie; h) maintaining a wide base of customers representing all sales channels; i) further monitoring of the markets served and active participation in the sales channels that have been newly created or not used so far; j) maintaining strict ongoing monitoring of costs in the Company and in the Capital Group; k) ongoing monitoring and active management of the working capital; l) optimising the structure of the ACTION Capital Group and the performance of the entities constituting it;
Regarding external factors: a) economic and political situation in Poland and worldwide; b) consequences of the implemented or planned changes in the law, in particular the consequences of the implementation of the Family 500 Plus programme and other regulations supporting consumers; c) changes of regulations regarding health care, in particular, with respect to the existence and functioning of NFZ (National Health Fund); d) technological changes affecting the innovation of the products offered and the development of the Internet of Things; e) changes in the current and long-term monetary policy in Poland and worldwide;

f) demand for the goods offered by the Company.

2. Significant risk factors related to the operation of the Company
2.1. Risk factors related to the Company's operation
2.1.1. Stockholding risk The main activity of the Company is the sale of technologically advanced goods, which are naturally exposed to the process of ageing and the resulting loss of value. Producers who market new models of products then lower the prices of the products they previously offered. As a result of the price protection clauses contained in the contracts with suppliers and the existing market practice in this area, the Company receives coverage of losses connected with the loss of value from all its key suppliers. Irrespective of the benefits arising from the price protection mechanisms, the Company tries to maintain high rotation of its stocks.
2.1.2. Risk of losing receivables When it comes to value, trade receivables are the most important item in the Company's assets. As any other entity dealing in trade, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some part of its receivables. This risk increases with increasing economic slow-down in Poland and in the world. Bearing in mind the possibility of losing its receivables, the Company insures this risk, using the services of leading insurers.
Detailed information regarding financial instruments in the scope of: a) price risk, credit risk, cash flow risk and liquidity risk, to which the entity is exposed, b) financial risk management objectives and methods adopted by the entity, including the methods which are used to hedge major types of forecasted transactions in respect of which hedge accounting method is used, was included in Note 30 Financial Instruments and Note 25 Hedge Accounting of the Separate Financial Statement.
2.2.Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates
2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation in Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. The eagerness of dealers to purchase new IT hardware, and consequently the value of purchases exercised by the recipients of the Company, are essentially related to growth in GDP, the level of investments, and the way that retail consumers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.

ACTION S.A.

2.2.2. Exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to a foreign exchange risk. ACTION S.A. obtains over 60% of its sales revenues in Polish zloty while about 60% of goods are imported. Payments for imported goods are made mainly in EUR and in USD. Such a currency structure of cash flows exposes the Company to foreign exchange risk. The risk increases proportionally to the changes observed in the FX market. The Company tries to minimise the FX risk. For that reason, in 2011 the Company adopted the FX Risk Management Policy. The rules regarding the FX risk management adopted in the policy set optimal levels of hedging related to the existing currency positions and determine a system for monitoring and control related thereto. In accordance with the adopted hedge accounting principles, the Company is obliged to maintain hedges amounting to nearly 100% of the open currency position on an ongoing basis.

2.2.3. Legal environment risk The changing laws and various interpretations thereof constitute a risk to the operations of ACTION S.A. Potential changes of the law may lead in a direction that will cause adverse effects for the Company's operations. These changes may significantly influence the legal environment of the business activity. Bringing into effect a new regulation important for business life may lead to interpretation problems, incoherent court decisions, unfavourable interpretations assumed by the public administration organs, etc.

2.2.4.

Tax system risk

The Polish tax system is characterised by frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of them are not

defined precisely enough and their interpretation is not unequivocal. Interpretations of the tax provisions

are subject to frequent changes; however, neither the practices applied by tax authorities nor the court

rulings related to taxation are unified. Due to divergent interpretations of the tax provisions, the risk is

greater in the case of a Polish company than in the case of a company operating in a more stable tax

system. In such circumstances the Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements

and tax returns may be deemed at variance with the tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. It is,

however, expected that the proceedings before administrative courts consisting of two instances and the

acquis communautaire will significantly influence the uniformity of court decisions related to taxes,

leading in consequence to higher uniformity of tax law application, exercised by the tax authorities as

well. One of the elements of the risk arising from tax regulations are the provisions related to the expiry

of the limitation period of the tax obligation, which is connected with the possibility to verify whether tax

liabilities were calculated correctly for the given period. Tax declarations determining the amount of tax

liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by the inspection of tax authorities within five

years following the end of the year in which the due date for the payment of the tax expired. In the case

the tax authorities adopt an interpretation of tax regulations different than the interpretation adopted by

the Company, which is the basis for the calculation of the tax liability, the situation may have adverse

impact on the operations of the Company, its financial situation, and, in consequence, its results and

growth perspectives.

3. Corporate governance policies

ACTION S.A. is subject to the corporate governance principles: "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies" adopted by Resolution no. 12/1170/2007 of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 4 April 2007, the text hereof is included in the annexe to the above mentioned resolution.

2015 ended for the Company with a decrease of its current assets by 10.48% mainly in connection with a significant drop in the value of maintained inventories while the value of the assets adjusted by the cash held decreased by 4.23%.

This event, on the one hand, positively limited tax risk of the suppliers and recipients but also influenced the purchasing decisions of the recipients negatively, meaning that in June the recipients withheld with their purchases of electronic devices covered by the reverse VAT charge.
