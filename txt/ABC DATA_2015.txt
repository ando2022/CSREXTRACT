3.2 Sales Markets
The ABC Data Capital Group sells goods to the following groups of clients:
 traditional IT companies, SME segment;  e-shops;  retail chains;  system integrators providing comprehensive IT services to large institutions;  wholesalers and sub-distributors;  telecom operators;  foreign clients.
For over 17 years, communication of the ABC Data Group companies with their clients has been developed through Internet platforms. As a result, the Capital Group companies hold leading positions on their domestic markets in terms of online client service. The InterLink system, developed in Poland, translated into eight languages and adapted in all markets in which the ABC Data Capital Group operates, remains a referential B2B solution in the IT and other industries. The system allows for comprehensive transaction support to include placing orders, checking inventory levels, controlling order status, obtaining information regarding payments and trade credits available or the status of pending complaints. The system allows serving clients who operate in various countries, in local languages, using local currencies, within an integrated logistic system. InterLink has been continuously developed, which has resulted in improved functionality and work comfort. Today the Capital Group companies receive over 85% of their orders through this B2B platform via the Internet. Up to 90 000 orders a month are placed using the InterLink and the platform has up to 6 000 users a day.
The registered office and the logistic center of ABC Data S.A. are located in Warsaw. At present, the Company has two warehouses in Poland (in Warsaw and Sosnowiec, with a surface area of 20 000 sq. m. and 11,500 sq. m., respectively). In January 2015, ABC Data began cooperation with a logistic partner in Romania, which has provided the Company with 10 000 sq. m of warehouse space that can be flexibly adjusted to our logistic needs (at present, the Company uses just a small percentage of the available space, incurring only the costs of the occupied space). Such a model ensures minimized fixed costs, while variable expenses arise from actual warehouse related needs. ABC Data S.A. ul.

Organization of the sales system allows supplying the entire territory of buyers of the ABC Data Capital Group from domestic warehouses.

ABC Data S.A. not only fulfils the condition, but delivers goods on the same day in Warsaw, Kraków and Katowice agglomerations. ABC Data cooperates with e-shops, for which the ability to deliver products directly to end-users is of key importance.

3.3 Suppliers
The Company cooperates with global IT manufacturers. The highest share in the total sales is generated by manufacturers of computers, peripherals and components. The Capital Group's supplier structure is quite dispersed (over 430 suppliers).
3.4 Major R&D Achievements
The Company continuously develops its IT tools including those related to Interlink, i.e. the leading B2B e-commerce on the IT distribution market. For many years, tool development has been an evolutionary process and it has not resulted in any significant one-off capital expenditure.
As regards e-commerce, ABC Data takes advantage of its own potential and uses advanced analytical tools and tools supporting Internet channel sales in order to focus mainly on optimization of the current platforms. New functionalities are increasingly added to the tools with a view to actively support sales of ABC Data products by resellers. Furthermore, the Group systematically expands the portfolio of its advanced solutions targeting a wider group of B2B clients, e.g. cutting-edge mobile platforms.
When planning its e-commerce and the surrounding IT environment, the Company puts great stress on its security, efficiency and sales opportunities. This facilitates a fast growth of the platform in terms of the commercial offer as well as regional growth. In this area, the Company plans on implementing dedicated tools supporting sale of software licenses, adding subscription services to the existing sales models and launching sale of cloud hosting services on the Company's e-commerce platforms.
On account of the quantity and quality of data gathered and processed by ABC Data, the Company concentrates on integrating the existing analytical solutions with innovative business intelligence systems. This will allow it to use the full potential of Big Data to optimize its internal procedures regarding offering, maximize sales conversion and expand the sales offer in the most efficient way ensuring that the clients' and business partners' needs are met. The Group intensified work on developing internal analytical systems and implementing tools for effective market penetration in order to improve the quality and attractiveness of the commercial offer in the e-commerce channel.
The launch of the -commerce Section within the organization enables the Company to execute e-commerce projects dynamically, effectively and in line with the latest trends and technological solutions. All initiatives are based

on in-depth research and interviews with the Company's key resellers and new partners who plan on tying their IT business to ABC Data S.A.
3.5 Environmental Matters
Environmental matters related to ABC Data S.A. stem from regulations concerning: - waste electrical and electronic equipment; - batteries; - packages and wastes, including package wastes; - substances and chemicals.
Under regulations on waste electrical and electronic equipment, ABC Data S.A., being an entity introducing products to the market, is obliged to organize and finance collecting waste equipment and ensure processing, including recycling and disposing of used equipment from households and non-household users. Moreover, the first marketer of the equipment is obliged to collect a certain annual minimum level of equipment from households and carry out public educational campaigns. The Company has transferred its obligations ­ to the greatest extent possible ­ arising from the Act on waste electrical and electronic equipment of 11 September 2015 to ElektroEko Organizacja Odzysku Sprztu Elektrycznego i Elektronicznego S.A., under the relevant agreement signed with the latter. The Company declares that it has complied with all regulations on waste electrical and electronic equipment.
The Company transferred its obligations arising from the Act on batteries of 24 April 2009 (Journal of Laws of 2015 item 687 as amended) and the Act amending the Act on Batteries and some other acts of 29 August 2014 to Polski System Recyklingu Organizacja Odzysku Opakowa SA to the greatest extent possible, in particular collection, processing, recycling and disposal of used batteries.
Waste and packaging management has been regulated in several acts of law, in particular in: - the Act on waste of 14 December 2012, including changes made by the Act amending the Act on waste of 15 January 2015; - the Act on packaging and packaging waste of 13 June 2013; - the Act on obligations of entrepreneurs covering management of selected wastes and product and deposit fees of 11 May 2001 (Journal of Laws of 2014 item 1413 as amended).
The Company has transferred its obligations under the acts specified above to Polski System Recyklingu Organizacja Odzysku SA to the extent possible. The agreement with Polski System Recyklingu Organizacja Odzysku Opakowa SA was terminated in January 2016. The Company signed an agreement with INTERSEROH Organizacja Odzysku Opakowa S.A. The agreement is a continuation of the terminated agreement because INTERSEROH is the owner of Polski System Recyklingu Organizacja Odzysku Opakowa SA. The Company declares that it has complied with all regulations on recycling of packaging and waste, including packaging waste. In particular, the Company reduces the volume and negative impact on the environment of industrial waste produced in the course of its business operations and it ensures disposal of waste which could not have been avoided or recycled, in line with environmental protection regulations.
The Company performed a thorough analysis and assessment of its operations against the requirements of the Act on chemical substances and mixtures of 25 February 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2015 item 1203 as amended) and the REACH Regulation. The Company requested its suppliers to provide information on their products' compliance with REACH Regulation in order to mitigate a trade risk related to registration of chemical substances and the obligation to provide information on product characteristic and their safe application. By the end of 2012, the Company had received declarations from the majority of its suppliers stating that products supplied do not contain any chemical substances which could be produced intentionally during standard or predictable use. The Company has been collecting all documents required from its suppliers for substances of very high concern, the candidate list of which was published by the European Chemicals Agency on 28 October 2008. In view of the requirements in question the Company does not intend to limit the availability of any products offered.

In 2015 the number of employees in individual teams was adapted to the efficiency ratios. Furthermore, new employees were recruited for the new product groups to develop the new business lines: Mobile/ Telco, Consumer Electronics, Value +, e-commerce.

Along with the announcement of its strategy, ABC Data launched the "High Performance Organization" project. It focuses on improving the Company's four key areas: measurement of effectiveness of individual departments, building employee involvement, improvement in internal communication, and leadership skills and talent development.

The Company uses an advanced human capital effectiveness measurement system. A test has indicated that the Company's Human Capital ROI is high and it uses its personnel effectively. The results have helped develop a comprehensive HR development system. Which includes the "ABC Data Academy" project. The Academy consists of a number of educational and development programs. The launch of four of them has been planned for 2016. The programs are: "Positive Productivity", "ABC Data Leadership Academy", "ABC Data Sales Academy" and "ABC Data English Academy". The first aims at optimization of a lot of processes in the Company and introduction of the LEAN concept. The other three will predominantly facilitate development of professional and personal skills of ABC Data's employees.

In 2015 the Company also modified the compensation system in the front office area and incentive system adapting it to the existing strategy and market challenges in the future. As a consequence of the first employee involvement survey in the whole Capital Group which was supported by the international company Aon Hewitt, the Company launched "Join the game" program to improve involvement of the employees in ABC Data. The program will be the key element supporting implementation of the strategy and striving to reach above average individual, team and company results.

Summary:  increase the market share in Poland to 25% in 2018;  increase the CEE market share to 10% in 2018;  advance to the position of CEE leader through strengthening market position on individual markets: - Poland ­ number one by 2018 - Three key countries in the region ­ in the top three by 2018 - Baltic States ­ light scenario; - German market ­ light scenario;  organic growth and M&A;  streamline the processes and optimize costs ­ ERP implementation;  implement High Performance Organization approach;  the ABC Data Capital Group to achieve the value of PLN 1 billion by 2018.
The changes made as a consequence of the new strategy have resulted in a stronger position of ABC Data on individual markets in the region, as well as an increase in the number of clients.
6.2 Company and the Capital Group's Growth Perspectives
One of the key objectives of the Company is to grow sales in the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Hungary. To this aim, the Company expands its product offer and the client base, in particular in the SME, retail, system integrator and telecommunication operator sectors.
Another development driver is intensifying works aimed at opening fully functional online shops managed by the Company's Trade Partners. Furthermore, the Capital Group will continue developing B2B and B2B2C tools.
Cooperation with telecom operators and adding telecom products to the offer remains one of the most promising development directions of the Company. The Company has undertaken measures aimed at continuous cooperation with telecom operators through conclusion of individual high-volume transactions, still the growth potential of the cooperation is high. Similarly as in distribution of telecom devices (GSM and smartphones), manufacturers have just begun to notice opportunities and benefits arising from cooperation with IT distributors, especially those succeeding in cooperation with demanding clients, such as large retail networks.
Today the fastest growing IT area is the Internet of Things. According to Gartner's very conservative estimations, over 25 bn. devices will be connected to the Internet worldwide by 2020. The potential for development in the sector is immense, therefore ABC Data is consistently expanding its solutions offering in this respect, including an addition of smart fir, smart health and smart home categories.
A further growth in sales in the consumer electronics, household appliances, computer game software and hardware markets is also increasingly important.
Value-added services (VAD) is another important area for development. In ABC Data this sector is being developed within the Value+ department. The Company offers a wide range of VAD services including audit of the existing IT resources, defining the optimum hardware and software needs, testing system effectiveness and security level, and advice on the optimal utilization of equipment and services ­ purchasing, leasing, outsourcing. The Company provides training to resellers and end-buyers (certified by manufacturers), business intelligence and system upgrades introducing new technological solutions.
ABC Data's Value + department is also developing its own equipment, software and cloud computing product offering. It is regarded as one of the most promising areas on the IT market. The product offering of ABC Data ABC Data S.A. ul. Daniszewska 14, 03-230 Warsaw, NIP: 524-26-17-178, tel.: +48 022/676 09 00, fax: +48 022/614 16 16 sekretariat@abcdata.eu

includes solutions of the best international cloud computing brands. In addition to that, the Company is developing advanced VAD services based on their own product portfolio.
6.3 Development Factors Material for the Operations of the Capital Group
6.3.1 Macro-economic Environment Influencing Operations of the Group; IT Industry Standing
The key factors to shape the Company's operations in the reporting period and in the following year are:
 continuous increase in the IT market in the countries of ABC Data's direct presence, stimulated by economic growth and development of CE countries but slower than in previous years;
 growing role of Polish enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe that stimulates exports;  strong pricing competition in most IT product groups;  growing market share of the largest IT distributors;  uncertain standing of markets where ABC Data Group operates due to possible negative effects of events
taking place in the Eurozone on the macro-economic standing of the region, in particular of less developed countries;  changes material to the industry made to tax law in 2015 ­ imposition of reverse VAT on some electronic products;  M&A activity among the leading global IT distributors in Central and Eastern Europe.
6.4 Risks
Risk Related to Macro-economic Standing of Poland and Other Countries where the Group Operates
Growth of the IT sector is closely related with the general economic standing of Poland and other countries, in which the Group carries out its operations. Polish economy is sensitive to the global economic situation, in particular to the EU standing. Possible rapid market break may have substantial adverse impact on the financial performance of the Company and the entire Group. GDP growth in each country, IT expense level, pay level, investment in enterprises, inflation and foreign exchange rates are the key factors influencing the Group's financial performance. There is a risk that a slowdown in economic growth of the Group's markets, reduced investment and public procurement level or an inflation increase may negatively impact operations and financial standing of the Parent and subsidiaries, their performance and development perspectives. The political situation in Ukraine has no material impact on the sales of the ABC Data Capital Group. In particular it did not result in any major problems with insolvency of the Clients of the Company's Capital Group. The Companies in the ABC Data Group have not carried out any major sales projects in the Ukrainian market.
Margin Reduction Risk
All markets on which ABC Data Group operates are highly competitive. Growing competition arising from new market entries, increasing saturation with IT products and aggressive pricing may result in trade margin reductions.
Margin control including all key factors that contribute to its amount, active response to margin drops and substantial diversification of the Group's offer allow significant risk mitigation.
Foreign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of products offered by the Company come from foreign suppliers. Settlement of foreign currency transactions concluded with suppliers and clients gives rise to the risk of revenue and expense fluctuation caused by changes in forex rates, which may negatively affect the Company's performance.

Management Board's Report on the Activities of the ABC Data Capital Group for FY 2015
The purchase structure of the Group is generally centralized in ABC Data S.A. in Warsaw. Then, the goods are sold to local clients by subsidiaries located in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary (which, except of Romania, do not have separate warehouses). Very few goods are purchased directly by the subsidiaries. Since deliveries from the head office to the subsidiaries are denominated in the currency used by these companies when selling to their clients, their forex risk is very small, and the entire risk management process lies with ABC Data S.A., the parent.
The Parent attempts to mitigate the negative effect of forex rate changes through pro-active forex risk management. For this purpose, ABC Data S.A. applies solutions involving daily indexing prices of the offered products in foreign currencies. Such a pricing policy allows, on the one hand, flexible adjustment of domestic currency prices to the current exchange rates, and on the other hand, the use of inventory of goods expressed in foreign currencies as a natural hedge against the forex risk arising from foreign currency liabilities.
The purpose of parent's currency position management is to maintain a balanced asset and liability position in each currency including the inventory level. Spot, forward and currency swap transactions are the key financial instruments used to hedge currency positions. In 2015, the Group did not use currency options as forex risk hedges.
The parent has implemented hedge accounting involving hedging of the future cash flows from trading operations with regard to the pricing system and the relevant forex risk policy, as well as in order to mitigate financial effects of rapid forex rate changes and their impact on the Group's performance. This allows allocating forex differences to periods they actually pertain to, and thus limiting the risk of incidental misstatement of financial profit/loss in a given period.
Interest Rate Risk
During the reporting period the Company's liabilities included short-term bank loans and factoring facilities with interest rates based mostly on monthly base rates for a given currency increased by bank's margin. Since intercompany deliveries of purchases for Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary and Romania are centralized in ABC Data S.A. in Warsaw, the parent finances most of the operations. Purchases made by the subsidiaries: Czech, Slovakian, Lithuanian, Hungarian and Romanian are funded through trade liabilities to the Parent.
A significant increase of market interest rates may adversely impact the financial performance of the Company. Risk mitigation and prevention measures involve continuous monitoring of the money market standing and active managing of balance sheet items that impact working capital, although do not include financial instruments hedging against forex rate risk.
Business Acquisition Risk
Accelerating business growth by acquiring other entities is an important element of the strategy adopted by the ABC Data Group. The Company may be forced to withdraw from investing in certain entities if acquisition transactions, initially evaluated as attractive, generate too much risk or the transaction price expected by their owners will render them not viable economically. Also, if transactions are concluded, future financial performance of acquirees and the presumed synergy effect may be lower than planned.
Product Price Risk
Continuous reduction of product prices arising from their progressing technical obsolescence and launch of new products is characteristic of the IT market. The Company purchases goods directly from IT hardware manufacturers for further distribution. During pre-sale storage, prices of individual products may drop following reductions introduced by manufacturers. Price protection clauses included in contracts concluded with key supplies, i.e. manufacturers of goods and market practice protect against the risk. They allow for obtaining a refund of a portion of the cost of unsold goods if the sales price to Group's clients decline. Manufacturer bearing full responsibility for price changes of goods held in distributor's warehouse is the standard distribution market practice.
The Company does not store high volumes of goods purchased from distributors in order to avoid the risk of a price drop. Such transactions are usually concluded based on specific orders of the Company's buyers. Nevertheless, in order to limit the price risk, the Group focuses on maximizing inventory turnover.

Management Board's Report on the Activities of the ABC Data Capital Group for FY 2015
Debt Risk
During the reporting period the Company used borrowings in the form of short-term bank loans, intercompany loans and factoring facilities. The Parent is the one charged with funding of the Group's operations as it operates the central warehouse supplying products for sale by distribution subsidiaries.
The Parent uses services of six banks providing loans to fund the Parent's operations and five separate factoring facilities for selected clients of ABC Data S.A. in Warsaw for the purpose of discounting receivables from these clients on an ongoing basis.
Due to the commercial nature of the operations of the Company and Capital Group, the amount of funding closely depends on the level of sales and working capital management quality (turnover of receivables, liabilities and inventory). Receivables, liabilities and inventory turnover is monitored on an ongoing basis in order to limit the amount of borrowings, at the same time optimizing product availability and attractiveness of trade credits offered to the Company's clients. Apart from planning the demand for borrowings in its annual budget, the Company keeps monitoring its debt and cash flows to be able to undertake relevant measures aimed at obtaining more funds necessary to ensure paying its trade liabilities within contractual deadlines if necessary.
According to the Management Board, the current limits cover the potential demand for working capital both in the Company and Capital Group, and the risk that the banks providing the funding will be not willing to extend the funding agreements is limited.
Supplier Risk
The Company's operations are based on cooperation with key IT hardware suppliers. According to the Management Board, there are no suppliers so important that disruption in cooperation with them would have a material negative impact on the sales performance of the Company. A broad portfolio of products allows efficient management of relationships with suppliers and offering clients with alternative solutions if temporary shortages or price fluctuations occur.
IT and Telecom System Risk
Due to its operational specifics, the Company's efficiency closely depends on data flow and processing speed. Therefore, continuous improvement and uninterrupted operation of IT tools supporting communication and management is crucial. The Company has systematically extended and improved its IT infrastructure supporting business management processes. Despite being modern and efficient, the risk of IT system breakdown cannot be excluded, nor can be a future threat of its reduced efficiency due to growing scale of operations or other factors, including those beyond the Company's control. Any reduction in efficiency of the IT infrastructure used by the Group may have an adverse effect on business management, development strategy implementation and financial performance.
The Company has monitored efficiency of its IT solutions on an ongoing basis, improved and extended it to match the Company's growth. Additionally, the Group has a team of IT specialists able to promptly repair potential breakdowns. The Group has implemented a system ensuring data control and recovery in crisis situations.
Risk Related to Loss of Key Employees
Operations of the Company and its development perspectives depend on knowledge, experience and qualifications of Management Board members and other key managers. Strong demand for IT specialists and competitors' activities may result in key personnel leaving the company and slow down the recruitment of new hires with relevant background and skills. There is a risk that the losing of key employees will negatively impact the operations and financial standing of the Company, its financial performance and growth perspectives. Please note, however, that employee turnover in the Group is on the standard level the survey by Saratoga shows. In addition, in order to reduce the aforesaid risk, the Company has implemented various employee development programs, benefit programs, modified its incentive systems and launched the High Performance Organization program. The Company has seen a growth in demand for highly qualified employees and managers. It continues its focus on Employer Branding initiatives.

Management Board's Report on the Activities of the ABC Data Capital Group for FY 2015
Risk Related to Trade Credits Granted
The Company offers trade credits to its business partners, and as a result it is exposed to the risk of losing receivables due to potential insolvency of their counterparties.
The risk is limited with group or individual insurance policies for trade receivables concluded by all Group companies. Insurance decisions determine internal decisions made with regard to trade credit limits for Group clients. In most cases, such limits do not exceed the level of coverage granted by the insurer.
The companies within the Group use an internal integrated CRM system allowing analysis of risk related to clients, including the history of contracts, value of orders and timeliness of payment, as well as analysis, approval and management of credit limits for individual clients.
Receivables from clients are monitored on an ongoing basis. In case of overdue payments, sales are suspended and immediate collection measures are implemented. The efficient procedure of trade credit granting, verifying and monitoring, bad debt level has remained flat.
Risk Related to the Seasonality of Sales
The Company's sales are of seasonal nature, which involves the sales level exceeding the sales average in the fourth quarter of a given year. Capital expenditure of institutional clients and increased purchases of retail clients over the Christmas period contribute most to the trend.
There is a risk that a growth in sales in the fourth quarter may result in an increased demand for working capital in the period.
Risk Related to Damage or Loss of Goods in Warehouse Following Force Majeure
Gathering goods of substantial value in one place gives rise to a risk of exposing it to force majeure, such as fire, flood etc. Please note that all Company's assets (including inventories) are insured, as well as a potential loss of income.
The above events may substantially limit or even suspend operations of the Company and Capital Group companies. This in turn may temporarily disrupt trade relations with clients and may damage their trust in ABC Data as a supplier.
Risk Related to Changes in Tax Regulations and State Administration Reform
For many years, the internal EU market of goods covered by VAT has been facing a problem whereby entities taking part in the sales process generate all or a substantial portion of their profits from late VAT payment or a complete failure to pay VAT. This poses a risk to all entities involved in international trade and filing for a VAT refund. The issue has been the topic of a heated debate among EN commissioners trying to create the same mechanisms for all EU Member States to eliminate dishonest competitors who gain advantage as a result of VAT fraud.
Today the Ministry of Finance is also involved in solving VAT fraud problems and has announced a number of regulations to the tax system and operation of the tax administration reform. All the projects are in the preparatory stage so it is hard to predict their final shape and implementation dates. The closest to materialization is the idea of the Standard Audit File, i.e. a mechanism that allows monitoring the work of the accounting function in a company as well as automating tax data verification, which can expedite tax audits and inspections as well as verification of correctness of tax returns. This will help counteract irregularities such as VAT fraud or tax evasion. The solution proposed aims to improve the quality of services provided to businesses and a more effective response to the threats faced by tax systems.

Management Board's Report on the Activities of the ABC Data Capital Group for FY 2015
In order to minimize the risk arising from dishonest practices of competitors and thus protect to its own interest, the Company has been verifying all possible implementable internal procedures with respect to exercise of due professional care since 2012.
Major Shareholder Risk
As at 31 December 2015, MCI Group companies held jointly 61.52% of shares in the share capital, corresponding to 61.54% of votes at the General Shareholders' Meeting. As at the date of publishing the financial statements, MCI Group companies held jointly 61.52% of shares in the share capital, corresponding to 61.52% of votes at the General Shareholders' Meeting.

At the same time during the reporting period and by the date of publication of this report, the number of the Company's shares held by the entities in the MCI Group did not change.
The impact of MCI Group, as the majority shareholder, on decisions made by General Shareholders' Meeting of the Parent, may be substantially stronger than the impact of minority shareholders.
6.5 Planned Investments
The Company will focus on investments in improved warehouse service systems, further development of the IT infrastructure for warehousing and logistics purposes, necessary to ensure efficient e-trade in B2B and B2B2C areas. The Company is able to finance such investments. More detailed information is provided in point 6.1. Implementation of ABC Data S.A.'s Strategy S.A.
