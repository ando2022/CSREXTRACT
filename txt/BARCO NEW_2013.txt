LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CEO
Dear Shareholders, Customers, Partners and Employees, In 2013, while operating in a challenging global economic environment, and despite early signs of weakening demand for its digital cinema projectors, Barco staged a repeat performance of its record 2012 year. Sales increased ever so slightly to 1.158 billion, while operational profitability remained robust at 153 million. Currency translations had a noticeable impact on the reported results: in constant currency terms, sales would have been 31 million higher, and EBITDA some 6 million better. Continued focus on operational excellence enabled the company to continuously reduce its working capital needs and generate healthy operating cash flow while also absorbing two strategic acquisitions. Fueled by the solid performance of its projection division, Barco's annual sales exceeded 1 billion for the third consecutive year. The company is gradually transforming its traditional cinema-centric focus to become a broader, digital visualization solutions company.

12 Barco | annual report 2013 | Letter from Chairman and CEO
A STABLE COMPANY POSITIONED FOR PROFITABLE GROWTH Early in 2013 ­ to make Barco even more customer-centric and market driven ­ we established market divisions alongside our traditional product divisions. Responding to ever-growing demand for integrated systems with expanded functionalities, each of our market divisions now can draw on the full portfolio of Barco's capabilities to develop integrated solutions tailored to its customers' specific needs. The recent acquisitions of AWIND, JAOTech and projectiondesign®, as well as IPVS, have greatly enhanced our ability to offer end-to-end solutions ­ not just in terms of superior visualization standards, but also in terms of connectivity and user-friendly interactivity. We trust that, with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 in all of its businesses except Digital Cinema, Barco is well positioned for sustainable and profitable growth.
Herman Daems, Chairman

Barco staged a repeat performance of its record 2012 year
PROJECTION CONTINUES TO GROW DESPITE CINEMA MARKET DECLINE Barco further increased its market share in a softening cinema market with a capture rate of about 50% and confirmed its leadership with major roll-out deals in Latin America, China and India. Coupled with an exclusive partnership for projection with IMAX, Barco remains the de facto standard for cinema projection.
Building on our reputation for superior technology, we have been actively expanding our product offering to build further on our `cinema of the future' concept. Thanks to an exclusive deal with DreamWorks Animation, we already have 250 reference installations for the Auro 11.1 immersive 3D sound technology worldwide. Further diversification includes the introduction of smaller footprint projectors, and we are also readying our laser projection offering to capitalize on the ROI and light output benefits of this technology.
The acquisition of Norway-based projectiondesign® proved to be successful. We are making good progress with the integration and are gearing up their products, channels, and know-how to realize Barco's comeback in the professional AV market. Barco's high-end 3-chip DLP® product range was complemented with mid-range 1-chip DLP® projectors ­ resulting in one of the widest portfolios in the market and providing an answer to any projection need. The launch of the `Connect' partner program ­ at our first-ever global partner conference in Malta ­ clearly shows our commitment to this market segment, and helped us double sales in this segment year-on-year. In venues & hospitality as well, Barco holds a strong position and leads in offering high lumens projection for the experience economy.

HEALTHCARE: NEW SEGMENTS FUELING GROWTH BEYOND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING Barco kept its dominant market position in diagnostic imaging with the introduction of a complete portfolio of LED displays ­ an achievement that was honored with the Frost & Sullivan 2013 product line strategy award. Although the diagnostic imaging segment is a mature one, it will remain an important revenue contributor for the division, with a healthy replacement cycle in digitized markets in Western Europe and North America and significant growth potential in the BRIC countries.
While maintaining leadership in diagnostic imaging, the Healthcare division continued its investment strategy in new market segments. Operating theaters are a prime source of revenue for today's healthcare organizations, and the investments we've made for the digital operating room are starting to yield results with reference deals, first partnerships, and installations in Europe and North America.
Orders picked up in the hospital IT segment in Q4, as healthcare enterprises increasingly invest in patient care and clinical workflow solutions. To further accelerate market penetration, Barco secured a partnership with a leading software provider in the UK to offer customers a full solution that encompasses both terminals and software for interactive patient care.
RECONFIGURING ADVANCED VISUALIZATION Year-on-year sales in the Advanced Visualization division declined by more than 10%. Volumes remained stable in terms of number of units shipped, but the gradual shift in the market's mid-segment to cheaper, lower-margin LCD video walls is impacting revenue and profitability.
In addition to a number of specific cost-reduction programs, and in response to the challenging market conditions, we strengthened our focus on the traffic & transportation and security & surveillance segments and started to renew and diversify our product portfolio to meet market demand for collaborative visualization and decision-making. In a world full

of sensors, cameras and other data streams, integrated and networked systems are key enablers for our customers in monitoring their businessor life-critical applications. Operators in the field need to be connected to headquarters in real-time so that they and their managers always have all details available to take complex decisions in a split second. With more than 1000 sites worldwide using digital networked video-wall solutions in 2013, Barco reconfirmed its technological leadership position for control rooms.
At the same time, we have been preparing to complement our product portfolio and to further diversify with competitive video-wall solutions, tiled near-seamless LCD video walls, graphics controller portfolio and software, and even cloud-enabled technologies. This approach allows us to further penetrate the mid-segment and grow beyond visualization and video walls to offer customer-integrated systems for collaborative decision-making.
PROFITABILITY RESTORED IN DEFENSE & AEROSPACE ACTIVITIES In the first half of 2013, Defense was impacted negatively by the sequestration in the US and budget restrictions on government spending worldwide, which led to reduced order volumes. Avionics, on the other hand, did well ­ and Barco cockpit displays were among those selected for integration into the first-ever Chinese commercial airliner.
In the first half of the year, we took decisive restructuring measures for our Defense & Aerospace division. Actions were aimed at streamlining the business, helping the business optimize its product portfolio, responding to market opportunities in emerging markets, and (in the US) strengthening the focus on key accounts. Thanks to this approach, we managed to bring the division back to profitability. With a good recovery in order intake at the end of the year, we are confident about our prospects in this business.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Letter from Chairman and CEO 15
Thinking from the customer instead of from the product, we have to grow Barco beyond visualization into networking and collaboration

REAPING THE BENEFITS OF OUR VENTURE APPROACH When we implemented the venture structure three years ago, we wanted some of our (new) businesses to embrace a more entrepreneurial spirit and introduce new technologies or revamp the portfolio without the burden of a corporate organization.
That approach has proven to be successful. The ClickShare venture brought breakthrough collaboration technology to the meeting room and has already shipped more than 12,000 units worldwide. LiveDots ­ our LED venture ­ successfully repositioned its product portfolio and can now proudly boast landmark installations in top locations in cities like Paris, New York, Johannesburg and London. In addition, High End Systems ­ our digital lighting venture ­ managed to recover from unfriendly market conditions and has made a comeback in the rental & staging industry.
All ventures are now profitable and have proven their added value. ClickShare has already been gradually integrated into the Barco structure, and High End Systems will be. We intend to decide about the future of the other ventures in the course of 2014.
BEYOND VISUALIZATION ­ INTO NETWORKING AND COLLABORATION The acquisitions of projectiondesign® and AWIND have helped us expand our commercial reach and technology portfolio in line with our vision `to provide best-in-class networked visualization solutions that enable our customers to run their businesses more effectively'.
This entails `thinking from the customer instead of from the product' ­ and, based on this customer intimacy and market knowledge, we have to grow Barco beyond visualization into networking and collaboration. Projection and display technologies will remain a core element of our business proposition, but they will be complemented with hardware and software solutions that enable the distribution of images and data streams to support collaboration within and beyond facilities.

For Barco, this means supplementing our display portfolio with software-enabled solutions, exploring new business models that complement the current CAPEX-based approach, adding cloud and multimedia technologies to our offering, and moving from products to solutions and systems.
80 YEARS OF TRANSFORMATION Barco will celebrate its 80th Anniversary in 2014 ­ and we are looking to the future with confidence.
In the last few years, we moved forward on our strategy to prepare the company for the next growth stage: moving beyond visualization into networking and collaboration. We are committed to following this course and to creating sustainable value with all businesses in the markets we serve.
To further drive this transformation and realize the company's full potential, the Board reserves most of the company's financial resources for future growth investments. By raising our dividend to 1.50 per share, we want to express our gratitude to our shareholders as we continue to transform the company along the paths of profitable growth.

OUR VALUES
Trust is the fundamental pillar in any relationship, whether it is at home or at work. Without trust, you simply cannot win. Many acquisitions fail due to lack of trust. When Barco acquired projectiondesign, we wondered: would this be a hostile takeover or a friendly one? After all, we had been competitors until then.
Happily, our joining of forces soon appeared to be a beneficial move for all of us. Barco and projectiondesign share the same drive and values, and it was clear that Barco wanted to take everyone to the next level ­ together. The first seeds of trust were sown, nourishing our willingness to fully collaborate and participate in what was, to us, an undefined adventure.
Trust is the very heartbeat of a winning company
Throughout the entire integration process, Barco encouraged cultural diversity and ­ motivated by our joint ambition to move the company forward as one team ­ even changed its own habits and processes. Not only did this create reassurance and trust among colleagues, it also led to trust and encouragement among partners.
Earned and built over time, trust is the very heartbeat of a winning company. Only in the climate of trust are people willing to strive for the slightly impossible, to take initiative, to feel accountable, and to take decisions on their own and work effectively. I think we have come a long way in this process, and I truly believe that we can accomplish great things together.

14 years in project management have taught me that keeping your customers happy is about doing more than what is expected of you. That's how we delight our customers, instead of merely satisfying them. Customer delight is about providing unexpected extras by fostering open communication, anticipating needs, and building relationships.
I believe building interpersonal relationships with customers, internal or external, is the single most differentiating factor between customer satisfaction and customer delight. At the end of the day, customers do business with people they like and understand. That's why values such as integrity, accountability, trust, and mutual respect are the cornerstone of our code of conduct.
Interpersonal relationships make the difference between customer satisfaction and customer delight
Meeting and exceeding customer expectations requires energy and hard work. At Barco, we make sure that everyone ­ back office and front office ­ is close to the customer. Regular touch points, such as customer visits and testimonials, give us insight into what's at stake and fuel relationships.
Every day, we convince people that customer delight is everyone's job. Our Customer Delight test, through which each employee receives a Customer Delight score and immediate action points for improving his/her customer focus, is just one of the tools to make customer delight part of our DNA.

We care about our people, including colleagues, customers, suppliers, and society in general. A respect for each other's well-being is a major priority for us. Because people determine the success of our organization and make our company thrive.
Our culture of appreciation is reflected in every way we deal with people. Employees are guided on their career path, and strong relationships are built through online communities, buddy programs for new employees, and company events. Fun initiatives ­ such as the Day of the Barco Engineer and Happy Compliment Day ­ are significant drivers of this culture.
Our approach builds trust and engages hearts
We involve customers and suppliers in the decisions we make. With mutual respect and their best interests at heart, we move our business forward in a sustainable manner. Our corporate social responsibility task force and the Supplier Sustainability Program are just two of the efforts that reflect our willingness to go the extra mile.
Our approach builds trust and engages hearts, and translates into actions that serve the entire community. Our people take the lead in charity projects, both internal and external, and show their commitment to the company and the causes we support, time and again.

6. Sustainable solid state illumination We are gradually phasing out traditional CCFL and Xenon lamps in our product designs and are replacing them by solid state lighting to save energy and reduce environmental waste.

ONE CAMPUS: A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
One Campus opens new windows of opportunity in terms of environmental sustainability. Its technical infrastructure will be evaluated based on environmental performance. The new building will feature "free cooling" units and solar panels, and energy monitoring will help optimize the efficient use of energy.

OUR VALUES
For us, open and ethical conduct means: ensuring a safe and enjoyable working environment, complying with laws, regulations and policies, and operating in a transparent and socially responsible manner. Every day, we put this philosophy into practice, conducting our business in accordance with the highest standards of ethical behavior.
Because ethical conduct is a joint responsibility, our ethical values have been translated into a formal code of conduct: the `Barco Code of Ethics and Business Conduct' offers employees ­ as well as suppliers, partners, and customers ­ a framework for understanding and acting on our shared responsibilities.
When it comes to ethical and transparent behavior, we all walk
the talk
In our team, openness and transparency toward customers and co-workers are crucial. In roadmap discussions, we consider the needs of the market while touching base with R&D, procurement, and strategic marketing. We are always open to debate, never hold back information, and communicate and share our vision for every decision that is made.
This is true for everyone at the company, regardless of position and level of responsibility. The strategy roadshows are a great example of how management is able to get the whole organization to work toward a joint objective through open communication. When it comes to ethical and transparent behavior, we all walk the talk.

What key trends are driving your business? From movie theaters to museums, today it's all about the visitor experience. Additionally, infrastructure investments in the emerging regions are triggering demand for innovative visualization solutions. This is also true for enterprises and corporate organizations, where `bring your own device' and remote working policies are changing the corporate landscape.
What will the entertainment & corporate business be like moving forward from here? In entertainment, we will maintain our focus on capturing market share in the emerging countries and lower-end segments, as we also extend our share of wallet beyond projectors ­ by, for example, offering a dedicated services portfolio. For venues and hospitality, we will strengthen our focus on the fixed installations market (in addition to the rental & staging markets) to drive visitor experiences. However, our biggest opportunities lie in corporate AV.
What will be the main focus in terms of capabilities and technology? Solid-state illumination, networking capabilities that enable visual collaboration, and the development of best-in-class, hassle-free, immersive solutions will be our core activities.

MARKET TRENDS [01]

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE (AND ROI)

With big-screen TVs present in almost every home, quick theater-to-DVD turnarounds, and video-on-demand providing inexpensive movies right in your living room, the cinema industry needs to step up its game fast. The cinema of the future is no longer about movies alone. Instead, moviegoers expect a premium entertainment experience from entrance to exit.
New innovations and technologies ­ such as high frame rates for increased image quality, 4K resolution, 3D sound and video, and laser projection ­ help create a premium immersive experience and are driving the industry forward. 3D ticket sales, for example, have proven to drive high revenue. However, today's movie theaters are operating at just 20% occupancy, which means the industry is eager to find ways to fill the 80% of unused capacity.

Theaters worldwide have already been expanding from feature-film only to alternative content, such as live streaming of opera or sports events. But the real game-changers will be provided by digital signage (in the lobby and corridors or on facades) and smart interactive cinema (by pushing content to smartphones, for example) to provide visitors with a truly immersive cinema experience.
The venues and hospitality industries are also shifting towards this so-called `experience economy'. Museums, houses of worship, planetariums, and shopping malls are incorporating interactive and creative technologies to engage with their audiences. Creating unique, memorable, and personal experiences will be key in drawing visitors and guests back, time and again.

A CLOSER LOOK
LASER BEHIND THE SCENES
Laser illumination is a logical next step in maximizing the opportunities of digital in the `cinema of the future'. The impact of laser on the cinema industry could be bigger than that of any other technology introduction so far! We unveiled our 55,000 lumens 4K prototype laser projector to the public for the first time in January 2012. But where does it go from here?
Right now ­ via product development, setting up framework agreements with suppliers, testing and certification ­ we are developing the prototype into a real finished product. We cannot give away all of our secrets ­ but we do commit to delivering a product that meets and exceeds the requirements of cinema exhibition.
By continually pushing the boundaries in product design, the laser projector is bound to redefine the industry standard once it has been perfected. What you can do with it, how you can use it, the maintenance required over its lifetime ­ all will be a significant improvement on what exhibitors are used to now.

MARKET TRENDS [02]
BRIC NATIONS TAKE THE LEAD
Because the digital cinema projector market is nearing saturation in North America and Western Europe, growth is being driven mainly by strong demand in the emerging markets. To attract a growing middle class in these markets ­ as well as Hollywood and Western European movie distributors ­ traditional cinemas are converting to digital projection, and investments in ambitious multiplex projects are on the rise. Additionally, world-class sporting events are increasingly being staged in the BRIC nations ­ e.g. the FIFA World Cup 2014 and the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil, the World Cup 2018 in Russia, the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India, and the 2008 Olympics in China ­ which is triggering new infrastructure investments and growing demand for media, entertainment, and AV solutions in these emerging markets.
Auro 11.1 takes over the Indian cinema industry with installations in Manasa Theatre (Bangalore), Dhanya Theatre (Kollam), and `Tollywood' (Suresh Productions and Ramanaidu Studios).

MARKET TRENDS [03]
THE CORPORATE FUTURE IS MOBILE AND INTERACTIVE
Enterprise mobility continues to grow worldwide. According to our `Meeting room of the future' survey, which we jointly organized with InAVate and PFM magazine, 91% of business managers work remotely on a regular basis, with 27% working remotely almost daily. When attending a meeting, 82% bring their own device (the majority of these are laptops, but other mobile devices are on the rise).
The future is mobile ­ and, as increasing numbers of employees are working remotely, meeting spaces must become more flexible and support a greater range of technologies and demands for virtual conferencing. Today's changing work environment requires new visualization and collaboration technologies that improve efficiency and productivity in meeting rooms, board rooms, and auditoriums.

survey.

With ClickShare for wireless presentation at the click of a button, we significantly improved meeting dynamics and reduced setup times. But because there are big differences between the needs of small, standard meeting rooms and those of high-profile meeting rooms, boardrooms and conference rooms, we now offer ClickShare in two flavors: the new CSM Base Unit and the original full-featured CSC Base Unit.

OUR VALUES
Accountability is one of the fundamentals of a successful organization. As business professionals, it's our responsibility to be accountable to our colleagues and customers. By taking full ownership of tasks, actions, and results, and by continuously challenging and evaluating ourselves, we help our company thrive.
As part of the sales team, customers are my greatest responsibility. The whole team focuses on a core set of KPIs, such as on-time delivery and customer satisfaction, as we constantly look for new ways to improve customer focus. Some of my colleagues are now `divisional experts' ­ providing specific product- or procedure-related support ­ so that we can find the best solution for our customers.
We take ownership both individually and collectively
But more than that, accountability is key throughout our entire company culture. We take ownership both individually and collectively. People are proud of being part of the Barco family ­ and this pride drives them to find ways to take the company forward, even if it requires extra personal effort.
From product managers diversifying the product portfolio so that we can reach multiple markets to sales administrators developing their skills in the Six Sigma tools, everyone of us meets challenges with a positive attitude. And we all know that a positive mind leads to positive solutions. Is there a better way to keep customers and colleagues satisfied?

MARKET TRENDS [01]

FASTER DIAGNOSES WITH FLATTENING BUDGETS

Lifestyle-linked diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc.) continue to grow globally, while an ageing population increases the level of care required by patients. By 2050, the number of patients per doctor is expected to double, driving the need for faster and more efficient diagnoses.

At the same time, healthcare spending is under scrutiny. The Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, urges the US healthcare industry to save 563 billion in the next decade. Hence, the industry needs new ways to deliver care more efficiently and more effectively.

Our entire product portfolio has been built to reduce the total cost of ownership and provide a high return on investment. As a proof point of what our solutions can do, we gladly refer to a study carried out by Deloitte and Hospedia which indicates that CareConnex for interactive patient care can help save hospitals no less than 2.8 million per year!

MARKET TRENDS [02]
PATIENTS OR MEDICAL SHOPPERS?
In a time when better quality of life is rapidly becoming a habit of life, active healthcare is shifting from institutions to individuals. Consumerization of healthcare refers to the trend of transforming patients into consumers and shifting more responsibility for care to the patient. Patients today are `medical shoppers', empowered by the Internet to actively research, assess, and rate healthcare and healthcare delivery organizations.
In the USA, for example, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey provides a standardized methodology for measuring patients' perspectives on hospital care. These scores directly impact reimbursements from healthcare insurers and give good healthcare providers a competitive edge.
With our interactive patient care solutions, we enable healthcare providers to position themselves for success. Offering a host of patient-focused services (e.g. TV, Internet, video-on-demand, and extensive patient education and feedback options), CareConnex has a significant impact on patient satisfaction, which is a valuable indicator of the quality of care delivered and can even impact hospital reimbursement.

MARKET TRENDS [03]
IP AS A COMMON BACKBONE
New trends ­ such as e-health, Electronic Medical Records, remote surgery, among others ­ are radically transforming healthcare delivery. Therefore, patient records, diagnostic information, and even the operating theater are increasingly relying on networked technologies to change the way we access and share health information.
Providing a universal IT platform, IP technology is able to link patient data from previously disconnected systems, offering medical staff a patient-centric view of health information. Facilitating access, retrieval, and sharing of patient data, this technology enables healthcare professionals worldwide to provide safer, timelier and more effective care.

We introduced a complete line of network-enabled surgical displays (MDSC) that feature an integrated IP decoder and are fully compatible with the Nexxis digital OR solution. This way, surgeons can easily distribute uncompressed video and data over the IP network, to any location, and without delay.

Over the years, we've introduced a number of firsts in many industries, including the healthcare industry: the first 10MP diagnostic display, the first seamless multi-modality display, MediCal QAWeb for online QA and asset management, and many more.
Additionally, we have developed a host of patented image-enhancing technologies to present radiologists with the best possible diagnostic image quality. With about 60 technology patents in healthcare imaging ­ over 200 Barco-wide ­ we have an astonishing legacy of technological breakthroughs.
We have an astonishing legacy of technological breakthroughs
Our most recent innovation is the LED backlights that have been designed specifically for healthcare applications. They render more JNDs (Just Noticeable Differences) to help radiologists see more shades of gray. We have also re-designed our patented uniformity technologies for the unique characteristics of LED backlit displays to make it easier to detect the smallest abnormalities.
By making subtle details more noticeable more quickly, we can reduce windowing and leveling time so that radiologists can read more studies each day ­ and, ultimately, deliver better care. It's amazing to see how you can make a difference by putting people and technology together.

OUR STRATEGIC CHOICES
3 QUESTIONS TO DAVE SCOTT
BARCO'S GENERAL MANAGER DEFENSE & AEROSPACE
What key trends are driving your business? We notice three major trends in our industry. The first is a focus on `lowest cost, technically acceptable' solutions due to government budget restraints. The second is growth in the BRICT countries where we see increased airline travel, new airports and additional defense and security needs. Finally, we see an increase in unmanned systems taking over critical jobs where danger and risks are very high.
What will the defense & aerospace business be like moving forward from here? There is a distinct shift from military to civil aerospace business so we will focus our portfolio on this area, especially for civil flight simulation as well as the civil airline industry. The principles that define the defense market will remain however, so we will continue to adapt our products to also meet the future needs of this segment.
What will be the main focus in terms of capabilities and technology? We will focus on products that are lower weight, lower cost, using multi-touch and networked technologies. These will be targeted to unmanned systems, civil simulators and avionics environments with a special regional focus on the BRICT and APAC regions.

102 Barco | annual report 2013 | Our activities
MARKET TRENDS [01]
COST IS EVERYTHING!
With budgetary pressures increasing (mainly in the US, which represents 40 - 50% of the global defense market), governments are adopting a `low price, technically acceptable' attitude in order to decrease military spending. They are selecting those products that meet the minimal requirements and come with a lower price tag, rather than their high-level, best-value counterparts.
Cost-conscious strategies are also driving the need for commercial and military aircraft to become more fuel-efficient. For most airlines, fuel costs (about 40% of operations) have surpassed labor costs as their largest expense. This is prompting the industry to implement fuel-saving practices, such as simulator-based training, the use of light-weight materials, and new flight techniques.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd. (COMAC) has selected our simulation and virtual reality training system for the day-to-day training of its aerospace engineers. This is the first simulation and virtual reality system in China's commercial aviation industry.

We introduced the FDU-2108, the lightest 12" flight display for business jet cockpits. Weighing only 2 kg, and without compromising on image quality and reliability, the FDU marks a major breakthrough in cockpit display design.

MARKET TRENDS [02]
EMERGING COUNTRIES BECOME SELF-RELIANT
Just as they seek self-sufficiency in their economy, developing countries are pursuing self-reliance in defense technology. Establishing an indigenous defense industry helps meet domestic needs and protect national security.
Needless to say, this evolution opens up opportunities. In India, for example, military spending will likely total nearly 110 million by 2017 (McKinsey). The BRIC countries and the Asia-Pacific region in particular will offer tremendous export potential for global defense industries, especially for those with a local presence.

The rise of network-centric systems and cyber defense are fueling the quick adoption of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). These remotely piloted, or self-piloted, aircraft systems can be used for military (e.g. reconnaissance & surveillance) as well as civil applications (e.g. firefighting, law enforcement, pipeline monitoring). The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of UAS in the US by 2015, and in Europe by 2016. Additionally, despite increasing budget constraints in the defense and aerospace industries, the international market for unmanned aircraft systems is expected to double to 100 billion in the next decade (according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International).
With the new HD-30 rugged display, we added new technologies to improve operator performance and comfort in mobile shelters and ground stations, from which UAS are typically operated. Minimal power consumption, noiseless operation, ultra-fast image rendering, and highly accurate Infrared technology are just a few of the differentiators.

Our Nexxis RNA adapters support uncompressed streaming of desktop content (DVI, audio, USB) over the IP network, enabling real-time interaction with remote servers or computers ­ without dedicated video switches and without sacrificing image quality!

OUR VALUES
Good team players act in the best interests of the company. They put aside differences to resolve issues and move forward for the common good. They treat colleagues with respect. And they are confident and trusting, encouraging team members to get the job done.
Team play is a crucial asset in our project deployment team. Collective effort and mutual cooperation are second nature to us. By working together as one team ­ across geographic and organizational boundaries ­ we achieve common goals and ultimately get the results we're after.
Winning as a team is one of our greatest motivators
Winning as a team is one of our greatest motivators, driving us to do things better ­ together. With the iXL program (our employee-driven improvement program), for example, we motivate colleagues worldwide to share their ideas and best practices through a dedicated online platform.
In addition to all of those aspects of team play, we collaborate on helping people grow personally as well as professionally. Last year, about one hundred of our colleagues organized and participated in the Barco Play Days, providing games and activities for children in need. That's team play reaching out to the world.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
In 2013, the Board of Directors met 7 times. One of the meetings was held in the offices of projectiondesign® in Frederikstad (Norway).
At every meeting, the Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the financial results as well as the short to mid-term financial forecast of the company.

It also deliberated on the renewal of the director's mandates as presented by the Remuneration and nomination committee. It deliberated on and subsequently approved the acquisition of AWIND. At dedicated meetings, the Board, in close concert with the core leadership team, reflected on each of the divisions' and ventures' strategies for the short to mid-term and approved the 2014 financial budget.

At regular intervals, the Board has reviewed the company's structure against its long term strategy, evaluated possible acquisition opportunities presented by the strategic committee, examined the divestment of assets deemed no longer strategic. The Board closely monitored the implementation of strategic projects such as the consolidation of the company's activities in Kortrijk on one campus or the implementation of one common ERP-system.

122 Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The audit committee meets at least twice a year with the statutory auditor and the head of internal audit to consult with them about matters falling under the power of the audit committee and about any matters arising from the audit. The CEO and CFO also attend the meetings of the audit committee, unless the members of the audit committee wish to meet separately. The audit committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the: » Risk management and internal control arrangements » Reliability and integrity of the Group's financial statements and
periodical and occasional reporting » Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as well as the
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct » Performance, qualifications and independence of the external
auditors » Performance of the internal audit function.
In 2013, the audit committee convened five times. The Chairman of the audit committee reported the outcome of each meeting to the Board of Directors. The yearly report of the activities of the audit committee, including the audit committee's self-assessment, has been submitted to the Board of Directors.
The statutory auditor attended three meetings during which it reported on the results of its audit procedures and highlighted specific attention points. The statutory auditor's management letter contained no recommendations for material adjustments.
The audit committee reviewed the Group's overall risk areas and risk management and control procedures related to the following areas: legal & compliance risks, IT risks, currency and treasury instrument risks, health, safety and environmental risks, internal control risks and insurance program.
Each quarter, the financial reports are discussed, with special attention to the critical accounting judgments and uncertainties, consistent application of valuation rules and off balance sheet obligations. The audit committee meeting of December is dedicated to the preparation of the year-end closing, with a particular focus on the review of the impairment testing procedures performed on goodwill and on capitalized development cost.

REMUNERATION AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration and nomination committee meets at least two times per year, as well as whenever changes are necessary in the composition of the Board of Directors, be they appointments or reappointments. The committee is aware of the importance of diversity in the composition of the Board of Directors in general, and of gender diversity in particular. The committee takes this into account whenever new directors need to be appointed. In this respect, the Board is in the process of identifying potential candidates for future nominations given the upcoming membership renewals. The CEO participates in the meetings when the remuneration and nomination plan proposed by the CEO for members of the core leadership team is discussed, but not when his own remuneration is being decided.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the remuneration and nomination committee has access to all resources that it deems appropriate, including external advice.
In 2013, the remuneration & nomination committee met 3 times.
The remuneration & nomination committee has reviewed the remuneration of the senior leadership team and the CEO. This included the definition and evaluation of bonus criteria, bonus deferral principles as well as an overall assessment of composition and positioning of the reward packages based on external data. This was done with regard to the 2013 bonus review as well as the 2013 salary review and bonus plans. In preparation for the general meeting, the committee prepared and reviewed the remuneration report. The nomination of new Board members and the performance as well as succession of the senior leadership team were also on the agenda. In 2013 the Chairman of the remuneration and nomination committee conducted individual interviews with key leaders in Barco supporting the strategy for 2014 and beyond.
With regard to the stock option plan 2013, the committee took the opportunity to investigate different equity-based reward practices and the characteristics of the stock option plan before approving and submitting it for Board approval. Upon the CEO's recommendation, the committee approved the grants for the senior leadership team and the principles for eligibility of Barco employees. The grant for the CEO was proposed and reviewed by the committee in preparation for Board approval.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report 123

STRATEGIC COMMITTEE
The Board of Directors has set up a strategic committee, including the Chairman and the CEO. The Chairman presides over this strategic committee. Members of the executive management and other members can be invited to attend meetings of the strategic committee. The committee meets when an issue is introduced by the CEO. The committee meets at least one time per year to evaluate the existing strategy.
Upon the proposal of the CEO, the strategic committee discusses options that could influence the company's strategic path. Possible topics that may be discussed in this committee include acquisitions, mergers and the sale of a given activity. Other important strategic choices can also be discussed in the committee, such as investing in new technologies, markets or regions that could have an important impact on the future of the company. This relates to investments running over a number of years that involve a minimum engagement by the company of 10 million euro over the entire duration of the project.
In 2013, the strategic committee met 2 times.

The executive management presented a selected number of proposals for acquisitions. The strategic committee conducted in-depth discussions about the strategic value of the proposed transactions in view of the company's long-term strategy. The committee also evaluated the opportunities as well as the risk profiles of the projects and gave appropriate instructions regarding the transaction parameters.

EVALUATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES

The Board of Directors regularly carries out a process of self-evaluation. The intention is to evaluate the functioning of the Board as a whole and of its committees. In this respect individual and private interviews are held with each of the directors, leading to a report which is submitted to the full Board for review and action. The topics discussed are: the quality of the interaction between management and the Board, the quality of the information and documents submitted to the Board, the preparation of the Board meetings, the quality of the discussions and decision-making of the Board, the extent to which all relevant strategic, organizational and managerial issues are addressed by the Board, and the contribution of all Board members to the decision-making process at the Board. This process

allows for actions to be taken, aiming at the continuous improvement of the governance of the company. Moreover, prior to a director's (re-) appointment, the remuneration & nomination committee discusses and evaluates the individual director's contribution to the Board.
The above is fully in line with the Corporate Governance Code. Reference is also made to Title 1 (1.3) of the company's Corporate Governance Charter on www.barco.com/investors/corporategovernance.

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES REWARD REVIEW PROCESS
Barco wants to be an attractive company for top talent in the technology market space, based on sustainable human resources practices. Competitive reward, together with career and development opportunities, is at the heart of Barco's employee value proposition. Overall, Barco strives for a position above the market median on the total reward proposition, with a substantial variable part based on company, team and individual performance.
2013 variable payment was based on company (40%), divisional/functional (30%) and individual performance (30%).
The reward packages of the senior executive and extended management teams are reviewed by the remuneration and nomination committee on an annual basis. The committee assesses overall market competitiveness (based on bi-annual external market data), individual market positioning and sustained individual performance. This review results in updated individual reward packages and reward policies, as well as the criteria for the annual Barco Bonus plan. The 2013 variable payment is based on EBIT, free cash flow, costs, orders, sales and individual targets. If the target variable part of the compensation of individual members of the executive management should exceed the 25% threshold on total compensation, the deferral will be based on sustained profitability.
REMUNERATION PACKAGE 2013 OF THE CEO
» fixed gross salary of 645,750 euro. » 2013 variable remuneration of 650,000 euro. The target variable
part is above 25% of total compensation and as a result, in line with the Law on Corporate Governance, 50% of this amount will be deferred (25% in 2014 and 25% in 2015) and is subject to sustained profitability. » deferred 2011 variable remuneration of 198,900 euro in line with the deferral conditions. » Deferred 2012 variable remuneration of 204,750 euro in line with the deferral conditions.

» contribution for retirement benefits of 300,000 euro. » other components of the remuneration: 24,248 euro.

In 2013, 25,000 stock options were granted to the CEO. 15,000 warrants/ stock options were exercised and no warrants/stock options lapsed. Since stock option grants are based on neither individual nor company performance, these are not to be considered variable remuneration as defined by the Law on Corporate Governance.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
BASIC PRINCIPLES » Art. 523 of the Companies Code sets the rules for conflicts of interest
that may arise within the context of a director's mandate. » Each board member sees to it that these rules are strictly observed » Any act or transaction which may potentially give rise to a conflict of
interest is carefully scutinized to avoid that such conflict may arise. » In 2013, none of the directors reported any conflict of interest as
referred to in article 523 of the Companies Code.
FUNCTIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST
A director who is a director or business manager of a customer or supplier or who is employed by a customer or supplier shall report this fact to the Board of Directors prior to the deliberations concerning a topic on the agenda relating (whether directly or indirectly) to this customer or supplier. This obligation also applies when a family member of the director is in the above-mentioned position.
The same rule applies when a director or his or her family members (whether directly or indirectly) hold more than 5% of the shares with voting rights of a customer or supplier.
Subsequently, the director in question: » shall leave the meeting while this topic on the agenda is being dealt
with; » shall not be permitted to participate in the deliberations and
decision-making about the topic in question.
These provisions are not applicable when the customer or supplier is a listed company and the participation of the director (or his or her family members) takes place within the framework of assets that have been placed under the management of an asset manager who manages these assets in accordance with his own judgment, without taking the director (or his or her family members) into account.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL PROCESSES
INTRODUCTION
Barco operates a risk management and control framework in accordance with the Companies Law Code and the Corporate Governance Code 2009. Barco is exposed to a wide variety of risks within the context of its business operations that can result in the objectives being affected or not achieved. Controlling those risks is a core task of the Board of Directors, the core leadership team and all other employees with managerial responsibilities. The risk management and control system has been set up to reach the following goals: » Achievement of the company objectives » Operational excellence » Correct and timely financial reporting » Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
The principles of the COSO reference framework and the ISO 31000 risk management standard have served as a source of inspiration to Barco in the set up of its risk management and control system.

CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
Barco strives for an overall compliance and a risk-awareness attitude by defining clear roles and responsibilities in all relevant domains. This way, the company fosters an environment in which its business objectives and strategies are pursued in a controlled manner. This environment is created through the implementation of different companywide policies and procedures such as: » The code of ethics and business conduct » Decision and Signature Authority Rules » The Barco values » The quality management system » Risk profiling, reporting and mitigation processes The core leadership team fully endorses these initiatives. The employees are regularly informed and trained on these subjects in order to develop sufficient risk management and control at all levels and in all areas of the organization. The Risk and Compliance Manager is in charge of the overall coordination of the risk management and control process.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY All employees are accountable for the timely identification and qualitative assessment of the risks (and significant changes to them) within their area of responsibility.
Within the different key, management, assurance, and supporting processes, the risks associated with the business are identified, analyzed, pre-evaluated and challenged by internal and external assessments.

Likelihood

BEFORE IMPACT

Negligible Minimal Serious Critical Destructive

Frequent Probably Possible Unlikely Rarely

RECOVERY

In addition to these integrated risk reviews, periodic assessments are performed to check whether proper risk review and control measures are in place and to discover unidentified or unreported risks. This process is driven by the risk and compliance manager. The risks are further evaluated to set the right prioritization by allocating them in a consistent manner to an impact scale on the one hand, and a likelihood scale on the other hand. The scale for impact and likelihood are based on the acceptable level of risk exposure that is determined by the Board of Directors. All risks are recorded in the risk register of the related process with a specification of their impact and likelihood. In addition, each risk is allocated to a risk owner who is responsible for setting up and implementing the mitigation action plan and the monitoring and follow-up of his/her risk. On a corporate level, the risk matrix is drawn up based on the risk score (impact x likelihood), whereby risks are classified as `Unacceptable risk', `Risk under observation' or `Acceptable risk'.
`Unacceptable risks' are contained by means of an action plan to minimize the effects of such risks on the organization's ability to achieve its objectives. Also, the risks `under observation' are monitored by a member of the core leadership team.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report 129

These processes are facilitated by the risk and compliance manager by: » Providing tools and training to identify, analyze, evaluate, report,
escalate and mitigate risks, » Raising overall awareness of risk management, compliance and
control within the company, » Encouraging continuous improvement. All risks are specified in the Barco risk universe, which can be divided into five categories: » Strategic risks: macro-economic risks, acquisitions, co-operation with
strategic partners and technology and market dynamics. » Operational risks: concentrating and specialization, capacity
constraints, transport and storage, key components, and single sources, new product development, know-how and qualified personnel, health and safety of people, and information and communication technologies. » Financial risks: the risks connected to the accounting and financial reporting, currency and interest fluctuations, liquidity, loans and capital, bankruptcy of customers and partners, forecast and planning. » Legal and compliance: ethics and business conduct, liability, government regulations, product compliance, intellectual property and contract management. » Force Majeure risks are grouped in a site-related and a humanrelated risk domain.
MOST IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS Barco has identified and analyzed its corporate risks. While this list is not exhaustive, Barco specifically recognizes that the following risks deserve attention:
Strategic risks Acquisition risks Part of Barco's long-term growth strategy is based on acquisitions. Despite the fact that Barco has well-defined parameters for potential acquisitions and carries out due-diligence processes with the utmost care, acquisitions always entail risks. These risks may be associated with the integration of the acquired company into the group. The growth of the acquired business may be slower than forecast, or the acquired technological knowledge may not be as valuable as anticipated. These risks may result in impaired goodwill.

Macro-economic risks Beyond Barco's immediate business environment, an overall negative economic climate, a lack of liquidity in the financial markets, or a global stock market collapse may have a negative effect on Barco, its customers and its partners. A recession may slow Barco's customers and partners down or render them unable to secure the funds for planned investments. To mitigate its own risks in terms of liquidity, Barco increased its committed credit facilities to 115 million in December 2011 and continued to focus on a pro-active cash generating strategy. These committed credit facilities have recently been extended in tenor and have been increased with another 50 million, leading to total available committed credit lines of 165 million per 31 December 2013, which are for the biggest part undrawn. On the other hand, the fact that Barco conducts business in a variety of markets and geographical regions may reduce the impact of bad economic conditions, as they may not affect all markets and regions equally.
Operational risks Risks related to new products Barco is active in very specialized, selected professional markets for visualization technologies. In order to maintain, or attain, market-leader status in each of its key markets, the company annually invests considerably in research & development. In 2013, this investment amounted to 95.5 million, or 8.2% of sales. With regard to the selected professional markets, the company's main challenge is to define the right products to introduce into each market. Risks associated with this challenge are: » not being the first to market a new product, which may lead to
smaller market share than anticipated or even to discontinuation of the product. » using third-party components that do not meet the expected quality levels, resulting in unusually high (or higher than anticipated/ provisioned) warranty expenses. » not achieving the expected sales volume or profitability, due to lack of competiveness. » New technologies such as networked connectivity and wireless presentation. » introducing new products that are not yet ready to be marketed, resulting in unusually high (or higher than anticipated/provisioned) warranty expenses.

The continuous improvement of the New Product Introduction (NPI) program is driven by the green and the red teams and is supported by several competence groups. In 2013, two of the objectives were: » performing better requirements & risk management » empowering the NPI project managers

SCOPE

Key components Expected sales volumes may not be achieved due to a shortage of components. This shortage may be a global phenomenon, due to an economic crisis or a major natural disaster. It may, however, also be linked to the introduction of new products that require new components, which may not yet be available in the required volumes. Key components sourced by a single source receive dedicated follow-up with mandatory high management attention.

Supplier Evaluation

Barco's global procurement team tracks suppliers closely to anticipate potential disruptions. By reducing its supplier database, Barco seeks to build a more collaborative relationship with its suppliers to Barco's advantage.
IT risks Barco makes extensive use of IT systems and platforms to support its operations. As configuration, hardware or software failures may occur, which can hamper these operations, proper fail-safe and recovery procedures are in place to mitigate these risks.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report 131

In addressing safety risks inherent to any modern IT infrastructure, Barco's facility and IT management is fully compliant with ITAR and C-TPAT guidelines, proactively scans its network for vulnerabilities, strictly regulates access to its networks, and regularly performs disaster recovery exercises. Barco is in the process of implementing a new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system and selected SAP ECC as its main platform. In combination with this, Barco also wants to lift its processes to a higher level. The implementation of ERP systems has been a challenge for many organizations in the past. Therefore, Barco is continuously identifying the risks and setting proper controls during the new ERP implementation. By controlling and minimizing the major business risks in the first instance, the scene can be set for a successful implementation of the new ERP system.
Financial risks The risks measures related to the accounting and financial reporting risks are described in the `Barco consolidated' section.
Legal and compliance risks Compliance and governmental regulations In a company of Barco's size and scope, an employee's actions can result in a breach of laws and regulations or company ethics. Any resulting criminal prosecution or fine can of course have a negative effect on the company's image, business and share value. This risk is higher in emerging markets, as the knowledge of local laws and regulations, or the monitoring of ethical standards, may still be less developed than in more mature markets.
Compliance rules affect each employee in his or her daily work. All associates exert effort to comply with legal, corporate and local Barco policies and procedures and to strive together towards a truly compliant organization based on Barco's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. The Legal, Risk and Compliance department assists in ensuring compliance by collecting and sharing the knowledge of functional, regional and divisional compliance owners supported by local Legal & Compliance Managers. The compliance management system and the Barco compliance overview guide the organization through the complex web of rules and regulations.

Force majeure risks Events of an exceptional nature (such as a fire) may affect the company itself, or events on a larger scale (such as flooding, earthquake or extreme weather conditions) may affect component suppliers. These kinds of events, which can also include terrorist attacks or disease epidemics (Human related force majeure risks), can destabilize part or all of the world's economy. Especially in the case of an R&D and/or a manufacturing site (Site related force majeure risks), those events may seriously affect the company's competitive position, as they may disrupt deliveries to customers or postpone new product releases. Barco has set up an international insurance program with reputable underwriters to cover both its assets and loss of income in case of business interruption due to such exceptional events. The coverage as well as the insured amounts are reviewed regularly and benchmarked with the assistance of professional insurance brokers. Nevertheless, it is impossible to calculate beforehand what the negative impact of such events might actually be.

132 Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report

CONTROL ACTIVITIES Control measures are in place to minimize the effect of risk on Barco's ability to achieve its objectives. These control activities are embedded in the company's key processes and systems to assure that the risk responses and the company's overall objectives are carried out as designed. Control activities are conducted throughout the organization, at all levels and all departments. The Risk and Compliance Manager supports the adoption of clear processes and procedures for a wide range of business operations related to compliance and export control. The Risk and Compliance Manager reports on his activities to the core leadership team and to the audit committee. In addition to these control activities, an insurance program is being implemented for selected risk categories that cannot be absorbed without material effect on the company's balance sheet.
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
Timely, complete and accurate information flow ­ both top-down as well as bottom-up ­ is a cornerstone of effective risk management. In operational domains, Barco has implemented a management control and reporting system (MCRS) to support efficient management and reporting of business transactions and risks. This system enables Barco's management to capture relevant information on particular areas of business operations at regular time intervals. The process enforces clear assignment of roles and responsibilities, thus ensuring consistent communication to all stakeholders regarding external and internal changes or risks impacting their areas of responsibility. In addition to the MCRS, the company has put several measures in place to assure security of confidential information and to provide a communication channel for employees to report any (suspected) violations of laws, regulations, company policies or ethical values.

MONITORING OF CONTROL MECHANISMS
Monitoring helps to ensure that internal control continues to operate effectively.
The continuity and the quality of Barco's risk management and control framework is assessed by the following actors: » Internal Audit. The tasks and responsibilities assigned to Internal
Audit are recorded in the Internal Audit Charter, which has been approved by the audit committee and the Board of Directors. The key mission of Internal Audit as defined in the Internal Audit Charter is "to add value to the organization by applying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating the internal control system and providing recommendations to improve it." » External auditor, in the context of its review of the annual accounts. » Compliance Officer, within the framework of the company's Corporate Governance Charter. » Risk and Compliance Manager, who plays a pivotal role in the organization by ensuring appropriate coordination and follow-up of risk items. » Audit committee: the Board of Directors and the audit committee have ultimate responsibility with respect to internal control and risk management. (See also the `Board committees' section in this annual report.)

STATUTORY AUDITOR

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
The accurate and consistent application of accounting rules throughout the company is assured by means of Finance and Accounting Manuals, which are available for the key accounting sections. Specifically within the financial domain, a quarterly, bottom-up risk analysis is conducted to identify and document the current risk factors. Action plans are defined for all key risks. The results of this analysis are discussed with the statutory auditor. The accounting teams are responsible for producing the accounting figures (closing bookings, reconciliations, etc.), whereas the controlling teams check the validity of these figures. These audits include coherence tests by comparison with historical and budget figures, as well as sample checks of transactions according to their materiality. All material areas of the financial statements concerning critical accounting judgments and uncertainties are periodically reported to the audit committee. Specific internal control activities with respect to financial reporting are in place, including the use of a periodic closing and reporting checklist. This checklist assures clear communication of timelines, completeness of tasks, and clear assignment of responsibilities. Specific identification procedures for financial risks are in place to assure the completeness of financial accruals. Uniform reporting of financial information throughout the organization ensures a consistent flow of information, which allows the detection of potential anomalies. An external financial calendar is planned in consultation with the Board and the core leadership team, and this calendar is announced to the external stakeholders. The objective of this external financial reporting is to provide Barco's stakeholders with the information necessary for making sound business decisions.

At the annual shareholders meeting of 26 April 2012, Ernst & Young Bedrijfsrevisoren BCVBA, De Kleetlaan 2, 1831 Brussels, was re-appointed as statutory auditor of the company for a period of 3 years. Given the retirement of Mr. Jan De Luyck in 2013, Ernst & Young Bedrijfsrevisoren BCVBA is now represented by Mrs. Lieve Cornelis and Mr. Marnix Van Dooren.
In 2013, remuneration paid to the statutory auditor for auditing activities amounted to 475,355 euro. Remuneration paid to the statutory auditor for special assignments was 10,917 euro.

COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS

Barco advanced its strategy to move beyond Digital Cinema. While maintaining its market leadership in Digital Cinema, Barco positioned the company to penetrate the corporate AV segment. The addition of projectiondesign® contributed to profitable growth of 9% for the Projection division.
Barco also saw increasing momentum in order intake from new market segments, notably Digital Surgery, Patient Care and ClickShare. This illustrates the traction the company is gaining in executing its strategy to capture share in new and mid segment markets.
However, Advanced Visualization experienced competitive pressures in the mid segment in addition to ongoing soft demand for control room solutions. After introducing new mid segment solutions, orders began to rebound during the fourth quarter.
A continued focus on operational performance and excellence enabled Barco to maintain profitability and generate strong cash flow while absorbing two strategic acquisitions. EBITDA performance for the year was in line with 2012 reflecting the combination of a strengthening gross margin and improved cost discipline across the board that compensated for the acquisition-related increase in operating expenses.

Unfavorable foreign currency effects prevented Barco from achieving its goal of delivering another year of profitable growth. In constant currency, sales grew 3% or 31 million euro and our EBITDA was approaching 160 million euro.
In terms of profitability, the strategic acquisitions weighed on 2013 EBIT and net earnings. Separately, the improvements Barco made in operational profitability in Healthcare and Defense & Aerospace resulted in a 13.7% EBITDA margin for the second half of the year. In the short term the company will continue to implement a number of cost down programs and adjust selected operating expenses.
As Barco reaps the benefits of operational excellence and gains further traction with is growth initiatives, the company remains committed to delivering sustainable profitable growth.
DIVIDEND AND SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM The Board will propose to the general assembly to increase the dividend from 1.40 euro per share paid in 2013 to 1.50 euro per share to be paid out in 2014. It remains Barco's objective to generate consistent dividend growth for the shareholders.
The Board will also propose the authorization to initiate a share buyback program within the statutory limits.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2013
Preliminary remark The results of the China Joint Venture and of projectiondesign® have been fully consolidated as of 1 January 2013; the results of AWIND have been consolidated as of 1 April 2013.

ORDER INTAKE AND ORDER BOOK
Order intake was 1,150.5 million euro, up 1.5% as Healthcare and Defense & Aerospace registered strong gains while Projection and Advanced Visualization were essentially flat. By geography, strong growth in APAC was offset by softness in the EMEALA region and to a lesser extent North America.
For the year, order intake was roughly equivalent to sales. However, the relationship between order intake and sales was different in the two semesters. For 1H13, sales exceeded orders by 38 million euro; for

2H13, the trend reversed and orders exceeded sales by 34 million euro. By comparison, for 2H12, orders were lagging sales by 34 million euro. The order book recovered in the second semester to 460.9 million euro, after dipping in the first semester, to a level that was comparable to the second semester of 2012.

PROFITABILITY
Gross profit Gross profit increased 2.9% to 386.5 million euro from 375.6 million euro. As a result the gross profit margin improved further to 33.4%, compared to 32.5% in 2012.

Operational expenses Total indirect expenses represent 27% of sales and increased 10.2% from 24% of sales in 2012 and 2011. This increase is largely due to the addition of projectiondesign® and AWIND with a higher indirect cost structure and strengthened by associated amortization of intangibles.
Research & Development expenses increased 10.2 million euro to 107.5 million euro, reflecting new product development projects in the Advanced Visualization division, the addition of projectiondesign® and amortization of technology acquired from projectiondesign® and AWIND. As a percent of sales, research and development expenses increased to

9.3% from 8.4% last year. Sales & Marketing expenses increased 18.5 million euro to 160.7 million euro compared to 142.2 million euro last year, in large part due to the above-mentioned acquisitions. As a percent of sales, Sales & Marketing expenses rose to 13.9%, compared to 12.3% last year. General & administration expenses were 55.7 million euro, compared to 52.2 million euro last year or 4.8% of sales versus 4.5% last year.
Other operating results amounted to 4.4 million euro, compared to 3.0 million euro last year.

EBITDA & EBIT
EBITDA was 153.2 million euro, a decrease of 6.2 million euro compared to 159.5 million euro the year before. EBITDA margin was 13.2% versus 13.8% in 2012. EBITDA margin improved in 2H13 to a 13.7% level, compared to a 12.8% for 1H13. Barco's operational profit margin remained healthy considering the company made important investments to its growth, including acquisitions, and incurred costs related to those acquisitions. EBIT before restructuring was 79.0 million euro or 6.8%, compared to 100.2 million euro or 8.7% in 2012. The decline in EBIT in comparison to EBITDA is due to increased amortizations as follows: »» Higher amortization of capitalized development costs in the amount
of 7 million euro »» Higher amortization of intangibles booked in connection with the recent
acquisitions in accordance with IFRS-guidelines (Knowhow/Technology, Customer lists and Trade names) in the amount of 5.8 million euro
As a result the gap between EBITDA margin and EBIT margin versus sales widened from 5.1ppts of sales in 2012 to 6.4ppts in 2013.
The company will continue to record amortization on knowhow/technology and customer list in 2014; Trade names (1.2 million euro) and costs related to the inventory step-up & retention bonus (3.8 million euro) were fully amortized & absorbed in 2013.

INCOME TAXES
In 2013 taxes were 8.1 million euro, for a tax rate of 12.0%, compared to 5.0 million euro in 2012, or a tax rate of 5.0%.
NET INCOME
Net income for the year was 59.4 million euro, including 9.4 million euro in charges, consisting of a non-recurring restructuring charge and an impairment charge, that were booked in connection with actions taken to right size selected operations primarily in the Defense & Aerospace and Advanced Visualization divisions. These non-recurring charges in combination with an increased tax-rate resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to equity holders compared to last year.
Net earnings per ordinary share (EPS) for the year were 4.86 euro, down from 7.84 euro in 2012. Fully diluted net earnings per share were 4.71 euro, compared to 7.50 euro last year.

142 Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report

Barco ended 2013 with a net financial cash position of 104.4 million euro, compared to 24.2 million euro on 30 June 2013 and 111.2 million euro on 31 December 2012.
Over 2013, changes in trade receivables were 25.8 million euro positive, while changes in inventory were 29.3 million euro offset by negative changes in trade payables for an amount of 29.9 million euro. Other changes in working capital for 9.7 million euro include advances on customer projects and increase in other liabilities.
At the end of 2013, trade receivables were 177.5 million euro, 5.6 million lower than than 31 December 2012. DSO were at 52 days, compared to 57 days as of 30 June 2013 and 48 days as of 31 December 2012.
At 211.6 million euro inventory was 12.1 million euro lower than on 31 December 2012 and 39.8 million euro lower than on June 2013. Inventory turns were at 3.2, compared to 3.0, at the end of June 2013 and 3.1 at the end of December 2012.
Trade payables stood at 114.1 million euro at the end of December 2013,

compared to 118.4 million euro at the end of June 2013 and compared to 127.5 million euro at the end of December 2012.
Goodwill increased to 145.7 million euro on 31 December 2013 from 68.8 million on 31 December 2012. The increase in goodwill was driven by the acquisitions of projectiondesign® and AWIND.
Other intangible assets increased from 25.0 million euro on 31 December 2012 to 55.2 million euro while non-current liabilities increased from 25.9 million euro on 31 December 2012 to 67.5 million euro. Other intangible assets increased due to fair value adjustments (according to IFRS) on the acquisitions and due to the investments in the new ERP package SAP (other intangible assets under construction). Non-current liabilities increased from 25.9 million euro on 31 December 2012 to 67.5 million euro mainly due to a financial leasing related to the acquisition of projectiondesign® and a draw down on Barco's credit facility from the European Investment Bank.
Capital expenditure, excluding capitalized development, was 22.9 million euro, compared to 24.9 million euro for the same period last year.

ROCE (after Tax) stood at 15%, compared to 16% at 30 June 2013 and 24% at 31 December 2012. The decrease reflects the impact of acquisitions on goodwill and intangibles and the higher effective tax rate of 12.0% compared to 5.0% last year.

REMARK ON BARCO'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 2014 Effective 1 January 2014, Barco took steps to sharpen the organization's focus on markets by promoting the product and solution portfolios of all businesses and cross selling throughout the company.
To emphasize the market focus, the Projection and the Advanced Visualization divisions have been renamed and the venture High End Systems has been integrated into the core. For details about the new organizational structure please go to the description of our business areas on page 26 For the analysis of the 2013 results the composition and the naming of the divisions remain unchanged.

PROJECTION DIVISION
Sales and order intake in the projection division continued to shift in favor of Professional AV as a result of the addition of projectiondesign® during fiscal 2013. For the year, Professional AV accounted for 30% of sales versus 25% last year and 35% of order intake versus 25% last year.
Within Digital Cinema, Barco reached a capture rate of 50% and further expanded its market share with program wins and roll-outs in Latin America, China and India. With more than 40,000 digital cinema projectors delivered over the last 6 years, Barco is market leader and is well positioned to reap the benefits of a large installed base with service and

maintenance-contracts and future upgrade and replacement programs. In the Professional AV segment, Barco successfully implemented its plans to integrate projectiondesign® and the company is on track to align projectiondesign®'s profitability with Barco's financial targets for the Projection division by optimizing manufacturing and supply chain operations, and sales and marketing resources. Barco continued to penetrate the mid venue and corporate projection segments, extending its global network and launching 11 new projectors during the second semester, and is now well positioned to drive growth in this market.

»» Digital Cinema's top line was flat in a softening market compared to 2012 while Professional AV posted strong sales increases mainly in the Corporate AV segment, due to the addition of projectiondesign®. Sales in the EMEALA and APAC region were up offset by slower sales in North America.

»» EBITDA margin, while still solid at 16%, was lower than 2012 reflecting the addition of projectiondesign®. In 2H13 the good progress projectiondesign® made to lift its profitability was partially offset by increased spending on R&D and Sales & marketing to support the Corporate AV market.

HEALTHCARE DIVISION
Barco began to realize the benefits of its strategic investments in new market segments including digital surgery, patient care and dentistry. In the second semester order intake increased by 21.0% compared to 2H12 and gross profit margin improved. As a result, the division met its EBITDA margin performance target for 2H13.
At the same time, the company maintained its leadership position in diagnostic imaging and modality, despite a somewhat weaker demand in the EMEALA region in the second and third quarters.

» Order intake rebounded in the fourth quarter with strong contributions evenly divided between the traditional and new market segments. North America delivered most of the growth while the other regions remained a flat performance in order intake.

» Sales declined modestly driven by softness for the second and third quarters. Flat or weaker performances in the Traditional diagnostic and the modality markets were flat while the new segments started to generate sales.

» EBITDA increased as a result of gross profit margin improvements, cost down programs and a more favorable product mix.

146 Barco | annual report 2013 | Directors' report

ADVANCED VISUALIZATION DIVISION
The Advanced Visualization division posted lower sales for the year. Development of solutions for the mid segment took longer than anticipated, control room projects were delayed and demand from customers in Europe was soft. With the introduction of solutions for the mid segment in the second semester, order intake improved towards the end of the year. As a result of lower sales and higher R&D expenses, EBITDA declined year over year.

Cost down programs on the videowall cubes & LCD-solutions and operating cost reduction programs are both ongoing. These programs are expected to position the division for restored profit contribution in 2014.
Sales of ClickShare steadily increased each quarter. Since launching ClickShare in the fourth quarter of 2012, Barco has been certified to sell ClickShare in more than 60 countries worldwide and has sold over 12,500 units while adding new partners and channels.

»» Gross profit margin remained fairly stable while the combination of lower sales and increased spending on networked and collaboration solutions and higher sales and marketing expenses caused EBITDA to decline both in absolute terms and as a percent of sales.

DEFENSE & AEROSPACE DIVISION
Growth in avionics during 2013 was overshadowed by the ongoing reduction in defense spending worldwide which led to project delays and cancellations. However, demand among defense customers improved during the second semester with new and delayed business starting to kick-in. As a result, Barco signed new frame agreements, saw order intake increase and ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05.

OUTLOOK FOR 2014
The following statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially.
For 2014, Barco anticipates that the macro-economic environment will remain challenging and that currency translations may have a significant effect on reported results. Nevertheless, the company expects to generate sales growth albeit in low single digits. The combination of strategic growth initiatives, cost reductions and spending control is expected to result in improved profitability.
While executing on the strategic priorities, management also plans to strengthen its global competitive positioning through continued focus on

operational excellence, and to make decisions regarding Barco's portfolio of venture companies and to execute on its plan to deploy financial resources to support growth initiatives in Barco's core activities.
The Board will propose to the general assembly to extend the mandate of Eric Van Zele in order to ensure continuity of the company's strategic direction and to build on the strong track record of Barco's current executive team in realizing the company's strategic objectives.

EVOLUTION OF THE SHARE PRICE

The Barco share price closed at 56.70 on 31 December 2013 ­ 2.2% higher than the closing price of 54.50 the year before.
On the back of a strong track record and good performances, closing and average prices have returned to pre-financial-crisis levels: the average closing price is at its highest level since 2007, and the closing price on 31 December is the best since 2006.
This evolution pushed the market capitalization of the company to around 700 million. Overall, analyst expectations varied during the year between 60 and 70, to close the year with a consensus target price of 62.
Over the last few years, Barco's share volatility has been typically higher than that of the indexes, reflected in higher price variations versus the market. In 2013, however ­ and despite some very specific spike effects ­ volatility decreased compared to previous years, with the lowest absolute and relative variance gap (between lowest & highest share price) in 8 years.
Liquidity of the share has again improved for the second year in a row ­ with approximately 10% more volume traded on Euronext, and a similar increase on the alternative platforms.
The full year performance of the share for 2013 was rather soft. Major indices ­ such as the CAC40 (+18%) and the BEL20 (+18%) ­ booked impressive gains, while Barco's share won 2.2% over the full year. However, the behavior of the stock price in 2013 was rather atypical and contrary to the major indices, with a much stronger performance in the first half of the year, a downward correction in the summer, and a comparable performance over the last 4 months of the year.
In the first three months of the year, the share price rose strongly (+25%), reaching a peak of 69.60 on 15 March, followed by a fairly stable period for the full first semester. Concerns about the impact of the anticipated slowdown of the digital cinema market as of Q3 started to have an effect from July onward, resulting in a steep decline on 1 and 2 July, which pushed the share price back to the level of the beginning of the year.
After a short upward correction following the quite good results of the

first half, the share price slipped down again in August (to a level around 53 - 55), and then started a new, more moderate, rise toward 61 following the analyst and investor day. The Q3 results ­ announcing a slightly weaker sales performance against a challenging comparison base ­ triggered a hefty day ("sell on the news"), which resulted in an exceptional trading volume (more than 200,000 shares traded) and a -9% hit. Subsequently, the share price hovered between 53 and 55 in the fourth quarter, and then finally closed the year on a positive note at 56.70.
Since July 2013, some first shorters were registered on the Barco share. A first US fund went short on the share in August and moved out again in October, after which a London-based fund developed a short position of 1.5% by the end of October ­ a position that they still had by the end of the year.
The increased liquidity of the share reflects continued interest in the market. Barco started the year with a buy recommendation across the board, supported by listings in a number of preference lists. By the end of the first half, and after the peak performance at about 69, the share was removed from most preference lists and was downgraded by a number of brokers.
Despite a very decent performance in the first half of 2013, the investment community remained somewhat concerned about Barco's resilience against a slowdown in the cinema market and the impact that would have on the earnings. The general trend is acknowledgement of Barco's strategy as being the right way forward, with concern regarding the timing of the outcomes of the growth initiatives.
Between the end of 2008 (with a closing price of 17.90) and the end of 2013 (with a closing price of 56.70), the Barco share realized a 215% increase in value ­ a perfect illustration of the positive impact of the turn-around strategy kicked off in 2009 and the company's positive performance track record.
Barco thanks its shareholders for their continued confidence in the company, its board of directors, its management and its employees, as the company progresses on its path of sustainable growth.

INVESTOR RELATIONS
A study of Barco's global shareholdership at 31 December 2013* identified ownership of almost 90% of the company, with identified institutional investors holding 64% of all shares, 5.5% being treasury shares held by the company and 24% held by retail investors.
2013 IN RETROSPECT 2013 was a tale of two halves for Barco ­ with weaker Q3 sales arresting the strong performance of the projection division in the first half. In the first six months of the year, substantial upside was registered on Barco's share, with entries of both growth and value investors. From July onwards, analyst perception started to turn, and the flat guidance given in the release of 3Q earnings caused a sell-off with shares slumping by 8.8% in the last 6 months.
In the first six months of the year, Barco seems to have mirrored the market trend, with an early market rally offset by pullback driven by profit taking, softer macro data, and the potential for US fiscal stimulus withdrawals. In the first quarter, the share rose by 25% ­ outperforming the market ­ and then softened in 2Q to land at around 60 for the first semester, which was still a good 12% rise. There was good turnover in this period, with 6 new firms entering the Top 10 buyers. In this first semester, Barco's share was attractive for growth-oriented firms and with an attractive valuation to appeal to value investors as well. Good inflows were noted from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Following this strong first-half performance, Barco's investment case took a hit in the second half of the year ­ triggered by analysts downgrading their recommendation and strengthening the profit-taking trend. Weaker Q3 sales and flat EBITDA guidance prompted a sell-off across institutional investors and an 8.8% drag on share price performance over the full semester. Substantial outflows occurred in Germany and the United States in the second half, offset by inflows from Belgium (through GIMV), the Nordic region (with Norges bank), London, Switzerland and New York.

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION At the end of the year, 34% of the institutional shares were owned in North America (United States & Canada), down from around 40% a year before. 33% were owned in Belgium (up from 30% in 2012), 13% were owned in the UK (down from 8% the year before), and 6% in France (flat year-on-year). The remaining shares are owned in the rest of Europe: Germany, Switzerland, the Nordic regions, and the Netherlands.
Over the year, positions rose in the UK, Belgium and the rest of Europe. Shareholdership was stable for the United States but fell for Canada, France and Germany.
BARCO'S INVESTMENT CASE Although the second-half evolution impacted the presence of growth investors, Barco's investment case became more appealing to valueoriented investors. The stock remains a good value play, residing in the top 20% of underpriced securities globally. Margin growth resulting from reducing cost and restructuring measures and a contingency of the downside risk could fuel upside.
In addition, Barco's dividend yield can also prove to be fair compensation for shares, which may underperform in the near term.
Value investors have taken 35% of the shareholder base (coming from 33% last year), while the combination of growth- and GARP-investors has declined from 22% at end 2012 to 19% at the end of 2013. GARP investors hold 16% of the institutionally owned shares (up from 15% at end 2012).

CONCENTRATION We welcomed 4 newcomers to the Top 10 holders over the year.
Share price concentration went down in the first six months of the year, and then rebounded to the level of end 2012. The Top 10, Top 25 and Top 50 represent 38%, 51% and 59% of the free float, respectively. Compared to the Mid Cap client benchmark, Barco is below average in terms of shareholder concentration, which should result in less share price volatility if a top investor decides to divest. A majority of Barco's institutional shares are held by investors classified as `low turnover' (expected holding periods exceeding 24 months), which should also prove to be a stabilizing factor.
There is selected exposure to hedge funds: One US fund in Q3 was replaced by a London-based hedge fund in Q4 and is still holding the position.
STRATEGY 2013 - 2014 Despite a challenging macro-economic environment, and the abovementioned shift from growth to a more value-oriented investment case, Barco continued its investor relations efforts in roadshows, conference calls and company visits with regular visits to the tier 1 cities such as London, New York, Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt, while exploring and maintaining other geographies as well.
We organized another successful and well-attended Analyst & Investor Day in September 2013, kicked-off the consensus-gathering with institutional research analysts, and released the first shareholder guide.
For 2014, we intend to advance this strategy to reach out to the worldwide IR community through roadshows, conference calls and company visits and to extend and strengthen the portfolio of IR-related material. This includes upgrading the investor relations website and the release of new or updated IR-related deliverables such as a fact sheet, consensus and research reports, and the shareholder guide.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of this income statement.

(a) Translation exposure gives rise to non-cash exchange gains/losses. Examples are foreign equity and other long-term investments abroad. These long-term investments give rise to periodic translation gains/losses that are non-cash in nature until the investment is realized or liquidated. The comprehensive income line commonly shows a positive result in case the foreign currency in countries where investments were made appreciates versus the euro, and a negative result in case the foreign currency depreciates. In 2013, the negative exchange differences in the comprehensive income line were mainly booked on foreign operations held in Indian Rupee, US Dollar and Norwegian Krone.

SIGNIFICANT IFRS ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

1. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
1.1. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements of the Barco group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted for use in the EU. All standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) effective year-end 2013 and adopted by the European Union are applied by Barco.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euro and are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative financial instruments. The financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 4 February 2014. The chairman has the power to amend the financial statements until the shareholders' meeting of 24 April 2014.
1.2. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
General The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company, Barco nv, and its controlled subsidiaries, after the elimination of all intercompany transactions.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent obtains control until the date control ceases. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Control exists when Barco has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared according to the parent's company reporting schedule, using consistent accounting policies.
Non-controlling Interests Non-controlling Interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the group and are presented separately in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from shareholder's equity.

Investments in associated companies Investments in associated companies over which the company has significant influence (typically those that are 20-50% owned) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are carried in the balance sheet at the lower of the equity method amount and the recoverable amount, and the pro rata share of income (loss) of associated companies is included in income.
Joint ventures The company's interest in jointly controlled entities is recognized using the equity method, which involves recognizing a proportionate share of the joint ventures on the face of its income statement. The investment is presented as non-current asset on the face of the balance sheet.
2. GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associated company at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for development costs, which relate to the design and testing of new or improved materials, products or technologies, which are capitalized to the extent that it is expected that such assets will generate future economic benefits and the recognition criteria of IFRS are met. Capitalized development costs are amortized on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives. General estimate of useful life is 2 years, unless a longer or shorter period can be justified. This period is not exceeding 4 years.
4. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalized at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at fair value separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and are amortized over their economic life time. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis not exceeding 7 years.

166 Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated

5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Generally, depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance sheet date to assess whether they are recorded in excess of their recoverable amounts, and where carrying values exceed this estimated recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amount.

Estimated useful life is:

- buildings20 years

- installations10 years

- production machinery

5 years

- measurement equipment

4 years

- tools and models

3 years

- furniture10 years

- office equipment

5 years

- computer equipment

3 years

- vehicles

5 years

- demo material

1 to 3 years

- leasehold improvements and finance leases: cfr underlying asset,

limited to outstanding period of lease contract

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognized.

6. LEASES Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the group substantially all risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized as property, plant and equipment at the fair value of the leased property, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long-term or current liabilities depending on the period in which they are due. Lease interest is charged to the income statement as a financial cost using the effective interest method. Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.

Operating leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership over the lease term, are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are expressed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
7. INVESTMENTS Investments are treated as financial assets available for sale and are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition costs associated with the investment. For investments quoted in an active market, the quoted market price is the best measure of fair value. For investments not quoted in an active market, the carrying amount is the historical cost, if a reliable estimate of the fair value cannot be made. An impairment loss is recorded when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.
8. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Other non-current assets include long-term interest-bearing receivables and cash guarantees. Such long-term receivables are accounted for as loans and receivables originated by the company and are carried at amortized cost. An impairment loss is recorded when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.
9. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs of completing the sale. In addition to the cost of materials and direct labor, the relevant proportion of production overhead is included in the inventory values.
10. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured. For product sales, revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer. Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is probable. For revenue out of projects, the percentage of completion method is used, provided that the outcome of the project can be assessed with reasonable certainty. These projects generally have a lifetime of less than one year. For sales of services, revenue is recognized by reference to the stage of completion.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated 167

11. GOVERNMENT GRANTS Government grants related to development projects, for which costs are capitalized, are classified as deferred income and recognized as income in proportion to the depreciation of the underlying fixed assets. Government grants related to research projects and other forms of government assistance are recognized as income upon irreversible achievement and by reference to the relevant expenses incurred.
12. TRADE DEBTORS AND OTHER AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE Trade debtors and other amounts receivable are shown on the balance sheet at nominal value (in general, the original amount invoiced) less an allowance for doubtful debts. Such an allowance is recorded in operating income when it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due. Allowances are calculated on an individual basis, and on a portfolio basis for groups of receivables that are not individually identified as impaired. The calculation of the allowances is based on an aging analysis of the trade debtors.
13. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with banks and short-term investments with an original maturity date or notice period of three months or less. It is the group's policy to hold investments to maturity. All investments are initially recognized at fair value, which is the cost at recognition date. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the investments are redeemed or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
14. PROVISIONS Provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made to the amount of the obligation.
The group recognizes the estimated liability to repair or replace products still under warranty at the balance sheet date. The provision is calculated based on historical experience of the level of repairs and replacements.
A provision for restructuring is only recognized when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly before the balance sheet date.

15. EQUITY ­ COSTS OF AN EQUITY TRANSACTION The transaction costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit.
16. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loan/borrowing. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are stated at fair value, which is the cost at recognition date.
18. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Employee benefits are recognized as an expense when the group consumes the economic benefit arising from service provided by an employee in exchange for employee benefits, and as a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange for employee benefits to be paid in the future. General pension plans are defined contribution plans. Obligations for these plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement as incurred. Pension obligations caused by legal requirements and some exceptional cases where the additional pension plan includes defined benefit obligations, are treated as post employment benefits of a defined benefit type.
19. TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of transaction or at the end of the month before the date of the transaction. At the end of the accounting period the unsettled balances on foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at the rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the accounting period. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
20. FOREIGN GROUP COMPANIES In the consolidated accounts all items in the profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the average exchange rates for the accounting period. The balance sheets of foreign group companies are translated into euro at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end. The resulting exchange differences are classified in a separate component of `other comprehensive income', until disposal of the investment.

168 Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated

21. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration given (in the case of an asset) or received (in the case of a liability) for it. Transaction costs are considered in the initial measurement of all financial assets and liabilities. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. The fair values of derivative interest contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their market price at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments that are either hedging instruments that are not designated or do not qualify as hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in the income statement.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognized directly in `other comprehensive income' with the ineffective part recognized directly in profit and loss.
22. INCOME TAXES Current taxes are based on the results of the group companies and are calculated according to local tax rules. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Tax rates used are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and tax losses can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.

Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
23. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For other tangible and intangible assets, at each balance sheet date, an assessment is made as to whether any indication exists that assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an impairment test is carried out in order to determine if and to what extent a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the asset to its value in use (the present value of estimated future cash flows) or, if higher, to its fair value less cost to sell. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction less the costs to sell while value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the assets belong. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Reversal of impairment losses recognized in prior years is included as income when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognized for the asset are no longer needed or the need has decreased, except for impairment losses on goodwill, which are never reversed.
24. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT Barco created warrants for staff and non-executive directors as well as for individuals who play an important role for the company. According to the publication of IFRS2, the cost of share-based payment transactions is reflected in the income statement. The warrants are valued at grant date, based on the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, dividend estimates, and interest rates. Warrant cost is taken into result on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the first exercise date.
25. EARNINGS PER SHARE The group calculates both basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per share. Under IAS 33, basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of warrants outstanding during the period.

As diluted earnings per share can not be higher than basic earnings per share, diluted earnings per share are kept equal to basic earnings per share in case of negative net earnings.
26. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE A discontinued operation is a component of the group that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The group classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the group measures the carrying amount of the asset (or all the assets and liabilities in the disposal group) in accordance with applicable IFRSs. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are recognized at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell.

IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED AS FROM 2013

Several amendments apply for the first time in 2013. However they do not impact the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group. The nature and the impact of each of the following new standards, amendments and/or interpretations are described below:
» IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income ­ Amendments to IAS 1
» IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements » IAS 12 Income Taxes ­ Recovery of Tax Assets » IAS 19 Employee Benefits (amended) » IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities - Amendments to IFRS 7 » IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement » IFRIC 12 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine » Annual Improvements to IFRS (Issued May 2012)
IAS 1 PRESENTATION OF ITEMS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ­ AMENDMENTS TO IAS 1 The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI). Items that could be reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point in time (e.g. net gain on hedge of net investment, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, net movement on cash flow hedges and net loss or gain on availablefor-sale financial assets) now have to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified (e.g. actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans and revaluation of land and buildings). The amendment affected presentation only and had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance.
IAS 19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (REVISED 2011) (IAS 19R) IAS 19R includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that are now recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and permanently excluded from profit and loss; expected returns on plan assets that are no longer recognized in profit or loss, instead, there is a requirement to recognize interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, and; unvested past service costs are now recognized in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the related restructuring or termination costs are recognized. Other amendments include new disclosures, such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures.

In case of the Group, the transition to IAS 19R had no material impact on the net defined benefit plan obligations.
IFRS 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DISCLOSURES - OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES - AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 7 The amendment requires an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off financial instruments and related arrangements (e.g., collateral agreements). The disclosures would provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entity's financial position. The new disclosures are required for all recognized financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32. The disclosures also apply to recognized financial instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether the financial instruments are set off in accordance with IAS 32. As the Group is not setting off financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 and does not have relevant offsetting arrangements, the amendment does not have an impact on the Group.
IFRS 13 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when fair value is required to be used, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 defined fair value as an exit price. Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined. Fair value hierarchy is provided in Note 20.
IFRIC 20 STRIPPING COSTS IN THE PRODUCTION PHASE OF A SURFACE MINE IFRIC 20 applies to waste removal (stripping) costs incurred in surface mining activity, during the production phase of the mine. The interpretation addresses the accounting for the benefit from the stripping activity. This interpretation did not have an impact on the Group's financial position and performance. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated 171

IMPROVEMENTS TO IFRSS (ISSUED MAY 2012) In May 2012, the IASB issued the 2009-2011 cycle improvements to its standards and interpretations, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. When the adoption of an improvement is deemed to have an impact on the financial statements or the performance of the Group, its impact is described below:
»» IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendments clarify the difference between voluntary additional comparative information and the minimum required comparative information. An entity must include comparative information in the related notes to the financial statements when it voluntary provides comparative information beyond the minimum required comparative period. The amendments also clarify that the opening statement of financial position (as at 1 January 2012 in the case of the Group), presented as a result of retrospective restatement or reclassification of items in financial statements, does not have to be accompanied by comparative information in the related notes. As a result, the Group has not included comparative information in respect of the opening statement of financial position as at 1 January 2012. The amendments affect presentation only and disclosure only, and have no impact on the Group's financial position of performance.
»» IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: The amendment clarifies that major spare parts and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are not inventory. The amendments did not have impact on the Group's financial position.
»» IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation: The amendment clarifies that income taxes arising from distributions to equity holders are accounted for in accordance with IAS 12. The amendment removes existing income tax requirements from IAS 32 and requires entities to apply the requirements in IAS 12 to any income tax arising from distributions to equity holders. This improvement did not have an impact on the Group's financial position.

IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EFFECTIVE AS FROM 2014 ONWARDS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS We refer to the chapter `Risk factors' for an overview of the risks affecting businesses of the Barco Group
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY »» Deferred tax assets are recognized for the carry-forward of unused
tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized. In making its judgment, management takes into account elements such as longterm business strategy and tax planning opportunities (see note 12 `Deferred tax assets ­ deferred tax liabilities').
»» Impairment of goodwill: the Group tests the goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired (see note 9 .'Goodwill').

»» Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalization of costs is based on management's judgment that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalized management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.
»» Impairment of development costs: Barco tests the capitalized development for impairment if there are indications that capitalized development might be impaired (see note 10. `Capitalized development costs').

The total acquisition cost includes the amount paid at closing of 9.6 million euro and a deferred consideration of 1 million euro, payable early 2014. The contract further provides for additional earn-out payments. The earn-out payments depend on the cumulative gross margin generated for the financial years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2014. There are no minimum or maximum earn-out payments stipulated in the contract. Total earn-out payments of 3 million euro were at moment of acquisition assumed to be probable and are therefore added to the acquisition cost. There have been no earn-out payments made per 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013. The requirements for the earn-out cannot be met anymore and therefore the 3 million euro assumed earn-out payable has been taken in other operating income in 2013. See note 3.d. The goodwill recognized at acquisition is related to the `surprix' Barco was willing to pay because of the commercial and operational synergies expected to be achieved from integrating JAOtech into the Healthcare division and is not tax deductable.
In 2012, JAOTech contributed 9.7 million euro to the total turnover of the group and contributed negative 2.1 million euro to the total profit before taxes of the group.

2. OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION

2.1. BASIS OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION

Effective 1 January 2013, Barco changed the composition of three divisions as follows:

Barco's business activities:

Barco's ventures:

»» Projection (former Entertainment division adding acquisition of projectiondesign): designs and manufactures a broad family of projectors, LED displays and image processing products for use at events, concerts, open-air festival stages, retail stores, sports stadiums, museums, auditoria, meeting rooms and movie theaters.
»» Advanced Visualization (former Control Rooms and Simulation division adding two venture group companies dZine and Clickshare): offers a complete portfolio of high-quality video wall modules in a wide range of sizes and resolutions. In addition, Advanced Visualization has a strong focus on dedicated collaboration software, professional services and smart networked solutions.
»» Healthcare: has a solid reputation for delivering dependable visualization solutions that are central to the provision of quality healthcare. The product offering includes leading-edge displays for radiology, mammography, surgery, dentistry, pathology and modality imaging, along with DICOM compliant review displays, networked digital OR systems, and point-of-care devices.
»» Defense and Aerospace: provides high-performance display systems, large-screen visualization platforms, advanced processing modules and network-client applications, all ensuring continuous information availability in harsh environmental conditions. The training business, previously included in Control Rooms and Simulation, has been added to the Defense and Aerospace division.

»» Barco Silex: active in high level electronic engineering. »» High End Systems: specialized in professional entertainment lighting
products. »» LiveDots: offers high-performance LED display solutions for indoor and
outdoor installations. »» Orthogon: develops software components for the Air Traffic Control
market.
Management (Core Leadership Team is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker) monitors the results of each of the core divisions and the ventures as 5 divisions separately so as to make decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Division performance is evaluated based on EBITDA. Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to the operating divisions.
As a consequence, the group aligned its segment reporting with this business structure, resulting in 5 operating segments. The 2012 financials have been restated for comparison reasons.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
We refer to p62 for more explanation on the activities performed by each division.

2.8 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Management directs sales of the Group based on the regions to which the goods are shipped or the services are rendered and has three reportable regions Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America (EMEALA), North America (NA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC).
We refer to the `Comments on the results' on p134 for a split of revenue from external customers based on the geographical location of the customers to whom the invoice is issued. There is no significant (i.e. representing more than 10% of the Group's revenue) concentration of Barco's revenues with one customer.
Sales to Belgium represent 38.4 million euro of the Group revenues in 2013 versus 43.7 million 2012.
Barco has no customers which represent more than 10% of total turnover of the group.
Below table gives an overview of the assets per region and the most important capital expenditures in non-current assets per region:

Indirect costs represent 27% of sales in 2013 versus 24% of sales in 2012 and 23% of sales in 2011. The higher indirect costs in 2013 are affected by the new acquisitions done in 2013, which had on the one hand a higher indirect cost structure than Barco and on the other hand have led to higher amortizations on intangibles (result of fair value adjustments), included in the indirect costs. Excluding the amortizations on intangibles, indirect costs represent 26% of sales in 2013 versus 24% in 2012 and 2011. Right sizing actions in the new acquired entities were undertaken. Barco has also announced a formal restructuring plan in order to lower indirect costs again to alevel in line with corporate objectives.

In order to sustain our technological leadership, Barco strongly invests in R&D, new technologies, and innovation. We refer to `Our strategy' for more details.
Research and development cash expenses represent 9.3% of sales in 2013 compared to 8.4% of sales in 2012 and 8.0% in 2011. In 2013, the higher development expenses have led to higher capitalization (58% of total research and development expenses in 2013, 58% in 2012, 56% in 2011) compared to amortization expenses, which had a positive impact on the income from operations (EBIT) of 12 million euro (compared to a positive impact of the 13.2 million euro in 2012 and 8.7 million euro in 2011).

192 Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated

The increase in the research and development cash expenses are impacted by the acquisitions performed in 2013, which have led to higher amortizations on intangibles (result from the fair value adjustments) for a total amount of 5.1 million euro. Excluding this impact research and development cash expenses represent 8.8% of sales in 2013. Note that the line `Amortization capitalized development expenses' only include the amortization charges on own development projects. The amortization on acquired technology is included in the line `Research & Development expenses'.
Impairment costs on capitalized development expenses are presented on the line "Research and development expenses". For more explanation on impairment costs on capitalized development we refer to note 10.

Sales and marketing expenses include all indirect costs related to the sales and customer service organization which are not billed as part of a product or service to the customer as well as the costs related to regional or divisional marketing activities.
The higher sales and marketing expenses were partly caused by the new acquisitions done in 2013, which had on the one hand higher indirect sales and marketing expenses than Barco and on the other hand have led to higher amortizations on intangibles (caused by fair value adjustments) for an amount of 4.2 million euro, included in the sales and marketing expenses. Excluding the amortizations on intangibles sales and marketing expenses represent 13.5% of sales.

(a) Spread taxation on capital expenditure and research and development costs of prior years (b) See note 12 (c) The PID is applicable in Barco NV as of fiscal year 2010. The deduction in the consolidated figures is only included as from 2011 upon obtaining the
formal approval from the tax authorities. (d) In 2012, the CTA impact on Barco Manufacturing SRO has been taken in income in the consolidated figures when the related company was liqui-
dated, but is non taxable for tax purposes. (e) Notional interest deduction in 2013 and 2012 only relates to the amounts which can be offset by the current year taxable result. (f) Transfer price adjustment as a result of a transfer pricing audit in Belgium whereby a shift of results was performed from the US to Belgium. This has
been agreed upon by the US tax authorities through a mutual agreement procedure concluded end of 2013. The income has been taxed in Belgium in previous years through adjustment of the tax loss carry forwards. The income recognized in Barco NV (Belgium) this year is therefore tax exempt.

(a) In 2013 and 2011, investments include entities in which Barco owns less than 20% of the shares. In 2012, investments included, on top of entities in which Barco owns less than 20%, the acquisition of 61% of the shares of projectiondesign for an amount of 33.4 million euro, which took place 19 December 2012. The effective control was only transferred on 1 January 2013.
(b) In 2011, the Group had a 50% interest in Barco Toyo Medical Systems Japan Co, a jointly controlled entity which was part of the Healthcare division and a 58% interest in CFG Barco (Beijing) Electronics Co., LTD, a jointly controlled entity which was part of the Projection division. In 2012, Barco acquired the remaining 50% interest in Barco Toyo Medical Systems Japan Co. The acquisition cost was limited (about 50 thousand euros). After the acquisition, Barco Toyo has been merged with Barco Co, Ltd. The interest in joint ventures in 2012 therefore only includes the 58% interest in CFG Barco (Beijing) Electronics Co., LTD. Effective as of 1 January 2013, the contract with Barco's joint venture partner China Film Group has been modified, resulting in Barco obtaining control over CFG Barco (Beijing) Electronics Co, Ltd. Barco's ownership in the company of 58% remained unchanged and no additional consideration was paid for the change in control. As a result of obtaining control CFG Barco has been fully consolidated as from 1 January 2013 onwards.

In 2013, the Group has obtained a 42% interest in Habornveien 53, AS, through the acquisition of projectiondesign, which is part of the Projection division.
The Group's share of the assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011 and income and expenses of the jointly controlled entities and associates for the year ended 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011, which are accounted for using the equity method:

Acquisitions in 2013 include goodwill related to the acquisition of projectiondesign for 35.6 million euro and AWIND for 41.8 million euro. In 2012, acquisitions include goodwill related to the acquisition of JAOTech for 15.2 million euro and IP Video Systems for 11.3 million euro. On top, additional earn-out payments on previous acquisitions of  0.6 million euro are assumed to be probable and were added to the goodwill, and the acquisition of 50% of the remaining shares in Barco Toyo Medical Systems Japan Co resulted in 0.4 million euro additional goodwill. In 2011, acquisitions fully consist of the CineStore business combination. For more detailed information concerning these acquisitions, we refer to note 1.2.
In 2013, the impairment tests on goodwill did not result in any impairment.
In 2012, the impairment tests on goodwill resulted in impairment charges recorded for an amount of 2.7 million euro, fully related to dZine as a result of lower sales generated in the digital signage market compared to business plan targets at acquisition date.
The impairment tests on goodwill in 2011 resulted in impairment charges recorded for an amount of 10 million euro, fully related to Barco's Ventures, more specifically to High End Systems. There is no remaining goodwill on High End Systems after this impairment was booked. The global recession, which started end of 2008, had a profound impact on the fundamentals of the Media, Entertainment & Simulation business group. Total spending in the events markets dropped to less than half of levels recorded before the crisis and the conversion of analog to digital billboards came to a virtual standstill (-80%). Consequently, the value of the acquisition Barco made in prior years to strengthen its position in these markets dropped very substantially which in turn fuelled the need for impairments on goodwill. In the years after 2009, the events market recovered but High End Systems was not able to achieve a sales growth minimum required to assure a break-even EBIT result.

See below for explanations on the impairment testing performed.

GOODWILL BY CASH-GENERATING UNIT
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated on acquisition to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination. These cash-generating units correspond to the division level. Therefore, impairment testing is performed at division level. An exception is made for the Ventures, where the impairment testing is performed on a business unit level, which is one level below the division level.
The carrying amount of goodwill (after impairment) has been allocated to the cash generating units as follows (in thousands of euro):

rate of 0% (2012: 0%, 2011: 0%). A sensitivity analysis is performed on all cash generating units with respect to the discount rate (see Sensitivity to changes in assumptions ­ Discount rate).
The assumptions of the annual impairment test are consistent with external sources. Based upon the outcome of the impairment tests, management did not identify impairments for any of the cash-generating units.

The group looks at the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, amongst other factors, when reviewing the indicators of impairment. At 31 December 2013, the market capitalization of the group exceeded the equity of the group with more than 28%. As such, this general test does not show an indication for impairment.

The annual impairment tests were performed for each cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount for each of the cash generating units has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections generated by divisional management covering a five year period. Due to the level of uncertainty around future years, these financial projections have been adjusted to more conservative levels for the purpose of our impairment testing. The pre-tax discount rate applied to projected cash flows is 10.7% (2012: 9.9%, 2011: 10.2%) and cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a conservative growth

KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE-IN-USE CALCULATIONS

SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS

The calculation of value-in-use for all divisions is most sensitive to the following assumptions: » Sales growth rate used during the projection period; » EBIT; » Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period; » Discount rates;
Sales growth rate used during the projection period ­ Sales growth rate used over the projected period has been kept conservatively at zero percent for the cash-generating units within the business segments Projection and Healthcare, since even then there is no risk for impairment. For Advanced visualization, growth rate in the first year of the projected period has been set at 15%, taken into account management's expected increase in sales of the Collaboration products. In the following years of the projected period, a growth rate of 3% is assumed, same as for all other cash-generating units for which a growth rate of 3% per year is assumed for the 5 year period.
EBIT as percentage of sales ­ EBIT as percentage of sales is based on average percentages over the three years preceding the start of the budget period. EBIT levels increase over the projected period for anticipated efficiency improvements. Efficiency improvements can be cost reductions as well as margin improvements. An increase of 1 to 1.5 percentage point per annum was applied for all divisions, except for Healthcare and Projection. For the Healthcare division, a stable EBIT as percentage of sales is kept at 8% over the whole budget period, which is 1% higher than the average over the last three years. For the Projection division, a stable EBIT as percentage of sales is kept at 9% over the whole budget period, which is below the average over the last three years, since even then there is no risk for impairment.
Growth rate estimates ­ The long-term rate used to extrapolate the projection has been kept conservatively at zero % for all divisions.
Discount rates ­ Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to Barco Group. The discount rate was estimated based on a (long-term) pre-tax cost of capital, the risks being implicit in the cash flows. The long term discount rate was determined on group level and amounted to 10.7% for the year 2013 and has been applied to all cash-generating units.

With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of the Projection division and Orthogon (part of the Ventures), management believes, based on sensitivity analysis performed, that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
For the other divisions, per 31 December 2013, the estimated recoverable amount, after impairment of capitalized development recorded, is closer to its carrying value and, consequently, changes in the key assumption could result in impairment losses. The implications of the key assumptions for the recoverable amount are discussed below:
Sales growth rate used during the budget period ­ Management has considered the possibility of lower than budgeted sales growth during the budget period. For Healthcare and Defense & Aerospace, changes in the sales growth rate during the budget period does not cause the carrying value of the division to materially exceed its recoverable amount. For Advanced Visualization no or negative sales growth over the budget period would result in an impairment.
EBIT percentage on sales ­ Management has considered the possibility of lower than budgeted EBIT percentages on sales. For Healthcare, an EBIT level which remains at 7% (instead of 8%) at a constant sales level, would lead to impairment. For the Defense & Aerospace division, a reduction of more than 1% in the last year of the budget period would result in an impairment and for Advanced Visualization, any deviation from the EBIT level in the last year of the budget period would have an impairment as result.
Discount rates ­ change in the weighted average cost with 2% would result in an impairment for Advanced Visualization.
Growth rate estimate ­ a sales decline beyond the budget period would result in an impairment for Advanced Visualization if the decline would be more than 1%. Even a decrease (which would result in a negative sales evolution) in the long-term rate, used to extrapolate the projection beyond the budget period, would not result in an additional impairment for all the other divisions, in case the decrease would be less than 3%.

Consistent with the tests performed in the previous years, Barco performed impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2013. Based upon these tests, impairment costs have been recognized for an amount of 0.9 million euro. Similar impairment tests revealed the need to recognize impairment losses on capitalized development in 2012 and 2011 for 1 million euro and 1.3 million respectively. The impairment losses recognized represent the write down of certain specific capitalized development projects.
The recognized impairment losses on capitalized development are allocated to the business segments as follows:

On top of the tax losses and tax credits for which a net deferred tax is recognized (net deferred tax asset of respectively 18.9 million euro and 18.2 million euro), the Group owns tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences on which no deferred tax asset is recognized amounting to 61.7 million euro as of 31 December 2013 (at 34% tax rate resulting in a non recognized deferred tax asset of rounded 21 million euro). Deferred tax assets have not been recognized on these items because it is not probable that future profit will be available in the near future against which the benefits can be utilized. The tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences on which no deferred tax asset is recognized have no expiration date.
Deferred tax assets relate for the major part to the tax value of loss carry forwards and tax credits and almost fully relate to Belgium. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether

it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized within the foreseeable future. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax asset, the group will need to generate future taxable income in the countries where the net operating losses were incurred. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes as at 31 December 2013, it is probable that the group will realize all of the recognized benefits of these deductible differences.

(c) Long-term financial receivables Since 2010, Barco entered into a specific vendor financing program granted to a selective number of international customers. The purpose of vendor financing is to grant extended payment terms to such customers, whilst Barco continues to benefit from prompt payment of the open accounts receivable position by having a financial institution in the middle. The financial institution will directly (buyer credit) or following a receivable sale (supplier credit) open a credit in favor of the customer, thereby assuming the risk of non-payment on the spread payment plan in all material respect.

In the case of a supplier credit, Barco continues to serve as collection agent after the sale of the accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis, which leads to a long-term financial receivable from the customer (in line "Other non-current assets") this being offset by a long-term financial debt position towards the financial institution for the same amount (in line "Long-term debts"). Due to its non-recourse character, both positions are being eliminated in the net financial cash/(debt). Per the end of 2013, the outstanding long-term financial receivables have decreased to 3.5 million euro compared to 7.1 million euro in 2012. When the vendor financing takes the form of a buyer credit (direct financial contract between customer and financial institution, and no role for Barco as collection agent), no positions are being reflected in the balance sheet.

Where Barco assumes a small residual risk on the customer's payment behavior with recourse character (either in the form of supplier credit or buyer credit), provisions are being account for.

(d) Long-term financial debts A linearly amortizing 15 million euro credit facility backed by a cap-floor agreement in relation to Belgian real estate financing was early terminated in 2013. A financial leasing contract of 10.5 million euro was added following the projectiondesign acquisition.

Besides specific real-estate financing in US & Norway, the Barco Group has a total of 165 million euro committed credit facilities available, following a new debt portfolio restructuring in December 2013. The portfolio consists of 3 major tranches: » Barco NV received a 50 million euro research, development and innovation (RDI) Credit Facility from the European Investment Bank. The aim of the
facility is to finance RDI activities for networked visualization connectivity and software in its Entertainment, Healthcare and Control Rooms divisions. The Credit Facility has a remaining availability period of 6 months. Drawings under the facility have a long-term tenor of minimum 4 years. » Barco NV and Barco CC (as co-obligors) signed a number of bilateral committed Credit Facilities with a selected group of commercial banks for a total amount of 85 million euro. The Credit Facilities have an availability period till December 2016. Drawings under the facilities have a short-term tenor. » Barco NV signed a number of bilateral committed Credit Facilities for a total amount of 30 million euro (with accordion clause for an additional 7.5 million euro). The Credit Facilities aim at financing Barco's new HQ campus project and have a long-term tenor of 15 years following an availability period of maximum 2 years (period of construction).

As at 31 December 2013, an amount of 25 million euro is drawn under the RDI Credit Facility from the European Investment Bank.

Barco is meeting all requirements of the loan covenants on its available credit facilities.

(a) Earn-out payments In the agreement with Royal Philips Electronics relating to the acquisition of FIMI Srl in 2010, an additional earn-out of 10 million euro was foreseen, payable by Barco NV over the period 2011 until 2014. The earn-out equals to 35% of the cumulative net purchase value of the Philips Group with FIMI over the five years following the acquisition date and is limited to 2.5 million euro per year. In 2013, 2012 and 2011 an earn-out portion of 7.5 million euro was paid. The 2.5 million euro earn-out payable early 2014 is presented on the line "Other current liabilities".

Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated 211

The JAOTech acquisition contract provided for additional earn-out payments, which depend on the cumulative gross margin generated for the financial years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2014. There are no minimum or maximum earn-out payments stipulated in the contract. Total earnout payments of 3 million euro were assumed to be probable and were assumed to become payable early 2015. However in 2013 it became clear that the minimum requirements cannot be met anymore and therefore the outstanding loan was reversed in 2013. (see note 1.2 and note 3.d Other operating income and expense)

(b) Deferred consideration The JAOTech acquisition agreement further provides for a deferred consideration of 1 million euro, recognized as liability in 2012. As the deferred consideration is payable early 2014, the 1 million euro is presented on the line `Other current liabilities'.

(c) Vendor loan Upon acquisition of projectiondesign, a vendor loan of 12.3 million euro (103.1 million NOK) was taken over and will have to be paid to the former shareholders of projectiondesign.

The cost of these warrant/stock option plans is included in the income statement. The warrants/stock options are valued at grant date, based on the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, dividend estimates and interest rates. The warrant/stock option cost is taken into result on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the first exercise date. The share-based payment expenses amounted to 1.3 million euro in 2013 (2012: 0.8 million euro; 2011: 0.7 million euro; 2010).
4. ACQUIRED OWN SHARES Barco did not acquire own shares in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Barco sold 21,807 own shares upon the exercise of 21,807 stock options per 24 June 2013 with a resulting decrease of the own shares of 1,332 (`000) euro, 600 own shares through the exercise of 600 stock options per 20 September 2013 with a resulting decrease of the own shares of 36 (`000) euro and 350 own shares through the exercise of 350 stock options per 20 December 2013 with a resulting decrease of the own shares of 22 (`000) euro.
The number of own shares acquired by Barco NV up to 31 December 2013 therefore decreased to 715,206 own shares (2012: 737,963, 2011: 737,963).
5. RETAINED EARNINGS The change in retained earnings includes the net income of 2013 and the distribution of 16.9 million euro dividend, as approved by the general shareholders meeting of 25 April 2013.

6. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT In 2013, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations have a negative impact of 14.3 million, mainly relating to the Indian Rupee (4.8 million euro), US Dollar (2.3 million euro), Norwegian Krone (2 million euro), Australian Dollar (1.4 million euro) and Taiwan Dollar (1.2 million euro).
In 2012, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations have a negative impact of 6.7 million euro, mainly relating to the liquidation of the investment in Czech, Barco Manufacturing SRO, resulting in the realization of the foreign currency translation for an amount of 3.7million euro positive impact on the result of the year (see note 3 (d)). The remaining negative exchange differences mainly relate to the Indian Rupee (1.8 million euro negative impact on equity) and the American dollar (0.7 million euro negative impact on equity).
In 2011, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations have a negative impact on the consolidated equity of 1.8 million euro, mainly relating to the Indian Rupee (4.2 million euro negative impact on equity) offset by 1.1 million euro positive impact of the American dollar and the 1.3 million euro of the Chinese Yen.

(a) Technical warranty Provisions for technical warranty are based on historical experience of the level of repairs and replacements. Additional provisions are set up when a technical problem is detected. There are three different technical warranty provisions: provisions related to `normal' (mostly 2 years) warranty period, provisions related to extended warranty periods and provisions for specific claims/issues.

(b) Pension obligations In general, pension plans at Barco are defined contribution plans. Obligations for these plans are recognized as an expense in the income statements as incurred. In some specific cases a pension plan includes a defined benefit obligation. According to IAS 19, provisions are set up in these situations.

As per 31 December 2013, the defined benefit obligations

are composed of:

» Early retirement plans in Belgium

1, 540

» Local legal requirements

(mainly France, Japan, Korea and Italy) 5, 457

» A small number of individual plans  79

Total

7,075

Early retirement plans are recognized as liability and expense when the company is committed to terminate the employment of the employees affected before the normal retirement date.
(c) Restructuring provision In 2013, a new restructuring provision has been set up to reduce costs mainly in the Defense & Aerospace and Advanced Visualization divisions. See also note 5. Restructuring and impairment costs.
The restructuring plans, initiated in 2009, have all been finalized during 2011.
(d) Other claims and risks This provision relates to disputes with suppliers and specific customer warranty disputes. Barco can not provide details on the specific cases, as this could cause considerable harm to Barco in the particular disputes.

20 RISK MANAGEMENT - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

General risk factors are described in the director's report `Risk Factors'.

Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. These instruments are subject to the risk of market rates changing subsequent to acquisition. These changes are generally offset by opposite effects on the item being hedged.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

Recognized assets and liabilities Barco incurs foreign currency risk on recognized assets and liabilities when they are denominated in a currency other than the company's local currency. Such risks may be naturally covered when a monetary item at the asset side (such as a trade receivable or cash deposit) in a given currency is matched with a monetary item at the liability side (such as a trade payable or loan) in the same currency.
Forward exchange contracts and selectively option contracts are used to manage the currency risk arising from recognized receivables and payables, which are not naturally hedged. This is particularly the case for the USD (and USD-related currencies), for which receivables are systematically higher than payables. No hedge accounting is applied to these contracts.
The balances on foreign currency monetary items are valued at the rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the accounting period. Derivative financial instruments that are used to reduce the exposure of these balances are rated in the balance sheet at fair value. Both changes in foreign currency balances and in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement.
Forecasted transactions Barco selectively designates forward contracts to forecasted sales. Hedge accounting is applied to these contracts. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that will be determined as an effective hedge is recognized directly in comprehensive income. On 31 December 2013, there were no forward contracts outstanding under hedge accounting treatment.

Estimated sensitivity to currency fluctuations Main sensitivity to currency fluctuations is related to the evolution of the USD versus the euro. This sensitivity is caused by following factors:
» The fair value of foreign currency monetary items is impacted by currency fluctuations. In order to eliminate most of these effects in USD and USD-related currencies, Barco uses monetary items and/or derivative financial instruments as described above, which are meant to offset the impact of such results to a major extent. Impact on operating result is currently estimated at about 2 million euro when the year-end USD-rate changes with 10% compared to the beginning of a period, exclusive of the mitigating hedge impact.
» As the company has no cash flow hedges in place that aim at hedging forecasted transactions, a similar currency fluctuation in USD rates would not have any effect on the equity position of Barco.
» Profit margins may be negatively affected because an important part of sales are realized in USD or USD-related currencies, while costs are incurred to a smaller part in these currencies. Impact on operating result is currently estimated at 18 million euro when the average USD-rate in a year changes with 10%. Barco has done great efforts in recent years to increase its natural hedging against the USD by increasing its operational costs in USD or USD-related currencies and by purchasing more components in these currencies. The natural hedge ratio of Barco reached in 2013 a level close to 65%.
» Another impact is the fact that some of Barco's main competitors are USD-based. Whenever the USD decreases in value against the euro, these competitors have a worldwide competitive advantage over Barco. This impact on operating result cannot be measured reliably.

INTEREST RATE RISK
Barco uses following hedging instruments to manage its interest rate risk:
Swap on outstanding or anticipated borrowing Barco has an outstanding variable loan of 5.1 million US dollar (3.7 million euro) in place, of which variable interest rate conditions have been swapped into a fixed 3.86%.
Barco also concluded an interest rate swap of 5.7 million euro by means of a pre-hedge of expected future drawings under the 30 million euro bilateral committed Credit Facilities that aim at financing Barco's new HQ campus. This instrument swaps the variable interest rate into a fixed 2.45%.
Both swaps are determined as an effective hedge of outstanding or anticipated borrowings and meet the hedging requirements of IAS 39. The fair values of the effective portion of the hedging instrument are therefore recognized directly in comprehensive income under hedge accounting treatment.
As the US dollar swap is only partially hedge effective, the fair value of the swap for its non-effective portion (difference between notional amount of 9.4 million US dollar or 6.8 million euro equivalent and outstanding loan amount) is recognized in the income statement.
Estimated sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations Management doesn't expect the short-term interest rate to increase significantly in the immediate foreseeable future, which limits the interest exposure on the short-term debt portfolio.
With reference to the Fair Values table below, more than 90% of Barco's outstanding long-term debt portfolio has a fixed interest rate character, which again limits the exposure of the company to interest rate fluctuations. This ratio increases to over 95% when including the swap instruments disclosed above.

CREDIT RISK
Credit risk on accounts receivable Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The credit risk is monitored on a continuous basis. In a number of cases collateral is being requested before a credit risk is accepted. Specific trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and bills of exchange are regularly used in order to minimize the credit risk.
In 2013, Barco continued to conclude credit insurances in order to cover credit risks on specific customers with whom Barco entered into vendor financing agreements. Such vendor financing agreements are concluded and monitored on a case by case basis.
Credit risk on liquid securities and short-term investments A policy defining acceptable counter parties and the maximum risk per counter party is in place. Short-term investments are done in marketable securities, cash holdings or in fixed term deposits with reputable banks.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
» Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
» Long term fixed rate and variable rate other assets are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at 31 December 2013, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, are assumed not to be materially different from their calculated fair values.

Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated 219

» The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases as well as other noncurrent financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the effective interest rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. As at 31 December 2013, the effective interest rate is not materially different from the nominal interest rate of the financial obligation.
» The group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate (cap/floor) swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY As at 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

All fair values mentioned in the above table relate to Level 2.

During the reporting period ending 31 December 2013, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.

224 Barco | annual report 2013 | Barco consolidated

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the statutory auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the statutory auditor considers internal controls relevant to the Group's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used, the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, and the presentation of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
We have obtained from the Board of Directors and the company's and group's officials the explanations and information necessary for performing our audit.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Unqualified opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its operations and its cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The preparation and the assessment of the information that should be included in the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements are the directors' responsibility.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
Within the context of our mandate, it is our responsibility to report, in all material respects, our findings with regard to certain legal and regulatory obligations. On this basis, we make the following comment, which does not modify the scope of our opinion on the financial statements:
The directors' report on the consolidated financial statements includes the information required by law and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and does not contain any inconsistencies with the information that we became aware of during the execution of our mandate.

The increase of the intangible fixed assets of 13 million euro in 2013 is mainly caused by the implementation cost of SAP ERP software (10 million euro increase in 2013 compared to 8.3 million in 2012). The capital expenditures related to the new SAP ERP-software are not yet amortized as the project is still in the design phase of the global template and no roll-outs have been performed yet. The first roll-out is planned April 2014 in India.
The increase of 91 million euro of financial fixed assets consists the acquisition of the shares of AWIND (56 million euro), the purchase of the remaining shares in projectiondesign for an amount of 17 million euro (61% of the shares were bought end 2012 for 33 million euro), and the capital increase of Barco US of 18 million euro.
The liabilities mainly include intercompany debts (466 million euro), for the major part towards Barco Coordination Center NV.

Barco NV sales in 2013 amounts to 669 million euro, which is 10% lower than in 2012, mainly due to decrease in sales in Digital Cinema, but still 2% higher than the sales realized in 2011. The operating income decreased by 27% in 2013 to 31 million euro, compared to an operating income of 43 million euro in 2012.
The financial results increased from -3.7 million euro in 2012 to +5.3 million euro in 2013 due to dividends received in 2013 for an amount of 8.9 million euro (5 million euro of Barco Singapore & 3.9 million euro of Barco Silex).
The extra-ordinary result in 2012 of -14 million euro related to the statutory impairment on the investment in Barco AS (Denmark) for an amount of 7.5 million euro and on the investment in JaoTech Ltd for an amount of 7 million euro. In 2013, the extra-ordinary charges of 0.6 million euro are caused by the realisation loss on own shares through the exercise of stock options.
The profit on Income Taxes of 4 million euro in 2013 and +5 million euro in 2012 is related to a tax credit on research and development expenses.
The Board of Directors of Barco NV proposed a gross dividend of 1.5 euro per share relating to the 2013 result.
