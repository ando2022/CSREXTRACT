15 years
of doing business right...

...15 reasons our future is looking bright.
Our vision is to be the world's leading supplier of life science research tools.
We live in a golden age of biology where, almost daily, enormous breakthroughs are being made in mankind's understanding of how cells operate in health and disease. These breakthroughs are possible owing to the rapid growth in understanding at a molecular level of the role of proteins expressed by genes.
Over the last 15 years, Abcam has remained committed to supporting scientists on their quest for discovery. We've focused on continually improving our high-quality products and services by improving our global delivery times, enhancing our customer service offering and increasing the validation information of our products. We've also expanded our product range beyond primary antibodies to include secondaries, proteins and peptides, lysates, biochemicals, immunoassays and other kits as well as expanding our capabilities and services.
Throughout 2013, we worked hard to prioritise growth opportunities to ensure that our success continues. We will focus on our core business, as well as looking to extend our product offerings, capabilities and services, helping scientists to discover more.

Chairman's statement

We have a strong business model which has been bolstered by the addition of the RabMAb® technology. I am pleased to report on another successful year for Abcam.
The year to 30 June 2013 was a transformational one for Abcam in that it included the first full year contributions from our acquisitions in the 2012 financial year of Epitomics and Ascent Scientific, which contributed to our 24.9% reported revenue growth to £122.2m.
We have frequently cautioned that we expected western markets to remain challenging during the year as governments address fiscal deficits. That was certainly the case, particularly in the US which represents our largest market. Despite this, we achieved underlying constant currency revenue growth (as defined in the CEO review) of an estimated 11.8% and adjusted operating profit of £46.5m, before costs incurred during the year of £3.3m relating to the amortisation of the intangible assets arising on acquisitions and £0.4m of oneoff integration costs.

The breadth and depth of our online catalogue are important business drivers and the enhancement of our product ranges has continued apace. We added a record 29,102 products to our catalogue during the year, which at 30 June 2013 comprised 121,558 products. By volume the main contributor to this growth has been our OEM supplier base but we have also exceeded our targets on new product additions, including RabMAbs®, from our own production facilities.
Our geographical expansion has also continued and we have achieved deeper penetration in Europe, for example through the successful switch to in-house channels of revenues that were previously generated by Epitomics through third party distributors. In China we have seen the full year effect of the benefits from having our bonded warehouse facility in Beijing.
With such an extensive catalogue and diverse customer base our website and e-commerce capabilities become ever more important tools for our business and we have continued our ongoing programme of investment in these areas.
Dividends
Whilst we continue to look for opportunities to increase shareholder value through external investments, we are committed to sharing the benefits of our strong cash flow directly with shareholders through the distribution of annual dividends. Our policy is to distribute an annual dividend of 40% of adjusted post-tax profit, after adding back costs of acquisition and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles and one off integration costs.
Consequently, after an interim dividend of 1.94 pence per share which was paid in April 2013, the Directors are recommending a 17.0% increase in the final dividend to 5.10 pence per share. This would make an annual total of 7.04 pence, which is an increase of 16.4% on that paid last year. Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November 2013, the final dividend will be paid on 29 November 2013 to shareholders on the register on 8 November 2013.

Governance and the Board
The composition of our Board is kept under regular review since it is important that its members bring the appropriate skills required to improve the Company's effectiveness and performance. The Board also needs to provide clear leadership and demonstrate the values for which the Company stands.
I am pleased to report that the Board has functioned well in all respects during the year. It has provided knowledgeable and robust challenge and support to the Executive Directors, which has helped ensure that the Company's business strategy is appropriately developed and well delivered.
There was one change to the Board early in the financial year when Professor Tony Kouzarides, a co-founder of the Company, retired at the AGM in October 2012. This was after 14 years of tremendous service during which he played a vital contribution to Abcam's success and for which we again offer him our sincerest thanks.
Looking ahead
We have cautioned for several years that pressures on research funding levels, particularly in our western markets, are a concern and could impact on our growth. We have also pointed out the strengths of our business which help mitigate this challenge. The success we have achieved in our 2012/13 results demonstrates the importance of our commitment to listening and responding to our customers' needs, and builds on the excellent work done in the business since it started 15 years ago.
Looking ahead we expect market conditions to remain challenging but we remain confident that we have the capabilities and plans in place for continued success. Trading since the year end has been in line with the Board's expectations.
Abcam's staff command widespread recognition for their knowledge and commitment. It is a privilege to be part of such a team and our thanks go to them once again for another great year.

Chief executive officer's review

In this golden age of biology, our role in the centre of this quest for knowledge is stronger than ever and the opportunities for us more abundant than at any time previously.
Jonathan Milner Chief Executive Officer

In 2012/13, Abcam has again performed well in a tough environment, with impressive growth in sales and profits. Our success is a reflection of our continued commitment to provide an outstanding value-added service to our customers.
The original idea for Abcam came to me when as a research scientist I began to appreciate how much the effectiveness and productivity of the work I was doing could be improved if I could access highly validated, relevant antibodies, with top quality customer support. In the early days we experimented with a number of business models but relatively quickly the strategy we are still pursuing 15 years later began to take shape. It continues to evolve but key to our success has been the single minded pursuit of its core features which are to:
>> drive hard the addition of relevant
information on our products from as many sources as possible so that customers can validate them against their requirements;
>> build strong relationships with the
best OEM suppliers of the most relevant products;
>> ensure we are supplying highquality
products with world-class service and scientific support to help customers be more successful in their research;
>> complement the addition of products
to the catalogue with our own in-house manufacturing capabilities;

>> build the industry leading website through
which researchers have easy access to relevant products and associated data which is gathered and presented in the most innovative and creative ways;
>> Identify scientific areas which are of
particular interest to our customer base and through the dedicated gathering and presentation of information and the hosting of conferences, seminars and webinars, to provide access to an unparalleled depth of data and the work of key opinion leaders in these areas;
>> add new product ranges which are
attractive to our existing customer base, either in the same or adjacent segments in which we operate;
>> focus on understanding customer
needs to help guide our product selection and presentation; and
>> extend geographic penetration where
possible so that more users have access to our products.
This approach and the continued development of new and innovative ways to improve in each of these areas has served us well and has created a worldclass business. The 2012/13 year was no different in that regard and it is very pleasing to see how well our team has executed on our plans and the positive customer reaction we have received.

Chief executive officer's review continued

Geographic market review
The table below outlines our revenues in each geographic region, along with estimated underlying growth rates.
The Americas
The US is our largest market and has been our most challenging during the year. After a succession of budget extensions and much political debate, sequestration was finally passed into law on 1 March 2013, to take effect for the period through to 30 September 2013. Under these arrangements the budget for the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), which is the largest funding body for our US customers, was reduced by 5.5% to $29.2 billion.
In reality the uncertainty caused by the political discussions about potential cuts has slowed down our growth for some time and the NIH had begun cutting grants earlier in the year. At this point however it is too soon to say what impact sequestration will have over the longer term, nor whether the current discussions about the 2013/14 budget which will be effective from 1 October 2013 will lead to more uncertainty or indeed further cuts. Taken together, we think this means funding uncertainties look like being a feature of the US market for some time to come.

Elsewhere within The Americas region, the introduction of French language support, dedicated telephone lines and local currency invoicing for Canadian customers has been very successful, as has our change of distribution arrangements in Brazil.
Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)
The German, UK and French markets are the largest within our EMEA region. In each of these markets, and several smaller ones, relationships with former Epitomics distributors were terminated during the year or not renewed and additional marketing successfully helped drive revenue and margin growth as customers began to order directly from Abcam.
Growth in our main markets was pleasing, whilst we saw the impact of funding pressures in some of the smaller Southern Europe markets, with low or no growth in Italy and Spain. Elsewhere growth was good overall, with notably strong performances in The Netherlands, following the change in distributor we mentioned last year.

area of focus:
Customers
We invested in understanding what our customers think about our products and services and actively encouraged customer feedback so that we can improve our offerings.
In February 2013, we launched our transactional survey which encourages customers to feed back on products and services after every interaction with our customer service and technical support teams. We introduced a simple satisfaction scale on all support emails, which asks customers to rate their experience.

The introduction of French language support, dedicated telephone lines and local currency invoicing for Canadian customers has been very successful.

Understanding and investing in our customers

We receive over 400 responses from our transactional survey every month and over 82% of customers rate our service as good or excellent. For dissatisfied customers, our support teams follow up with a personal call to see how we can improve their experience.

In addition, our in-house market research team has conducted 69 unique customer surveys, which have resulted in nearly 23,000 responses globally. The results of the surveys are analysed and help us with strategic business decisions by understanding our customers' needs, perceptions and interactions with Abcam.

Survey areas include:

>> customer satisfaction;
>> product awareness
and satisfaction;
>> website user
experience;
>> brand awareness
and perception;
>> post event and webinar
follow up; and

"Thank you for the fast reply and the clear protocol."

"F ive star technical support."

"P rompt response, clear suggestions and advice that suggests understanding of customer needs."

>> post complaint follow up.

We have also carried out focus groups to better understand our customers through a more qualitative method.

We will continue to invest our efforts in understanding our customers' thoughts and requirements going into 2013/14 in order to help us shape the future of Abcam's products, processes and services.

Japan
The estimated underlying growth rate (as defined in the table on page 14) for our Japanese business was 14.2% in the year. This was a good performance particularly considering that the comparators were challenging after a very strong performance in the previous year. The Japanese government announced a significant stimulus package in January 2013 that will invest $11 billion into science and technology, including $240 million specifically for stem cell research, although the timescale for this additional expenditure is not yet clear.
The switch from the former Epitomics distributor was also very successfully implemented in Japan.
Asia Pacific
Given the strong funding in the region, particularly in China, Asia Pacific continues to be a market of significant potential for us. We saw strong growth in China which was driven in part by the improvements in delivery times from having our bonded warehouse in Beijing. Looking forward we plan further improvements in customer service and to combine the Abcam and the ex-Epitomics distribution arrangements in China, which are currently operating separately.
Elsewhere in the region growth was also good, notably in Singapore and South Korea.
Other lines of revenue
Our custom services business leverages our proprietary RabMAb® technology to provide custom antibody solutions to meet customers' specific requirements. Revenue growth over the period was driven by demand from our established customers and an increasing international presence.
The royalties and licence income comes from certain royalty payments and licence deals with life science tools companies that use aspects of Epitomics's patented RabMAb® technology in the development and manufacture of their own antibodies. These arrangements, which generated revenue of £3.2m in the year, were put in place prior to the acquisition of Epitomics and are not core to our strategy. Consequently growth has been modest in the year and we expect revenue levels from these activities to reduce over time.

We continually strive to improve the service we offer customers. The best way to do this is through regular contact and creating as many opportunities as possible to receive feedback on our performance.

Other lines of revenue continued
The small in vitro diagnostics immunohistochemistry (IVD IHC) arm of the business showed good growth. It uses the RabMAb® technology to generate high-quality antibodies for anatomical pathology. During the year our facility in Burlingame, California, received GMP certification which enables us to manufacture products directly for sale and take full control of the process. The end user market for these products is dominated by the suppliers of the analytical machines several of whom are now customers and are a focus for our business development efforts.
Acquisition integration
A major focus for us during the year has been the integration of the two companies acquired during the 2011/12 financial year.
Ascent Scientific Limited (Ascent, now known as Abcam Bristol) supplies biochemicals to our existing customer base which are complementary to Abcam's catalogue of other protein research tools. During the year the integration initiatives saw further IT development on the website to make biochemical products more accessible for customers and to facilitate the extension of Abcam's OEM strategy to this product range. In the past few months the range has expanded significantly and at 30 June 2013 there was a total of 2,766 biochemical products on the catalogue, which represents growth of over 300% on the figure at the start of the year.
The focus for the integration of the Epitomics business has been initially around the transfer of revenues to the Abcam platform, which involved the transfer of orders previously fulfilled directly by Epitomics and also products previously sold via distributors within Europe. Other initiatives have seen the successful increase in production to

1,450 RabMAbs® in the year, coordination between the teams on new target selection and some exciting work on the new product development, such as working with Abcam Eugene to introduce new kits incorporating RabMAbs®. The commercialisation of the RabMAb® technology is still at an early stage and we have many initiatives planned, targeted on revenue growth, which have the technology at their core.
Running what is now a truly global business brings exciting new challenges and I am delighted with the way in which our teams across the organisation are working together. We work hard on crosscommunication, with regular visits from senior staff and global videoconferencing linking each office. This will remain a key priority going forward.
Improvements in our customer service
We continually strive to improve the service we offer customers. The best way to do this is through regular contact and creating as many opportunities as possible to receive feedback on our performance.
In addition to our quarterly customer satisfaction surveys, which give us a broad view of customer experience, in February this year we introduced an online "transactional" feedback facility. This is a way of getting very quick feedback at every interaction point with the customer ­ taking only a couple of seconds or just one click to do so. This allows us to build a much more granular and immediate feedback mechanism which, in turn, allows us to respond faster and with greater flexibility to customer experiences.

Products
Expand our product range with high-quality RabMAbs®
The acquisition of Epitomics has enabled us to grow our RabMAb® portfolio to offer over 5,000 RabMAbs® to our customers by the end of June 2013.
Our team has also enriched RabMAb® datasheets by adding over 1,000 images from additional testing for tissue specificity and an additional 350+ scientific citations to provide our customers with the best available information.

Overview

Strategic review

Market intelligence input into the RabMAb® production pipeline since June 2012 enables us to prioritise the most valuable RabMAbs®. There are also ongoing collaborations between all our product manufacturing sites to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers.

RabMAb® integration and product launch

A unified distribution network for our customers
From September 2012 our customers could identify and buy the same products through both the Abcam and Epitomics websites. Direct links were offered at product level between both websites to enable ease of ordering and ensure a smooth transition for customers.
The successful switch from the distributor arrangements in place pre-acquisition has helped to grow revenues and margins. With the exception of revenues from the former Epitomics business in China, we have completed our plans to move catalogue sales to the Abcam platform in early 2013 and have since provided a single channel for customers to buy RabMAbs® and other Abcam products.

Marketing the benefits of RabMAbs®
A global marketing campaign was launched in November 2012, positioned around the benefits of RabMAbs® over traditional antibodies and focused on the end user benefits. RabMAbs® demonstrates a higher affinity and specificity than traditional monoclonals, which means they bind 10 to 100 times more powerfully on average.
Adoption was driven through free RabMAb® trials and local language campaigns were run in Europe and Japan to match local needs.
We also won Transaction of the Year Award at the 2013 European Mediscience Awards for the acquisition of Epitomics.

Performance review

Corporate governance

For the transactional feedback, users are invited to rate a particular interaction on a five-point ranking with the option to add some explanatory text. We are receiving over 400 responses a month through this system with around 82% of our customers rating their experience as good or excellent. This method also allows us to give immediate follow up where a customer has had a problem, as well as to give our support staff individual feedback on how they are performing.
Our IT team has also been involved in a number of projects during the year to enable our systems to scale up for growth and improve our visitor experience on the website. Our customers have seen a significant improvement in the search facility on the site which has been redeveloped to enable products to be located more easily and quickly, and our product datasheets have been redesigned for easy access to key information.

Worldwide service
IT systems are critical to Abcam and investment in our software development capability is vitally important for continuing to develop innovative business enhancing systems.
The `Agile' approach for a robust IT future
Over the last year, Abcam's development team has been working with an external software consultancy, practising and bedding in `Agile' project management methodologies and best practice modern software engineering principles. Instead of traditional `waterfall' project management, where all the requirements are gathered up front and vast effort is spent before any development starts, the Agile approach encourages more incremental development in a lean way with requirements identified in a more `just in time' fashion.
The biggest impact for our developers is that they now work in tightly knit multifunctional teams and adhere to practices such as test automation, pair programming and daily `standups' where the team members share their progress and raise any challenges they face. The benefits for the business include the delivery of robust, easy-to-use systems that are flexible and easy to change when our rapid growth requires them to adapt in the future.
Additional benefits include more efficient use of resources, as well as motivating, retaining and recruiting talent due to the implementation and best practice approach now in place. It also enables us to release business critical functional enhancements to our IT platform on a quicker and more efficient basis.

Improvements in our customer service continued
With improved customer feedback facilities and more initiatives in the pipeline, we are confident we can build on our already strong position and improve further the levels of service we offer.
Enhancements to our product range
We added over 29,000 products to our on-line catalogue in the year as we broadened our product offering and deepened our coverage in existing areas. Of these products 10,748 were non-RabMAb® primary antibodies as we continue to drive the extension of what is still by far our largest revenue contributing range. In addition the number of RabMAb® branded products passed through the 5,000 product mark, some of which are sourced from our OEM suppliers. We also continued the strategy of significantly increasing our range of protein, peptides and kits, which grew by 87% in number, and through the introduction of our OEM strategy to the biochemical field, hugely increased the range of products on offer.

Overview

Strategic review

We manufacture many of our own products at our various production facilities. Each of our facilities has met or exceeded its launch targets for the year and together our own produced products now account for 33% of our product revenue (2011/12: 23%). The remainder come from our OEM suppliers and it is through their efforts and our own investment in new IT systems to improve our speed and efficiency in uploading products that we have been able to set new records for the rate of product additions.
We have broken records in the amount of data added to the website and have also made enhancements to our AbreviewTM system so that researchers can leave reviews of our non-antibody products alongside customer Q&A; all displayed with filter and sort functionality on each product datasheet.
Investment for growth
In my review last year I said that our strategic priorities are to build on our core business, to capitalise on the opportunities from the acquisitions already made, identify new areas to expand into and, if appropriate, pursue further M&A activities. I'm pleased to say these priorities are serving us well.
During the year we have undertaken a great deal of analysis to identify where we see the opportunities for our core business, which we now regard as including the acquisitions we have made. This has identified new areas for organic growth which, for a

modest level of investment, have the potential to boost our revenues in the medium and longer term. In particular we see the opportunity to:
>> enhance the way in which we select protein
targets on which to source products;
>> improve customer engagement with
a focus on both current and potential new customers; and
>> improve our marketing by making it more
targeted and relevant.
These organic growth initiatives may be supplemented by our M&A and in-licensing strategy where they can create the opportunity to accelerate growth further.
So as to fully capitalise on these opportunities, it is our intention to step up our annual expenditure in areas such as marketing, e-commerce and operational infrastructure, by £3m to £4m per annum. We believe that the returns and higher growth will more than justify the investment made.
Board changes
One of my fellow co-founders of the Company, Professor Tony Kouzarides, retired from the Board at the AGM in October 2012. Everyone at Abcam is enormously grateful to Tony for the tremendous contribution he made during 14 years as a director and we greatly value the support he continues to provide from his laboratory in Cambridge. Without him Abcam would not be the successful company it is today. Thank you Tony.

Summing up
The pace of scientific discovery in protein interactions and their role in health and disease is accelerating. Since Abcam was founded in 1998 and the decoding of the human genome in 2000, there has been a huge increase in scientific knowledge in this area. Abcam has played a central role in contributing to this tremendous gift to humanity and to the health of future generations. In this golden age of biology our role at the centre of this quest for knowledge is stronger and more important than ever. We are therefore in the fortunate position of having an abundance of growth opportunities to pursue.
Our success would not be possible without the continued and loyal support of all our stakeholders, including investors, suppliers, customers and scientific collaborators. Especially I would like to thank our staff whose dedication, through the provision of high-quality tools and support, is unparalleled. Thank you for your contribution to our common purpose and to another successful Abcam year.

Financial review

It is pleasing that the Group reported good growth in 2012/13 whilst going through a period of significant change as we worked on the integration of the former Epitomics and Ascent businesses.
Jeff Iliffe Chief Financial Officer

Revenues of £122.2m were 24.9% ahead of last year and adjusted profit before tax was £46.6m, an increase of 19.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up by 12.7% to 17.57p.
A focus for the year has been the further integration of the two acquisitions made in 2011/12 and positioning them for future growth.
The acquisitions of Epitomics and Ascent were of different magnitudes with net consideration paid of US$150.0m and £9.8m respectively, but our approach to the integration of each has been similar. In both cases this involves the transitioning of their catalogue sales to the Abcam platform, using Abcam's extensive market data to select attractive products for their in-house production, scaling up the output of their production facilities and adding relevant data to their products.
Elsewhere in the Group we have continued the programme of investment in our core IT systems, which has made them more robust and has helped drive efficiencies. We have also undertaken a product and market review which has identified many areas which we believe are attractive for further revenue growth.
Strong growth in profitability and cash generation continues to underpin our policy to distribute dividends amounting to 40% of adjusted post tax profits. Consequently the Directors have recommended payment of a total dividend of 7.04 pence per share in respect of 2012/13, representing a 16.4% year-on-year increase.
The following table overleaf shows revenues, costs and expenses for the year, which have been adjusted to aid comparison by separately identifying the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill, other related charges arising from the recent acquisitions and the one-off costs incurred in their integration.
Revenue
Reported revenue for the year was £122.2m, representing growth of 24.9% over the prior year, which is 25.8% growth on a constant currency basis (assuming exchange rates for the currencies in which the Group sells had remained unchanged from 2011/12). This includes a full year contribution from Epitomics and Abcam Bristol. Taking into account the unaudited revenues of these businesses for the same

period last year, we estimate that this represents underlying constant currency growth of approximately 11.8%.
Gross margin
Gross margin increased to 71.0%, compared with 69.0% in the prior year. 1.8% of the uplift came from the reagents business due to a combination of higher selling prices, product mix and effective cost control. A further 0.5% arose in the Epitomics business and a negative 0.3% from the impact of less favourable exchange rates compared to the prior year.
Administration and management expenses
The acquisition of Abcam Bristol was completed on 12 September 2011 and that of Epitomics on 19 April 2012. For comparison purposes the table opposite shows the like-for-like analysis of costs excluding the direct expenses from these businesses in both years and separately identifies the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, the amortisation of acquisitionrelated intangibles and one-off integration costs incurred in the year. This shows that like-for-like costs grew by 17.9%, the main movements being:
>> an increase in staff and related
expenditure of 10% (£1.4m);
>> a market and product review was
undertaken in support of Abcam's growth strategy (£1.3m); and
>> marketing costs increased
by 18.4% (£0.3m).
There was also an increase of £0.5m in the amount credited back to profit and loss from production related activities.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development (R&D) expenditure relates to the development of new products, as well as costs incurred in searching for and developing production process improvements. These costs do not meet the requirements to be capitalised as an intangible asset and are therefore expensed through the income statement as incurred.
Overall R&D expenditure increased by 88.6% in the year to £7.9m (2011/12: £4.2m) reflecting the first full year of ownership of Abcam Bristol and Epitomics. £4.8m was incurred in our acquired entities,

Abcam Eugene, Abcam Bristol and Epitomics, reflecting our strategy to invest in these businesses and in particular in new product development. In Cambridge UK, R&D costs were £1.3m. The amortisation of the acquisition-related intangibles attributed to patents and technological know-how are also classified as R&D expenditure, amounting to £1.8m in the year (2011/12 £0.5m).
The output of this investment is reflected in the number of new product launches which saw a 14% increase from own manufactured products from Abcam Bristol and a 62% increase in new RabMAbs® from Epitomics in China. The work in Cambridge UK contributed to the first new conjugated secondary antibody product range, whilst a significant portion of the output of Abcam Eugene was dedicated to the development of a new Elisa kit range due for launch later this year.

Operating profit and expenses
As a consequence of the additional investment made in the year the adjusted operating margin reduced slightly to 38.1% (2011/12: 39.4%).
Earnings and tax
The adjusted profit before tax in 2012/13 was £46.6m, the effective tax rate on which was 24.6% (2011/12: 24.7%), reflecting the benefit of announced changes to the UK corporation tax rate and tax efficiencies arising from a Group reorganisation, which were offset by the impact of higher foreign tax rates and a reduction in R&D tax credits due to the Company now being treated by the UK tax authorities as a large company rather than an SME. After taking into account the deferred tax impact of acquisition-related intangible amortisation and one-off integration costs of £0.4m, the reported effective tax rate was 23.9% (2011/12: 26.7%).

Adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS) increased by 11.8% to 17.76 pence per share and adjusted diluted EPS by 12.7% to 17.57 pence. The basic weighted average number of shares in issue during the period was 197.7m (2011/12: 185.1m), reflecting the full year effect of shares issued on the acquisitions made during 2011/12 and shares issued on the exercise of share options.
Balance sheet and cash flow Goodwill and other intangibles
Goodwill at 30 June 2013 was £82.0m compared with £82.4m at 30 June 2012. The decrease in goodwill is due to a credit of £1.4m resulting from fair value adjustments made to the assets acquired in the Epitomics and Ascent acquisitions, which was offset by a foreign exchange adjustment of £1.0m.

Balance sheet and cash flow continued
Goodwill and other intangibles continued
Following the acquisitions of MitoSciences, Ascent and Epitomics there has been considerable change in the way these entities are structured and integrated within the Group. These changes have resulted in discrete information available for an individual entity not reflecting the true substance of the performance of that entity and the value being added. Therefore it is not possible to accurately assess the fair value in use of the acquired entities as separate identifiable cash-generating units (CGUs) as such the goodwill has been reallocated to a single CGU, being the Abcam Group. Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS but is subject to impairment review on at least an annual basis. During the year the Directors performed the review which involved making various assumptions regarding the future performance of the business. After considering various scenarios that could reasonably occur, the Directors concluded that no impairment was required. For more details, please see note 12 to the financial statements.

Other intangible assets at 30 June 2013 were £33.1m, compared with £34.3m at 30 June 2012. The movement primarily reflects amortisation of the intangible assets and the additions to capitalised software costs from the project to invest in our core IT systems which is described in more detail below. Fair value adjustments totalling £1.0m were also made during the year in respect of intangible assets from the Epitomics acquisition. Further analysis can be found in note 13 to the financial statements. Other intangible assets are amortised through the income statement over their estimated useful lives, and the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets has been added back in arriving at adjusted profit, as outlined above.
Capital expenditure
Additions of tangible and intangible assets amounted to £7.3m (2011/12: £3.0m) reflecting major items as follows:
>> further stages of an investment in our
core IT systems and website (£3.2m). This investment supports the delivery of Abcam's next stage of growth and includes the capitalisation of internal salary costs of £0.4m;

>> during the year £3.8m was transferred
from assets under construction to software costs reflecting the roll out of completed phases of the project;
>> development of new hybridomas by
Epitomics (£1.3m), with a further £0.4m having been incurred on hybridomas under construction; and
>> investment in laboratory equipment (£1.3m).
Cash flow
We maintained strong cash generation in the year. Cash generated by operations was £51.8m, or 42.4% of Group revenue (2011/12: £37.7m, 38.5% of revenue).
Following high working capital outflow in the previous year, the inflow in 2012/13 mainly reflects payables increasing by £3.6m due to an unusually high level of creditors and accruals at the year-end, offset by an increase in inventories of £1.3m and receivable balances increasing by 9% reflecting increased sales activity and a marginal increase in debtor days to 34.5 (2011/12: 34.0).

22

Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Overall, including foreign exchange movements, the Group reported a net cash inflow of £20.8m (2011/12: outflow of £38.1m). The main reason for the change is due to there being no cash outflows on acquisitions in 2012/13 compared with the £51m net outflow on acquisitions in 2011/12. Higher outflows on capital expenditure, taxation and dividends reflect the increase in the size of the business. Net cash and term deposits at the year-end totalled £38.3m compared with £17.5m at the end of 2011/12 and there is no bank debt on the balance sheet.
Looking ahead
It is pleasing that the Group reported good growth in 2012/13 whilst going through a period of significant change as we worked on the integration of the former Epitomics and Ascent businesses. The review of our business which we undertook this year has identified several new opportunities to boost our growth. These organic initiatives require investment in areas such as marketing, e-commerce and operational infrastructure which will begin this year. We expect to see the benefits from this investment in increases in revenues in the medium to longer term and believe that the returns will more than justify the investment made. We will of course continue to manage the Group on a prudent basis, control our costs tightly, maintain sound financial controls and ensure we have scalable systems to support our growth.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
Risk management policies are constantly reviewed, taking into account market conditions and the Group's activities. The Board formally reviews the Group's risk register twice a year.
Like every business, the Group faces risks in the undertaking of its day to day operations and in pursuit of its longerterm objectives. Further information on those risks and how they are managed by the Group is set out on the following pages. It is recognised that the Group is exposed to a number of risks, wider than those listed. However, we have chosen to disclose those of most concern to the business at this moment in time and those that have been the subject of debate at recent Board or Audit Committee meetings.
Further additional information on the Group's financial risk management strategy can be found in note 27 to the financial statements.

Strategic Changing market conditions
Competition
Commercial Supplier relationships

Risk

Mitigation

Whilst it is difficult to ascertain a precise figure, a large proportion (over 80%) of Abcam's sales are funded by public money, mainly through research grants. Any reduction in grant funding by central governments to address fiscal deficits is likely to have some impact on the level of demand for Abcam's products.
Separate from sources of funding, there is also a long term trend of shifting market power and influence to the faster growing economies, particularly in China and the Far East.

One of Abcam's key long term strategic objectives is to continue to expand its geographic diversity, particularly in markets which are growing and where funding, whether from public or private sources, is increasing, such as China.
In addition, Abcam's products are used as research tool consumables within laboratories, so its sales are likely to be more resilient when budgets are cut than equipment manufacturers, for example, whose customers may be more unlikely to obtain approval for large capital investment projects.

There are several hundred antibody and related product suppliers around the world. These include companies ranging from dedicated antibody suppliers to large multi-national companies selling broad ranges of other products in addition to antibodies. Abcam's rapid growth may attract new competitors and/or stimulate existing competitors, some of which have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than Abcam, to invest further in their offerings to the market.

Abcam already sources products from many of the world's leading suppliers and, in response to this risk, continues to build its supplier and product base, invest in the functionality of its website and its operational capability. The challenges for a competitor would include establishing a suitably large catalogue of products with proven validation in research, sold under an established and successful brand and if they were to follow Abcam's supply model, building relationships with a broad range of high-quality suppliers.
Abcam has also established a team that monitors and evaluates companies developing technologies or market approaches that are relevant to our strategy with a view to potential partnership or acquisition.

Abcam may lose a supplier if, for example, that supplier's business strategy changed or it was no longer willing or able to continue to provide products.

Abcam has over 400 suppliers, many of whom it has had relationships with for several years. This makes losing a supplier less likely but if this were to occur Abcam often has several antibodies to the same target whilst each is unique, and in the event of a particular product no longer being available, Abcam would look to offer customers alternative products from within the catalogue.
In the 2013 financial year no third party supplier accounted for more than 3% of Group revenue.
Abcam has its own production capabilities which could also be utilised to generate alternative products. Revenues from our own manufactured products, services and licences currently contribute approximately 39% of total Group revenue.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued

Commercial Product defensibility
Legal/regulatory/financial Intellectual property (IP)
International trade regulation

Risk
It is possible that new technologies may emerge in the future as viable alternatives to the use of antibodies in protein detection.

Mitigation
Abcam has many contacts in the industry and dedicates resource, particularly within our M&A team, to research emerging technologies within our sector. In this way, Abcam looks to stay abreast of technological developments in the field as far as is practicable, with the aim of positioning the Group to exploit the commercialisation of such technologies if they appear.

Research antibodies are not typically protected by intellectual property rights and the market can be characterised as having relatively low barriers to entry in this regard. However, where such rights are claimed to be the subject of third party patents or other proprietary rights, Abcam may be the subject of infringement actions or proceedings.
Abcam has registered IP over the underlying RabMAb® technology, rather than particular antibodies. The risk here is of work-arounds to this IP.

Abcam believes that its principal protection in the market lies with its business model rather than through intellectual property rights. The breadth of highly specified products in its catalogue, its ability to add products quickly and cheaply, its extensive supplier base and its own production capability and brand, each act as significant barriers to entry for competitors.
In addition, Abcam has no single product dependency; for example, its biggest selling product accounts for less than 0.6% of Group revenues, meaning that any infringement actions are likely to have a minimal impact on sales.
It is also our strategy to quickly commercialise our RabMAb® technology. Having products already in market provides defensibility and limits the potential impact of any work-arounds.
Our RabMAb® technology is defended by a number of patents, and we take steps to enhance this protection through further IP registrations as well as working to improve the underlying technology to remain differentiated from competing work-arounds.

The Group's activities involve importing and exporting its products across many international borders. Any changes to the regulations covering such movements might have an effect on the Group's trading activities. Increasing geographical reach and continual expansion of our portfolio also exposes us to a wider set of regulatory restrictions.

Abcam closely monitors any changes to international import and export regulations and seeks to adapt its procedures wherever possible to ensure that the movement of products is not affected, whilst maintaining compliance with such regulations.

Health & safety (H&S) and regulatory

As our product range expands, the number of different potential H&S/regulatory risks is growing. An example is with Abcam Bristol, where we are exposed to chemical substances.

We are comfortable that our internal H&S processes are robust in handling these products and have worked to ensure that we have the appropriate classification of products on the catalogue.
We use an external consultancy to perform an annual H&S audit across the Group, and perform an internal audit on any new entities as they are acquired.

Distributor relationships

In certain areas of the world Abcam works through third party distributors who undertake marketing support activities and provide local logistical support. Consequently Abcam is dependent on them fulfilling these roles in an effective and efficient manner so as to enable sales to continue to grow in these regions. The distributors act as customers and therefore represent a financial risk for uncollected account balances.

Distributors typically work on annual contracts and there is a detailed qualification process which they are required to go through before being appointed. Outside of Japan, where we sell directly to sub-dealers, distributor sales amounted to around 15% of total sales in the 2013 financial year. We have a team dedicated to maintaining close relationships with our distributors and continuing to deliver revenue growth.

Legal/regulatory/financial Foreign currency exposure
Complexity
Operational Infrastructure
Integration
Staff recruitment and retention

Risk
The Group has significant operations outside the UK and as such is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation, in particular the strength of sterling relative to the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. Although there are natural hedges in place due to the fact that the Group is able to utilise a proportion of its income in foreign currencies to pay for outgoings in those currencies, in particular the US dollar, the Group generates surpluses of each currency.

Mitigation
The Board's policy is to sell forward some of the expected surplus in order to reduce the short-term exposure. However, longer-term movements in the relative strength of sterling will impact the Group's profits.

The size of our operation and the number of employees has grown rapidly both organically and by acquisition. This brings with it the challenges of managing over large geographic distances and implementing appropriate systems, policies and compliance procedures in different jurisdictions.

Abcam has grown quickly for several years and is familiar with many of the issues this presents. The Group continues to invest in its infrastructure and apply the resources necessary to support the business and ensure that appropriate controls are in place.

Abcam operates in a market which it has been able to exploit through the use of online and e-Commerce-based systems. These systems need to be robust, efficient and scalable in order for the Group to continue to manage its growth. The risks here are both from the infrastructure and organisation of the IT systems, as well as the ability of Abcam's products to be found by online users through popular internet search engines.

The Group invests extensively in its IT systems both from scalability and security points of view, as well as from usability aspects. Abcam uses a global content delivery partner to increase both the reliability and access speed for viewing the majority of its static site content. Dynamic content is served from an external, fully supported data centre. The Group outsources regular security penetration testing on its website from a third party and pays considerable attention internally to the search engine optimisation and usability of the website through user testing, feedback and surveys.
All e-Commerce systems experience some level of outage from time to time so we continue to take action to improve our disaster recovery responses, as well as to work on redesigning our application architecture to minimise the single points of failure within our systems. The overall aim is to minimise the risk of any material impact on the business and indeed there were no outages during the year that caused a material impact.

To support the Group's growth strategy of expanding into new markets and diversifying its product range, a number of acquisitions have been made. In order for these acquisitions to perform in line with management's expectations and to minimise disruption to other areas of the business, they need to be integrated into the Group's existing operations as appropriate in an efficient and timely manner.

Integration steps are planned in outline prior to acquisition and Abcam has dedicated resource to lead the integration of acquired entities. Any issues identified are highlighted and responded to in an appropriate manner. There are open channels of communication across all levels of the Group which includes regular meetings with key management of the acquired entities and members of the Executive Management Team.
Furthermore, the continued investment in the integration and adaptability of the systems operated across the Group are planned to also contribute to the successful integration of new businesses and products.

The contribution made by Abcam's highly skilled and dedicated staff has been, and will continue to be, important to Abcam's future success. As the Group's profile grows it is important that it is able to continue to recruit and retain high calibre staff.

Abcam places great emphasis on open communication with employees, including quarterly Group-wide meetings, weekly office meetings and regular staff committee meetings. There are also share ownership schemes with rewards based on seniority within the business.
Abcam also looks to create a supportive working environment: employees are provided with significant opportunities for learning and development and are encouraged to provide feedback on this via an annual staff survey.

Message from the Chairman

13--
a rich history of successful growth
Mike Redmond Chairman 9 September 2013

Introduction
At Abcam we value corporate governance highly and this is reflected in our governance principles, policies and practices. We believe that effective governance, not only in the boardroom but right across the business, ultimately produces a better business and supports long-term performance. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that Abcam is an AIM-listed company, we are committed to ensuring that the Group is managed in accordance with the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the Code).
The core activities of the Board include:
>> providing entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls for risk assessment and management;
>> setting the strategic aims of the Group, ensuring that resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives and reviewing management performance; and
>> setting the values and standards of the Group and ensuring that its obligations to shareholders and others are understood and met.
This year, activities have focussed on the integration of and investment in the two companies acquired during 2011/12. Abcam's success is built on good governance and sound management and the Board has continued to play an active role in ensuring that these principles are core to the way we do business, with particular emphasis on new activities and geographies in which the Company operates. Commitment to these principles extends through the business and I have been encouraged by the extent of the wide-ranging discussions and the constructive and positive approach to issues that has taken place between the Board and the members of the Executive Management Team during the year.
Compliance with the Code
The Code is the standard against which we have chosen to measure ourselves in 2012/13 and we are pleased to confirm that we complied with the Code throughout the period under review.

The Corporate Governance Statement and Directors' Remuneration Report set out on pages 37 to 49 detail how the Group has applied the principles of good governance contained within the Code.
Board skills and experience
Following the appointment of three new Non-Executive Directors in the 2011/12 financial year, which increased the knowledge base and experience of the Board specifically in the life science reagents sector and e-Commerce trading, I feel we have a good balance of the skills required to take the Group forward through its next stage of development.
We recognise that none of the current members of the Board are women but remain open to the prospect of appointing women to the Board in the future. Women represent 52% of Abcam's workforce as a whole and we have two female members of the Executive Management Team.
The mix of experience on our Board and more detailed biographies are provided on the following pages.
Appointments and succession
We have made no appointments to the Board this year which reflects a balance between financial, sector specific and general business skills, with a highly experienced Executive and Non-Executive team.
As previously mentioned, following the completion of 14 years' service as a NonExecutive Director, Professor Tony Kouzarides retired from the Board at last year's AGM.
Monitoring risk
Monitoring the level of risk and ensuring appropriate governance to support this remains a key objective, involving the support of the Audit Committee. It is important that we continue to drive the level of challenge and debate around risk as well as monitor and test our understanding of risk and our tolerance as our business evolves.
I continue to be pleased with the performance of the Group and believe that we have a strong and very able Board in place which has demonstrated its commitment to drive and support future growth.

Strategic review

Performance review

Corporate governance statement

This section and the Remuneration Report detail how the Group has applied the principles of good governance contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010.
Leadership Operation of our Board
The Board holds full meetings every month, with attendance required in person one month and via conference call the next month. In addition ad hoc meetings may be called to discuss urgent pertinent issues arising during the course of the year or to approve the annual and interim accounts or dividends.
The Board has a policy, reviewed at least annually, to set out which matters are reserved for the decision of the Board and those to which the Executive Directors need not refer for approval. This policy also identifies those matters regarding which full delegation to a Board Committee is not normally permitted because a final decision is required to be taken by the whole Board. Matters which the Board considers are suitable for delegation to a Board Committee are contained within each Committee's terms of reference which are available on the Company's investor relations website, www.abcamplc.com.
The Board delegates day to day responsibility for managing the Group to the Executive Management Team (EMT) and to its Committees, details of which are set out on the following pages.
The EMT is responsible for developing and implementing the strategy approved by the Board. In particular, it is responsible for ensuring that the Group's budget and forecasts are properly prepared, that targets are met and for generally managing and developing the business within the overall budget. Variations from the budget and changes in strategy require approval from the main Board of the Group.
The EMT, which meets on a weekly basis, comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Information Officer, the Scientific Director, the Commercial Director, the Corporate Services Director, the General Manager and Vice President Corporate Strategy and Development, the Operations Director and the Chief Marketing Officer. Brief biographies and responsibilities of these key members of staff are set out on pages 34 and 35. EMT meetings are attended by other senior operational personnel, as appropriate.

The General Managers of each of our regional offices are responsible for the daily operational management of their respective entities and each report into a member of the EMT, providing a key role in ensuring a consistent implementation of Abcam's strategy across the business, along with other senior departmental managers. Brief biographies and responsibilities of the General Managers are set out on page 36.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are vested in separate individuals, each with clear allocation of accountability and responsibility.
The main responsibilities of the Chairman include:
>> leadership of the Board and creating the conditions for overall Board and individual Director effectiveness and a constructive relationship with good communications between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors;
>> ensuring that the Board as a whole plays a full and constructive part in the development of strategy and overall commercial objectives;
>> ensuring that there is effective communication with shareholders;
>> promoting the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance throughout the Company, particularly at Board level; and
>> ensuring that the performance of the Board as a whole, its Committees and individual Directors is formally and rigorously evaluated at least once a year.
The main responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer include:
>> proposing and developing the Company's long-term strategy and overall commercial objectives to ensure the Company's position remains differentiated, in conjunction with the EMT;
>> ensuring initiatives for long-term growth are appropriately championed and resourced within the Company in the short term;
>> managing the EMT;
>> leading the communication programme with shareholders and analysts; and
>> fostering good relationships with key stakeholders.

Peter Keen has been identified as the Senior Independent Director, who provides a communication channel between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors and is available to discuss matters with shareholders when required.
The Directors have the benefit of directors' and officers' liability insurance and have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who acts as secretary to all of the Board Committees.
The Board agenda
The Board agenda focuses on the themes of driving our strategy, monitoring risk and monitoring execution against the strategy via regular business, financial and departmental updates.
The Chairman meets with the Executive Directors prior to scheduled and ad hoc meetings to discuss and set each Board agenda.
The culture of our Board meetings is to encourage rigorous debate. The NonExecutive Directors regularly constructively challenge the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and help develop proposals on strategy. There is an opportunity for more informal and extended discussions on strategy during bi-monthly offsite Board dinners.
Effectiveness How do we make sure our Board is effective?
We have considered the overall balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and believe that the structure of the Board and the integrity of each Director ensure that there is no one individual or group dominating the decision making process The Board reflects a good balance between financial, sector specific and general business skills, with a highly experienced team leading the business in both Executive and Non-Executive roles.
Before each meeting the Board is provided with information concerning the state of the business and its performance in a timely manner, in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. Non-Executive Directors have the opportunity to influence agendas for Board discussions and to ensure the amount of time spent reviewing strategic and operational issues is appropriately balanced.

Corporate governance statement continued

Effectiveness continued How do we make sure our Board is effective? continued
In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting or a conference call, they receive and read the papers for consideration at that meeting and have the opportunity to relay their comments and, if necessary, to follow up with the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer after the meeting.
Director induction programme and ongoing training
On joining, Abcam Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction programme, the aim of which is to introduce them to key executives across the business and to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the Group and its activities. This includes time with each of the Executive Directors, members of the EMT and a wide range of senior management from across the business.
The Group has a commitment to training and all Directors, Executive or Non-Executive, are encouraged to attend suitable training courses at the Group's expense. Regular updates on corporate governance are also provided to the Board by the Group's advisors.
Director independence
In order to assist in securing the recruitment and retention of high calibre Non-Executive Directors, prior to the flotation of the Company in 2005, the Company granted options to Non-Executive Directors to acquire shares in the Company in addition to fees. In the period since listing on AIM, no equity-based incentives have been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans for any

such grants in the future. The Board considers Mike Redmond, Murray Hennessy, Peter Keen, Anthony Martin and Michael Ross to be independent within the meaning of the Code. All Directors maintain conflicts of interest declarations and any planned changes in their interests including directorships outside the Group are notified to the Board. None of the relationships declared are considered to be of a material nature to Abcam's business and none are therefore deemed to impact on the independence of the Directors. Whilst the obligation to notify the Company is immediate, the updated conflicts register is formally reviewed at Board meetings on alternate months.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out on page 51. In the opinion of the Board, these shareholdings do not detract from the Non-Executive Directors' independent status.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a regular evaluation of its own performance and the last review was undertaken during the year. This concluded that the Board and its individual members continues to perform effectively in an environment where there is constructive challenge from the Non-Executive Directors and operates within a framework of sound governance and practices which are consistent with the principles set out in the Code.
Subjects covered during the review include a general overview as to the operation of the Board, opinions on shareholder relationships, views on the Board's input into strategy discussions, governance and compliance, risk management and succession planning,

the Board culture and relationships with senior management, as well as how new members are selected and inducted.
The Chairman holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present and the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman's performance, with no issues arising from the review performed this year.
Accountability What is our approach to risk management?
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the shareholders' investment and the Group's assets and has established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group faces.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Group maintains an adequate system of internal control and risk management, whilst the Audit Committee reviews its effectiveness on behalf of the Board. The implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility of management.
We have implemented an internal control system designed to help ensure:
>> the effective and efficient operation of the Group by enabling management to respond appropriately to significant risks to achieving the Group's business objectives;

Strategic review

Performance review

>> the safeguarding of assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud and ensuring that liabilities are identified and managed;
>> the quality of internal and external reporting;
>> compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with internal policies on the conduct of the Group's business; and
>> the ability to recover in a timely manner from the effects of disasters or major accidents which originate outside the Group's direct control.
Our risk management process involves the following steps:
>> risk identification: risks are highlighted and documented in a centrally managed risk register;
>> risk assessment: risks are assessed in terms of likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the Group; and
>> risk mitigation: required actions are agreed and assigned, with target deadlines.
The risk register and mitigating actions are reviewed by the Board on a bi-annual basis and by the EMT as matters arise.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks inherent in a fast-moving business and can, therefore, provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The principal risks and uncertainties we have identified are set out on pages 25 to 27. It is recognised that the Group is exposed to a number of risks, wider than those listed. However, we have chosen to disclose those of most concern to the business at this moment in time and those that have been the subject of debate at recent Board or Audit Committee meetings.
During the course of its reviews of the system of internal control during the year, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant.
Whilst the Group does not currently have a separate internal audit function, an Internal Controls Committee, consisting of key members of the finance and IT teams, meets on a regular basis, with other operational managers attending where necessary. A rolling internal audit of key processes has been implemented and is carried out by members of the finance team. The results are reviewed by the Internal Controls Committee and reported

to the Audit Committee and the necessary actions taken to rectify any control deficiencies identified.
The Audit Committee reviews the need for a separate internal audit function on an annual basis and has concluded that, despite the rate of growth in recent years, the structure of the Group and the level of control exercised by the management team are currently sufficient, such that an internal audit function continues to be neither necessary nor cost effective at this time. The Directors have taken steps to ensure that the Group has an appropriate control environment for its size and complexity. The management team will ensure that the internal control environment develops with the size of the Company, with respect to the identification, evaluation and monitoring of risk.
Financial reporting
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts, the interim financial information and for ensuring they present a balanced assessment of the Group's position. Drafts of these reports are provided to the Board in a timely manner and Directors' feedback is discussed and incorporated where appropriate, prior to publication.
Whistleblowing procedures
The Group operates a whistleblowing policy which provides for all employees to raise concerns to senior management in strict confidence about any unethical business practices, fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing. They can do so without fear of recrimination and the Audit Committee receives any such confidential reports. There were no whistleblowing reports throughout 2012/13 and none up to the date of this report.
Relations with shareholders Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Board believes it is important to have open communications with shareholders. To this end, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, working in consultation with the Company's corporate and public relations advisors, make themselves available and expect to meet with shareholders at least twice a year.
Where appropriate the Company consults with major shareholders on significant issues.
Members of the Board develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders through any direct contact

that may be initiated by shareholders, shareholder feedback presented by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer following each analyst and investor roadshow, or through analysts' and brokers' briefings. We also regularly host investor days at our Cambridge, UK office.
The Board also receives feedback from the Group's brokers and financial public relations advisor who, in turn, obtain feedback from analysts and brokers following investor roadshows.
Numis Securities Limited remains as the Company's nominated advisor, financial advisor and joint broker. Peel Hunt LLP remains as joint broker with Numis Securities Limited.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board actively encourages the participation of all Directors in the AGM, which is the principal forum for dialogue with private shareholders. A presentation is made outlining recent developments in the business and an open question and answer session follows to enable shareholders to ask questions about the business in general.

Audit committee

The Board relies on the Audit Committee to provide effective governance over risk management and external financial reporting to monitor the integrity of the financial statements, to review the internal controls and risk management systems and to report its findings and conclusions to the Board. I am pleased to present my report on the work and operation of the Committee for the year, with particular emphasis on the specific matters we have examined.
Peter Keen Audit Committee Chairman

The Audit Committee is required to include one financially qualified member (as recognised by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies). Currently the Audit Committee Chairman, Peter Keen, fulfils this requirement. Peter is deemed by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience as he is a qualified chartered accountant with more than 28 years' experience in the financing and management of biotechnology companies.
Other members of the Board, the Group Financial Controller and senior representatives of the external auditor attend Audit Committee meetings by invitation in order to ensure that all the information required by the Audit Committee for it to operate effectively is available. Representatives of the Group's external auditor meet with the Audit Committee at least twice a year without any Executive Directors or other Company management being present.
During the period under review the Committee has met twice on a formal basis and a number of times informally.
What has the Committee done since the last report?
>> The composition of the Committee was reviewed to ensure that it contains the appropriate balance of knowledge, skills and experience to support the business.
>> A review of the performance of the Committee was undertaken which confirmed that it is operating effectively.
>> Any formal announcements relating to the Group's financial performance and any significant financial reporting judgements were reviewed. This included consideration of a report from the external auditor on their audit and review of the June 2012 Annual Report and financial statements and the December 2012 half-yearly financial report.
>> The scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditor was reviewed and agreed, along with the audit fee.
>> A review of the performance of the auditor was undertaken, assessing their independence and objectivity, and the effectiveness of the audit process.

>> A review of the Group's policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services was undertaken, together with an assessment of its implementation during the year.
>> A report was received from the Internal Controls Committee following a review of the application of the Group's internal control policies across each of the newly acquired entities.
>> The Committee recommended to the Board that at the end of the 2012/13 financial year the contract to provide external audit and taxation advisory and compliance services for the Group should be put out to tender for the purposes of good corporate governance.
>> The requirement for a formal internal audit function was considered.
What is the action plan for 2013/14?
The Committee continues to remain focused on the audit, assurance and risk process within the business. We intend to continue the debate around risk tolerance and appetite to ensure the Board maintains sound risk management and internal controls.
We will also continue to keep under review the need for a separate internal audit function and will consider the findings of internal reviews of the operations in Burlingame, Hong Kong and Tokyo which are planned for 2013/14.
External auditor
In accordance with the principles of good governance contained in the Code, the Audit Committee seeks to ensure the continued independence and objectivity of the Group's external auditor. The Committee also recognises that it needs to ensure that the Group observes due process from a corporate governance standpoint in their appointment. Consequently, as noted above, the Committee decided during the year to recommend that a tender process be undertaken in respect of the Group's audit and taxation advisory and compliance services for the year ending 30 June 2014. Whilst the engagement partner has been rotated in line with

Internal audit
Abcam does not currently have a formal internal audit function. An Internal Controls Committee consisting of key members of the finance and IT teams, meets on a regular basis, with other operational managers attending where necessary. In addition a rolling programme of auditing key processes has been implemented and is carried out by members of the finance team, involving visits to all worldwide locations across the Group. The results are reviewed by the Internal Controls Committee and reported to the Audit Committee and where necessary actions are taken to rectify any control deficiencies identified.
Having reviewed these arrangements the Committee has concluded that despite the rate of growth in recent years, the structure of the Group and the level of control exercised by the management team means that the establishment of a formal internal audit function is not necessary at present. The need for such a formal function will however continue to be kept under review.
Other services
Our policy is to ensure we appoint the advisor who we believe is in the position to best advise the Company on the particular matter in question. As a consequence of the geographic expansion of the Group, other non-audit fees were paid to Deloitte during the year, mainly in respect of tax and corporate finance advice. In addition we have commissioned considerable work, including tax advisory and executive remuneration advice, from other professional service firms including PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Ernst & Young LLP.

Non-Executive Directors who have served longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election. Notwithstanding the above rules, a minimum of one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation each year.
The names of Directors submitted for election or re-election at this year's AGM are provided in the other disclosures on page 51 and their biographical details are shown on pages 32 and 33.

Directors' remuneration report

Our philosophy for remuneration is to attract and retain leaders who are focused and encouraged to deliver business priorities within a framework that is aligned with the long term interests of the Company's shareholders. Against a background of the increasingly international footprint of our business, our aim is to ensure that our remuneration packages are appropriate to incentivise high levels of performance and attract professionals of the calibre required to develop a fast growing, internationally competitive business.
Peter Keen Remuneration Committee Chairman

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. Although not required by the AIM listing rules to provide all the information detailed below, the Directors have chosen to apply the principles relating to Directors' remuneration disclosures in the Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee
What has the Committee done since the last report?
In line with its remit, the following key matters were considered by the Committee:
>> agreement of 2012/13 bonuses;
>> review and agreement of Executive Director salary and cash bonus for 2013/14;
>> review and agreement of the Chairman's remuneration for 2013/14;
>> review of Non-Executive Director fees for 2013/14;
>> agreement to and finalisation of the vesting level for the 2009 award under the LTIP which matured in November 2012;
>> agreement to and finalisation of the vesting level of the earnings per share component of the 2010 awards under the LTIPs which mature in December 2013;
>> consideration of the future operation of the staff profit sharing scheme;
>> review of pension entitlements for those Executive Directors who have elected to preserve their life time allowances for pension contributions;
>> approval of the 2012/13 Directors' Remuneration Report; and
Who is on our Committee?

>> review of the proposal for which shareholder approval will be sought at the 2013 AGM for the operation of the LTIP for a further period of five years.
What is the action plan for 2013/14?
>> the latest benchmarking of Executive Directors' salary levels took place in 2010 and the Committee intends to carry out a new comparative study to support the 2014/15 salary review;
>> continue to review the operation of the Executive bonus scheme; and
>> review remuneration structures where appropriate across all Group companies.
Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors
The Committee aims to set levels of remuneration for Executive Directors that are sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre required to deliver the business strategy. Individual remuneration packages are structured to align rewards with the performance of the Company and the interests of the shareholders and to be appropriate for the size and complexity of the Group. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. The main principles are to:
>> ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level relative to external comparators;
>> support a high performance culture with commensurate rewards appropriately linked to performance;
>> maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and performance-related pay which delivers over the short, medium and longer term, with the balance becoming more long term and more highly performance related with seniority;
>> align long-term rewards with shareholders by taking account of measures that reflect shareholder interests; and
>> ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of levels of remuneration elsewhere in the Group.
The policy is that a substantial proportion of the package should be performance related. The chart on page 43 illustrates the proportion of the remuneration package provided in 2012/13 comprising fixed and variable elements of remuneration.

Subject to confirmation that such appointments will not impair the Directors' ability to perform their duties, Executive Directors are normally permitted to accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board and may retain the fees for such appointments.

Overview

Strategic review

Performance review

In the year under review no options were granted under the Plan to the Executive Directors.
The graph on page 44 shows the performance against the FTSE AIM All-share index for the options issued since flotation which have yet to vest and which have not been forfeited subsequently. If all the options had crystallised at 31 August 2013 then all performance conditions in relation to the options would have been met. Details of these options are set out in note 28 to the financial statements.
Following the acquisition of Epitomics, we have assessed the applicability of our current share schemes to our staff based in the US. Independent advice has confirmed that typical market practice in the US is to operate a scheme with vesting after two, three and four years, rather than our current arrangements which vest after three years. Permission from shareholders was granted at the AGM held in October 2012 to amend the terms of the Plan to allow the granting of such options and the Plan has been rolled out to all eligible staff within Abcam's US-based offices.
SAYE scheme
The Company has previously established a non-discretionary HMRC approved SAYE scheme in which all UK employees, including the Executive Directors, can participate. As at 30 June 2013, no options were outstanding under the SAYE scheme.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP includes performance conditions which comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share based incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which the Committee considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group. The maximum level of award (being the aggregate market value of shares subject to the award at the date of grant) that can be granted to an eligible employee under the LTIP in any financial year is limited to 150% of that employee's salary.

Following a review of the operation of the LTIP, the Committee concluded that earnings growth is the key financial measure for the Company and should therefore be the core performance measure for both the short-term and long-term incentive plans. It is transparent to shareholders and it underpins strong dividend distribution to shareholders and capital growth.
Therefore, after consultation with our major shareholders, the Committee decided that LTIP awards for 2012/13 would have no Total Shareholder Return (TSR) element with 100% of the award being based on EPS targets. These awards have proportional vesting between 10% and 20% EPS growth per annum, equating to 33.1% to 72.8% growth over the three year vesting period.
The Committee plan to make LTIP awards on the same basis subject to EPS performance conditions to be determined at the time of the award.
The LTIP was approved by shareholders in November 2008, with the authority to grant awards under it for the following five years. The plan has worked well in meeting its objectives and consequently a resolution will be put to the AGM in November to renew the authority to make awards under the plan for a further five year period.
The EPS condition
In respect of the 2012/13 awards (the EPS awards), the number of shares that vest will depend on the EPS growth of the Company over the vesting period:
>> at an average of less than 10% growth per annum, equating to 33.1% growth over the period, none of the EPS awards will vest;
>> at average growth per annum of 20%, equating to total growth of 72.8%, the EPS awards will vest in full; and
>> at growth rates between these two figures, the EPS awards will vest proportionately.

The Company regularly monitors its performance against these conditions.
The 2009 TSR awards and EPS awards vested at 96.3% in November 2012, having achieved a TSR ranking within the median quartile and an EPS growth per annum of 31.6%.
The table below illustrates the percentage of TSR and EPS awards which would have vested if the awards had crystallised as at 30 June 2013.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Abcam operates an HMRC approved SIP for all UK employees. Under the SIP, awards are made as follows:
Free share awards
Annual awards are made to UK-based staff, with a market value of up to £3,000 each. Awards take the form of a conditional entitlement to shares and will vest after three years' continuous employment with the Company.
Partnership and matching share awards
All UK-based employees are given the opportunity to invest up to £1,500 per annum to acquire new shares in the Company at market value. If these shares are held for three years and the employee remains employed by the Company during that time then they will also receive an additional share for each share acquired.
The Abcam 2009 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Group operates an HMRC approved CSOP for UK-based employees of the Company, with a maximum of £30,000 of market value options granted per employee. No CSOP options were granted to Executive Directors in the year, since they have all reached the aforementioned £30,000 limit.
Share options granted under the CSOP to other employees of the Group (excluding Executive Directors) vest either on the samebasis as those under the Plan, being outperformance of the FTSE AIM All-share index.

Directors' remuneration report continued

Pension contributions and other benefits
The Company operates a flexible benefits scheme which the Executive Directors are entitled to contributions to be made by the Company on their behalf equivalent to 12% of basic salary. The Executive Director can choose how to spend this contribution amongst the specific benefits available and also has the option to sacrifice an element of basic pay to make additional pension contributions into the Company's money purchase pension scheme or to purchase other benefits. As a result of the salary sacrificed and used to purchase additional pension contributions, the Company's national insurance liability is reduced and the benefit of this reduction is added as a contribution to each Executive Director's pension fund. This amount is included within the employer's pension contribution figures disclosed in the table of remuneration details on page 47.
Where Executive Directors have elected to preserve their current lifetime allowance for pension contributions, meaning that no further pension contributions can be made into their pension schemes, then they are entitled to draw an amount in salary or other benefits equivalent to the cost to

the Company of their pension entitlement, as adjusted for employer's national insurance contributions.

Neither the Chairman nor the Non-Executive Directors have any right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment.

Directors' contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months' notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new Directors. All Executive Directors currently have contracts which are subject to six months' notice by either party.
The details of Executive Directors' contracts are summarised below.
In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for statutory compensation payments.
All Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment and either party can terminate on one month's written notice. The details of Non-Executives' contracts are summarised below.

In addition to the basic fees, additional fees for committee duties are paid to reflect the extra responsibilities attached to these roles. Since the Company's listing on the AIM market in 2005, the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group's incentive or share schemes and are not eligible to join the pension scheme, nor do they receive any other benefits. The fees are reviewed in July of each year and fees for 2012/13 and 2011/12 are shown in the table below.
Basic and committee fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for 2013/14 will increase by approximately 4%, effective from 1 July 2013.
Audited information
The following information has been audited by the Company's auditor, Deloitte LLP, as required by the Companies Act 2006.

The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and is based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual concerned.

1As previously described, the Executive Directors are remunerated through the Company's flexible benefits scheme under which they can elect to switch basic salary into pension contributions and other benefits. The basic salary entitlement of each Executive Director during the year was: Jonathan Milner £216,000, Jeff Iliffe £227,000 and Jim Warwick £239,000. For 2012/13 Jonathan Milner waived an increase in salary of £103,000 (2012: £100,000) which would have taken his salary up to £319,000. For 2012/13 and 2011/12 his bonus and benefits were based on his salary prior to the waiver.
2From 6 April 2012, Jonathan Milner and Jim Warwick have both elected to preserve their current lifetime allowances for pension contributions, meaning that no further pension contributions have been made since this date. In 2012/13, the Company has made contributions to charities of its choosing, equivalent to the amount saved.

Other disclosures

The following additional disclosures are required by the Companies Act 2006 or have been included voluntarily in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 or the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. These disclosures are not required by the AIM listing rules.
Principal activities and Business Review
Abcam is a producer and distributor of high-quality research-grade antibodies and associated protein research products which are essential tools for life scientists, enabling them to analyse components of living cells at the molecular level.
The Group sells principally through the internet to customers across the world and now has an online catalogue of products sourced from over 400 of the world's leading manufacturers, academic laboratories and institutes. Following its recent acquisitions, a growing proportion of revenues come from its own production facilities. It also offers a custom production service to meet customers' specific requirements, providing solutions for research and diagnostic applications. The catalogue includes a growing range of non-primary antibody products such as proteins, peptides, lysates, immunoassays and other kits. Products are available for life science research and are distributed to academic and commercial users. A highly developed e-Commerce platform, which includes regional websites for the Chinese and Japanese markets, allows customers to access up-to-date and detailed technical product data sheets.
The subsidiary undertakings of the Group in the year are listed in note 15 to the financial statements.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to set out in this report a fair view of the business of the Group during the financial year ended 30 June 2013 including an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of the financial year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group (known as a Business Review).
The information that fulfils the Business Review requirements is incorporated by reference and can be found in the following sections:

>> Financial Review on pages 20 to 24;
Substantial shareholdings
Baillie Gifford BlackRock Investment Management Standard Life Investments T.Rowe Price Global Investments William Blair & Company Wasatch Advisors

>> Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 25 to 27; and
>> Financial risk management in note 27 to the financial statements.
Pages 1 to 52 inclusive (together with the sections of the Annual Report incorporated by reference) consist of a Directors' Report that has been drawn up and presented in accordance with and in reliance upon applicable English company law and the liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
Other information to be disclosed in the Directors' Report is given in this section.
Dividends
As detailed in the Chairman's Statement, the Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.10 pence (2012: 4.36 pence) per ordinary share to be paid on 29 November 2013 to shareholders on the register on 8 November 2013. Together with the interim dividend of 1.94 pence per share paid on 19 April 2013, this makes a combined dividend for the year of 7.04 pence (2012: 6.05 pence).
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company's issued share capital during the year, are shown in note 24. The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
Other than specific lock-ins and orderly marketing provisions negotiated with vendors in connection with acquisitions made by the Company, there are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company's shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28. Shares held by the Abcam Employee Share Benefit Trust abstain from voting.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company's share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.

Percentage of issued share capital
8.70% 7.53% 6.08% 4.89% 4.09% 3.54%

Acquisition of the Company's own shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under the shareholders' resolutions of 22 October 2012, to purchase through the market 19,820,000 of the Company's ordinary shares, provided that:
(i)the amount paid for each share (exclusive of expenses) shall not be more than the higher of: (1) 5% above the average market value for the five business days before the date on which the contract for the purchase is made; and (2) an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade and current independent bid as derived from the AIM Appendix to the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange or less than 0.2 pence per share; and
(ii)the authority expires at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held on 8 November 2013.
No shares were purchased under the above authority during the year under review.
Substantial shareholdings
On 30 August 2013, the Company had been notified, in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, of the voting rights as a shareholder of the Company as set out below (excluding Directors' interests which are set out opposite).
Change of control
All of Abcam's equity-based plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Under the LTIP, outstanding awards would normally be released on a change of control, subject to satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. In addition, depending on the achievement of performance conditions, other share-based payment arrangements may vest on change of control but this is subject to the approval and exercise of the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Other than some OEM supplier agreements which have an option to be terminated, the Company is not party to any agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Appointment and authority of Directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act and related legislation and, although not obliged to do so as an AIM listed company, has chosen to follow the principles set out in the Code

wherever possible. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors are described in the main Board terms of reference, copies of which are available on request.
Directors
The Directors who served throughout the year except as noted were as follows:
>> Mike Redmond >> Jonathan Milner >> Jeff Iliffe >> Jim Warwick >> Murray Hennessy >> Peter Keen >> Tony Kouzarides (retired 22 October 2012) >> Anthony Martin >> Michael Ross
Brief biographical descriptions of the Directors are set out on pages 32 and 33.
The Company's Articles of Association require that a minimum of one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation each year. At the AGM to be held on 8 November 2013 Jonathan Milner, and Jeff Iliffe who last stood for re-election in 2010 will retire by rotation as required under the Articles and Anthony Martin who last stood for election in 2011 will also retire and stand for re-election in order to meet the minimum requirement.
Following performance evaluation, the Chairman has determined that each individual continues to demonstrate commitment to his role and to display effective performance; he is therefore recommending election of all Directors offering themselves for re-election at this year's AGM.
Directors' share options
Details of Directors' share-based options and awards and shares conditionally

awarded through the Share Incentive Plan are provided in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 49.
Directors' indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the reporting period and these remain in force at the date of this report.
Supplier payment policy
The Group's policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure that suppliers are made aware of those terms and to abide by them, provided that the goods or services have been supplied in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. Trade creditors of the Group at 30 June 2013 were equivalent to 32 days purchases (2012: 34 days), based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Corporate, social and ethical policies
The Group aspires to carry out business to the highest of ethical standards, treating employees, suppliers and customers in a professional, courteous and honest manner. The Group has an ethical policy which is reviewed by the Board and which is applied to our products. This includes reviewing and, where appropriate, visiting our suppliers to check the standards they follow in their products and services. As the Group continues to grow and mature we have maintained an approach to corporate responsibility which reflects our culture and sense of fun. We take a holistic approach to the safety, health and wellbeing of our staff, support a wide range of charities within our local communities and actively work to minimise our impact on the wider environment.

Directors' interests
The Directors who held office at 30 June 2013 had the following interests in the ordinary shares of the Company. There have been no changes in the Directors' interests in shares of the Company between 30 June 2013 and 9 September 2013.

Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered the business activities as set out on pages 1 to 24, reviewed the Group forecasts and budgets as well as the Group's principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 25 and 27.
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
AGM
The AGM of Abcam plc will be held at its registered office, 330 Science Park, Cambridge, UK on 8 November 2013 at 11am. The Notice of Meeting is given, along with explanatory notes, in the booklet which accompanies this report.
Auditor
Each of the Directors of the Company at the date on which this report was approved confirms that:
>> so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware; and
>> the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Following a recommendation from the Audit Committee, it was decided that at the end of the audit for 2012/13 financial year the contract to provide external audit and taxation advisory and compliance services for the Group would be put out to tender. This will be the first such tender process since the Company floated in 2005 and will enable the Committee to compare the quality and effectiveness of the services provided by our current auditor Deloitte LLP, with those of other firms.

Statement of directors' responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
>> properly select and apply accounting policies;
>> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors' responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
>> the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
>> the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board

>> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance; and

Mike Redmond Chairman

>> make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor's report
We have audited the financial statements of Abcam plc for the year ended 30 June 2013 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and parent company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and parent company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and parent company Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and the parent company's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: >> the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 30 June 2013
and of the Group's profit for the year then ended; >> the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and >> the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: >> adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or >> the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or >> certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or >> we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2013

1. General information
Abcam plc (the Company) is incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 330 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FL, UK.
The Group is a producer and distributor of high-quality research-grade antibodies and associated protein research tools. The Group operates through its ultimate parent company Abcam plc and through its wholly owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc, Abcam KK, Abcam (Hong Kong) Limited, Ascent Scientific Limited, Epitomics Inc, Epitomics (Hangzhou) Biotechnology Co. Limited and MitoSciences Inc, allowing it to serve a global customer base of over 100 countries.

2. Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements:
Standards affecting the financial statements Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
The amendment increases the required level of disclosure within the statement of comprehensive income.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):

IFRS 1 (amended) IFRS 7 (amended) IFRS 9 IFRS 10 IFRS 11 IFRS 12 IFRS 13 IAS 12 (amended) IAS 19 (revised) IAS 27 (revised) IAS 28 (revised) IAS 32 (amended)

Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters Disclosures ­ Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Financial Instruments Consolidated Financial Statements Joint Arrangements Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Fair Value Measurement Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets Employee Benefits Separate Financial Statements Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

3. Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) except when otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in the next few pages.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

3. Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 (2008) are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except that: >> deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
>> liabilities or equity instruments relating to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree's share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
>> assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured as per that Standard.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Where applicable, cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed and tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
In accordance with IAS 21 goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and as such are translated at the relevant foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are despatched and title has passed.
Custom service revenue is recognised proportionately when the outcome of each discreet stage of the contract can be estimated reliably and is then based on the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred where it is probable these will be recovered. In instances where it is probable that the costs will be in excess of the contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Licence fee income is recognised on delivery of the licensed technology where the Group's continued performance or future research and development services are not required. Payments received prior to this are recorded as deferred revenue.
Royalty revenue is recognised based on the contractual terms and the substance of the agreements with the counterparty.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established.
Revenue derived from the Company's conferences is recognised when the conference is held; however, it is not material.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

3. Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
>> exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/hedge accounting); and
>> exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and which are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results of the operations of the Company's overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the period and their balance sheets at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of operations are classified as equity and recognised in the Group's foreign currency translation reserve.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the nature of the Group's obligations under the schemes is equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes some items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Office equipment, fixtures and fittings Laboratory equipment Computer equipment Hybridomas Motor vehicles

20% per annum 20% per annum 33% per annum 12.5% per annum 20% per annum

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

Expenditure on development activities including internally generated intangible assets is recognised as an asset if and only if it meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Payments made to acquire software, distribution rights, capitalised development work and contract based intangibles from third parties are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated minimum useful lives. The minimum useful life is determined to be between three years and five years for software, the term of the deal in the case of distribution rights and the length of the contract for contract based intangibles.

Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and an attributable portion of production overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the standard cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Available-for-sale financial assets
The Group has an investment in unlisted shares which is not traded in an active market but is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset and stated at cost less any provision for impairment.

Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Term deposits
Term deposits represent bank deposits and a charitable bond all with an original maturity of over three months.

3. Significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
Forward contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to the risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities and forecast transactions.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges).
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in the `administration and management expenses' line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. In accordance with IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2006.
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option, SIP and LTIP. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.

3. Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments continued
Fair value of options issued under the Group's share option schemes is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation.
Fair value of the awards under the Group's LTIP is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation for the TSR portion and the Black Scholes Model for the EPS portion.
Fair value of an equity-settled payment under the SIP is measured as the face value of the award on the date of grant.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments are credited to the share-based payments reserve.
The Group operates an employee share benefit trust as part of its incentive plans for UK-based employees. All assets and liabilities of the trust are recorded in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the Company until such time as the assets are awarded to the beneficiaries. All income and expenditure of the trust is similarly brought into the results of the Company.
Own shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the date of reporting the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditure during the year. In preparation of the consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by the Directors concerning the fair value of share options, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, accruals and provisions required, the carrying value of investments, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets and other similar evaluations. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of intangibles
As part of the business combinations the Group acquired the following intangible assets: licence fees, customer relationships, patents, trade names, technology and know-how. Further to this the Group capitalises IT development costs relating to the rebuilding of the Group's IT core systems, since these costs meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38. The Group reviews the carrying amount of all intangible assets held at each balance sheet date and no impairment was considered necessary for these assets.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis or more frequently when there are indications of possible impairment. The impairment review requires a value in use calculation of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. In estimating the value in use, management is required to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows attributable to the cash-generating unit and to choose an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2013 was £81,954,000 (2012: £82,356,000). Further details are given in note 12.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 27, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates.
Valuation of own manufactured inventory
The standard costs used for the valuation of own manufactured inventory require a number of assumptions concerning the allocation of overheads. These assumptions are based primarily on management's estimates of time spent in each relevant area of activity and normal levels of activity.
Provision for slow moving or defective inventory
The provision for slow moving or defective inventory is based on management's estimation of the commercial life and shelf life of inventory lines. In assessing this, management takes into consideration the sales history of products and the length of time that they have been available for resale.

5. Operating segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
The Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are engaged in providing individual products or services or a group of related products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to the core business. The information reported to the Group's Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision maker, for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. The Group has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is `sales of antibodies and related products'. The Group's revenue and results and assets for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Group's income statement and balance sheet.

The Group has no individual product or customer which comprises more than 10% of its revenues.

Geographical information
The Group's revenue from external customers and information about its non-current segment assets (excluding deferred tax and derivative financial instruments) by geographical location is detailed below:

* This relates to the interim review.
Details on the Company's policy on the use of the auditor for non-audit services are set out in the Audit Committee Report. During the prior year, the auditor was used for due diligence work as this was considered most beneficial to the Group due to the auditor's established knowledge and experience of the Group's activities. The auditor's independence and objectivity was safeguarded through the use of separate engagement teams. No services were provided pursuant to contingent fee arrangements.
The Company purchased services to the value of £35,000 (2012: £26,000) provided by Cambridge Network Limited and its subsidiaries, a not-for-profit organisation. This is disclosed due to the audit partner also being a director of Cambridge Network Limited. Consistent with the not-for-profit status, neither the audit partner nor Deloitte receives any remuneration in relation to this arrangement.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 23.75% (2012: 25.5%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

The Finance Act 2012 which provided for a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted in July 2012. This rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.

The UK Government also announced a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 21% effective 1 April 2014 and has proposed a further reduction of 1% by 1 April 2015. These further tax rate reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore have not been reflected in these financial statements.

The effect of these tax rate reductions on the deferred tax balance will be accounted for in the period in which the tax rate reductions are substantively enacted.

The impact of the rate reduction to 21%, which will be reflected in the next reporting period, is estimated to reduce the UK deferred tax asset and liability provided at 30 June 2013 by £232,000 and £29,000 respectively.

The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

2,176,531 3,383,068 199,919,941 188,514,523

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS but with a further adjustment for the weighted average shares in issue to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is derived from the number of share-based options and awards granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the year or where it is considered non-market performance conditions will not be met resulting in the options not vesting.

Adjusted earnings per share
The calculation of adjusted EPS excluding acquisition costs and amortisation of associated intangible assets is based on earnings of:

Year ended 30 June 2013 £000

* Goodwill is converted at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition and retranslated to the balance sheet rate.
Following the acquisitions of Mitosciences, Ascent and Epitomics there has been considerable change in the way these entities are structured and integrated within the Abcam group. These changes include redirecting sales through the Abcam platform and the centralisation of the marketing, technical and operational support. Consequently the discrete financial information which is available for an individual entity does not reflect the true substance of the performance of that entity and the value being added. This means it is not possible to accurately assess the fair value in use of the acquired entities which formerly constituted the separately identifiable CGUs to determine whether or not there is an indication of goodwill impairment.
IAS 36 requires that following a reorganisation in the business which results in a change in the composition of CGUs, goodwill should be reallocated to the units affected. Considering the changes above, it is appropriate to reallocate the goodwill arising from the acquisitions to a single CGU, which would reflect the reorganised business structure. This CGU is tested for impairment on a group-wide basis using the future forecast cash flows arising from the Abcam business as a whole.
The Group performs an annual test for goodwill impairment or more frequently if there are any indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions considered most sensitive for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and anticipated movements in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management has projected cash flows based on financial forecasts over a period of four years. No growth rate has been used in the extrapolation of cash flows beyond the four years. A discount rate of 11% has been estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions mentioned above. Based on the results of this analysis, management is satisfied that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. As such, no impairment of goodwill has been recognised at the balance sheet date.
Due to the headroom which exists between the recoverable amount and the carrying value there is currently no reasonable possible change in any of these key assumptions which would cause the CGU's carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

13. Intangible assets continued Company continued
The amortisation period for the up front licence fees and software is between three and five years. The amortisation period for the distribution rights is the term of the agreement.
Contract based intangibles predominately relates to two agreements: an agreement with the University of Oregon, under which the university supplies monoclonal antibodies to MitoSciences, who has full rights and entitlement to commercially exploit these materials in exchange for an ongoing fee. The remaining amortisation period is 12 years, being the remaining term of the agreement; and an agreement between Epitomics and Loyola University Chicago for access to a patent. The remaining amortisation period is to February 2015, being the expiry date of the agreement.
Assets under construction relate to the development of the core IT systems architecture. These are not amortised until being available for use in the business.
Customer relationships relates to access to new customers as part of the Epitomics acquisition, namely in the reagents and services business. The remaining amortisation period is nine years in line with the history of the business.
Patents, technology and know-how relates to the acquired RabMAb® technology as part of the Epitomics business. The remaining amortisation period is 14 years, being the remaining term of the primary patent.
Trade names relate to RabMAb® and Epitomics. The remaining amortisation period is seven years.

Following the acquisition of Epitomics Inc in April 2012, the Group undertook a restructuring to consolidate the ownership of its US subsidiaries. On 20 December 2012, Abcam plc transferred its shareholding in Epitomics Inc, MitoSciences Inc and Abcam Inc to Abcam (US) Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Company.
In consideration for the shares of US subsidiaries, Abcam plc received total consideration of £127.1m made up of shares in Group companies of £85.9m and intra-group receivables of $67m (see note 19).
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.

The deferred tax liability of £11,284,000 (2012: £12,937,000) has been recognised in relation to the acquired intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions. Amounts released from this liability during the period were £1,259,000 (2012: £374,000), representing the decrease of the deferred tax liability in line with amortisation charged against the carrying value of the associated intangible assets. A further £394,000 relates to the deferred tax movement arising from a fair value adjustment to acquired intangible assets (see note 26).

At the balance sheet date, there are no aggregate temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised (2012: £nil). No temporary differences exist in the current year as a result of a change to the UK tax legislation which largely exempts dividends from UK tax if received on or after 1 July 2009. The Directors believe that all dividends to be paid by the Company's subsidiaries will meet the criteria for exemption from UK tax.

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken for sales is 34.5 days (2012: 34.0 days). No interest has been charged on the receivables. Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. The Group and Company have provided fully for all receivables over 90 days past due because historical experience is such that receivables that are past due beyond 90 days are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 90 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit limits for each customer are reviewed on a monthly basis. No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The analysis below shows the balances included in debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group or Company has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. Neither the Group nor Company holds any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances, nor do they have a legal right to offset against any amounts owed to the counterparty.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group and Company consider any change in the credit quality of the receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. At 30 June 2013, the Group had an average of 32 days of purchases (2012: 34 days) outstanding in trade payables (excluding accruals and deferred income). Most suppliers do not charge interest for the first 60 days of the invoice. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timetable. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

The above table reflects the committed cash payments under operating leases, rather than the expected charge to the income statement in the relevant periods. The effect on the income statement will differ to the above figures to the extent of the amortisation of a £1.1m lease incentive received on signing of a new lease in 2008/09, and also the amortisation of the rent-free period included in the same lease agreement. The charge in 2013/14 on these operating leases is expected to be £2.3m for the Group and £0.8m for the Company.

26. Acquisition of subsidiaries
There were no acquisitions made during the year ended 30 June 2013. Details of prior year acquisitions and their final reported values at their respective acquisition dates are given below.
Details of prior year acquisitions Epitomics Inc
On 19 April 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Epitomics Inc (Epitomics) for total consideration of $170.0m (£108.9m). Total consideration comprised $92.5m (£57.5m) cash and 14,498,923 Abcam plc ordinary shares of 0.2 pence with a value of $77.5m based upon the average of the high and low trading prices of Abcam ordinary shares on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange for the five trading days ending on 2 March 2012, being the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and a fair value of £51.4m based on the closing share price on the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3.
Epitomics, based in the USA, with operations in China, is focused on the development, production and distribution of monoclonal antibodies (RabMAbs®). It has three core business units: reagents (antibodies), custom antibodies and in vitro diagnostics immunohistochemistry (IVD IHC). The reagents (antibodies) business unit develops and distributes RabMAbs® for academic and pharmaceutical research applications. The custom antibodies business unit develops RabMAbs® to address customers' specific needs where catalogue antibodies are not suitable and provides solutions for research and diagnostic applications. The IVD business unit provides RabMAbs® primarily for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of certain cancers including colon, prostate, ovarian and lymphoma. Additionally, Epitomics generates income from certain royalty payments and licence deals that it has with life science tools companies that pay to utilise aspects of Epitomics's patented RabMAb® technology in the development and manufacture of their own antibodies.

Details of prior year acquisitions continued Epitomics Inc continued
Epitomics represents a highly compelling strategic fit for the Group and supports the Company's vision of becoming the world's leading life science research tools company. The acquisition provides the Group with extensive know-how in RabMAb® technology and will help to diversify the Group's product offering and customer base. Epitomics also provides the Group with a custom antibody service offering and a high-quality entrypoint to the IVD IHC market. The Group intends to leverage its existing customer base and strong global marketing and distribution expertise with Epitomics's RabMAb® products, technology and product pipeline.

The table below summarises the consideration paid for Epitomics as well as the amounts recognised at the acquisition date of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with IFRS 3 (revised), the Company has considered all pertinent factors in relation to information obtained after the acquisition date which would affect the provisional values reported. During the permitted measurement period of one year from the acquisition date, adjustments have been made to the provisional values and these are summarised in the table below:

The goodwill of £71,042,000 arising from the acquisition represents the acquired product pipeline opportunities, a highly knowledgeable workforce and the going concern value to perpetuity relating to the identified intangible assets with assumed finite useful lives. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs totalling £3,213,000 are included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2012. No further acquisition-related costs have been incurred since the year ended 30 June 2012.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £3,230,000 which includes trade receivables with a fair value of £2,176,000 and a gross contractual value of £2,245,000, of which £69,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
During the period from the date of acquisition to 30 June 2012, Epitomics contributed £3,246,000 to the Group's revenue from sales to third parties and a profit of £496,000 to the Group's profit before tax, after amortisation of intangibles of £476,000.
If Epitomics had been consolidated from 1 July 2011, unaudited Group revenues for the year ended 30 June 2012 would have been £110,468,000 and unaudited Group profit before tax would have been £34,584,000, after amortisation of intangibles of £3,356,000.

26. Acquisition of subsidiaries continued
Details of prior year acquisitions continued Ascent Scientific Limited
On 12 September 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Ascent Scientific Limited (Ascent) for total consideration of £10m. Total consideration comprised £6m cash and 1,157,481 Abcam plc ordinary shares of 0.2p each, with a total fair value of £4m being derived from the rolling 25 day average price of 345.58p per share terminating three trading days prior to completion.

Ascent, a UK-based company, focuses on building a range of high-quality biochemicals for use by scientific researchers for modulating the function of proteins. The acquisition further extends the Group's product portfolio and is in line with the strategy of becoming the world's leading life science research tools company.

The table below summarises the consideration paid for Ascent as well as the amounts recognised at the acquisition date of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with IFRS 3 (revised), the Company has considered all pertinent factors in relation to information obtained after the acquisition date which would affect the provisional values reported. During the permitted measurement period of one year from the acquisition date, adjustments have been made to the provisional values and these are summarised in the table below:

The goodwill of £7,658,000 arising from the acquisition represents the acquired product pipeline opportunities, expanded customer base and a highly knowledgeable workforce. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs totalling £146,000 are included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2012. No further acquisition-related costs have been since the year ended 30 June 2012.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £263,000 which includes trade receivables with a fair value of £131,000 and a gross contractual value of £168,000, of which £37,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
During the period from the date of acquisition to 30 June 2012, Ascent contributed £1,373,000 to the Group's revenue from sales to third parties and a profit of £18,000 to the Group's profit before tax, after amortisation of intangibles of £360,000.
If Ascent had been consolidated from 1 July 2011, unaudited Group revenues for the year ended 30 June 2012 would have been £98,127,000 and unaudited Group profit before tax would have been £34,573,000, after amortisation of intangibles of £1,047,000.

27. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3. Foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of these contracts.

* Financial liabilities at amortised cost within trade and other payables consist of trade payables, intercompany payables, other taxes and other payables.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. This is because most of the financial assets and liabilities are short term.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value have been classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value of those instruments. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
>> Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
>> Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
>> Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable market inputs).
The Group's derivatives meet the definition of Level 2, as outlined above. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group or the Company. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. The Group does not have a significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and consideration is given as to whether there is any impairment in the value of any amounts owing.
The standard payment terms for receivables other than intra-group balances are 30 days. Any variation in these terms requires authorisation by senior management. Year-end debtor days are 34.5 days (2012: 34.0 days). All overdue debts are provided for where collectability is considered doubtful or the value of the debt is impaired. Objective evidence of impairment could include the Group's past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 34.5 days, as well as observable changes in international or local economic conditions.

Notes to the financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2013

27. Financial instruments continued Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments continued Credit risk continued
The standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days. There is not considered to be any risk of impairment of these receivables unless the financial assets of the entity holding the corresponding liability are impaired.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are major financial institutions. Funds are split between at least two institutions. The carrying amount best represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
Market risk
The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sales of goods and services denominated in US dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Group's policy is to maintain natural hedges where possible, by matching foreign currency revenue and expenditure. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date, not denominated in the local functional currency, are as follows:

Euros US dollars Japanese yen Hong Kong dollars

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group's principal functional currency is sterling. The Group is mainly exposed to US dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
The following table details the Group's sensitivity to an 8% increase and decrease in the sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies on the Group's profit before tax and equity. 8% represents management's assessment of the reasonable possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and forward exchange contracts in the balance sheet at the end of the relevant accounting period and adjusts their translation at the period end for an 8% change in foreign currency rates. It does not represent the overall impact on Group profitability if the exchange rate sensitivity had been applied through the reporting period. A positive number indicates an increase in profit or equity.

In management's opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk since it is limited to the year-end exposure and does not reflect the exposure during the year.
Forward exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales transactions out to 15 months within 30% to 95% of the exposure generated. Upon maturity of a forward exchange contract, the Group may enter into a new contract designated as a separate hedging relationship.
Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.

27. Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

The Group and Company hold cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to five years. At 30 June 2013, the average maturity of balances was 693 days (2012: 856 days) of fixed rate deposits not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sufficient funds are readily available to the Company to meet operational requirements.

Trade payables are normally payable within 30 days of invoice and the standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
An increase of 0.25% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in an increase in interest received by the Group of £70,000 (2012: £91,000) and by the Company of £44,000 (2012: £78,000). A decrease of 0.25% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in a reduction in interest received by the Group of £70,000 (2012: £91,000) and by the Company of £44,000 (2012: £78,000). There would have been no effect on equity reserves.
The average cash and term deposits balance throughout the year has been used as the basis for the calculations. A 0.25% increase or decrease in interest rates represents management's assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.

28. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group. The share-based payments charge relates to option awards from the EMI scheme, Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Abcam Inc share scheme, the Abcam 2005 share option scheme, the SAYE scheme, the Abcam Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the LTIP and the SIP. Option grants under each scheme have been aggregated.

The vesting period for grants under the SAYE scheme is either three years or five years, as selected by the employee at the date of grant. Those options with performance criteria vest when the criteria are met. The vesting period for all other options is from one to three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The volatility of the options is based on the average of standard deviations of daily continuous returns on Abcam plc shares. The dividend yield is based on Abcam's actual dividend yield in the past.

The risk-free rate is the yield on UK government Gilts at each date of grant. The employee exercise multiple is based on published statistics for a portfolio of companies. The employee exit rate is based on management's expectations and, in accordance with IFRS 2, is applied after vesting.

The Group recorded a total share-based payments expense of £1,391,000 in the year (2012: £1,556,000), of which £1,211,000 (2012: £1,370,000) was included within administration and management expenses and £180,000 (2012: £186,000) was included within R&D expenses.

Summary of all schemes, excluding SIP and LTIP
Options outstanding as at 30 June 2013 had an exercise price of between 5 pence and 385 pence (2012: 5 pence and 370 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life is 7.16 years (2012: 6.69 years). The weighted average fair value of the options outstanding at the end of the year was 78.02 pence (2012: 57.18 pence). The Group recorded a total share-based payments expense of £573,000 (2012: £310,000) in the year relating to all schemes excluding the SIP and LTIP.

SIP
All UK based employees are eligible to participate in the SIP whereby employees buy shares in the Company. These shares are called partnership shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee. For every partnership share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge (matching shares), provided the employee remains employed by the Company for a period of at least three years. The employees must take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Company and will not be entitled to the matching shares if they leave within three years of buying the partnership shares. In addition, the Company can also award employees up to a maximum of £3,000 of shares (free shares). There are no vesting conditions attached to the free shares, other than being continuously employed by the Company for three years from the date of grant.

For the purposes of IFRS 2 the fair value of these matching shares and free shares is determined as the market value of the shares at the date of grant. No valuation model is required to calculate the fair value of awards under the SIP. The fair value of an equity based payment under the SIP is the face value of the award on the date of grant because the participants are entitled to receive the full value of the shares and there are no market based performance conditions attached to the awards.

The Group recognised a total expense of £561,000 (2012: £404,000) in the year relating to matching and free share awards.

LTIP
The Company approved a new LTIP in 2008. To date, vesting of performance share awards made under this scheme to the executive management team have been conditional upon achievement of two separate performance conditions. Full details of these performance conditions are shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report. In 2010, LTIP awards were also made to members of senior management, in addition to the executive management team. Vesting of awards made in 2010 to senior management were conditional on market-based performance criteria and calculated using the Monte Carlo model. Vesting criteria for awards made to senior management from 2011 onwards are aligned with those awarded to the executive management team. The awards made on 9 February 2012 were to senior management and based on specific operating performance conditions over a vesting period of two years. All awards are nil cost options which vest, subject to achievement of the relevant performance conditions, after three years, and can be exercised over the following seven years. Save as permitted in the LTIP rules, awards lapse on an employee leaving the Company.

Details of performance share awards outstanding during the year are as follows:

Of the performance share awards granted during the year, 161,044 awards were made on 1 November 2012 (2012: 321,888 on 1 November 2011 and 20,800 on 9 February 2012). The aggregate of the fair values of the awards made on 1 November 2012 is £600,348 (2012: £1,025,000).

The estimated fair values of the awards are calculated using the Monte Carlo model, with the Black Scholes model used to calculate those with a performance condition based on EPS. The inputs into the models for awards granted are as follows:
