ABOUT BOLIDEN
From deposit to customer in a circular economy
Boliden's business model takes responsibility for the entire value chain ­ from exploration and mining to the recycling and production of metals.

Exploration

Mining

Concentration

Mines

Exploration Exploration ­ the search for new mineral deposits ­ is conducted to ensure the operations' future and to supply society's need for high quality metals. Boliden's exploration work employs advanced technology and tried and trusted methods to locate deposits that contain zinc, copper, nickel and precious metals.

Mining Boliden has both open-pit and underground mines. The work involves drilling, blasting, loading, and crushing the ore. Boliden's mines are amongst the most efficient in the world, thanks to hightech methods such as positioning, remote controlled machines, and premium level care for the natural environment.

Concentration The crushed ore is transported to concentrators, which are usually located in the immediate vicinity of the mine, where it is processed into concentrates with a high metal grade. The process is highly automated and based on chemical and mechanical separation and, in some cases, leaching. The majority of the mines' zinc and copper concentrate is sold to Boliden's smelters for refining into pure metall.

Raw materials feed The smelters' raw materials comprise concentrates from Boliden's own mines, external mines, and recycling material suppliers. Investments in recycling technology have made Boliden a leading player in the metal recycling field, principally for electronics and automotive batteries.

Metal production The smelters primarily produce zinc ingots, copper cathodes, gold and silver bars, and by-products, together with smaller quantities of several other metals. Process development improves the smelters' ability to increase the degree of metal extraction and thereby reduce the amount of waste generated.

Sales Boliden strives to supply the highest quality metals with the level of purity that customers require. The majority of the products are sold to industrial customers in Europe who refine them to produce copper wire and galvanized products, for example. The automotive and construction industries are the most important end-consumers.

PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT

2016 ­ a challenging start and a strong finish

Stable production, investments in organic growth, and selected acquisitions form the basis for Boliden's value creation. In 2016, every one of these bases helped generate a strong profit, despite low metal prices at the beginning of the year.

5.1
SEK 5.1 billion (4.0) ­ 2016 operating profit, excluding revaluation of process inventory

Changes take time in our capital-intensive industry and strategy puts the conditions in place for long-term success. Boliden's strategy focuses on, amongst other things, process stability, investments and acquisitions. We are building a position of strong competitiveness in each unit, with stable and efficient operations, at the same time we exploit advantages from the combination of mines and smelters. Persistence in this work has yielded results.
We invest in organic growth. The massive investments in Aitik and Garpenberg yielded world class productivity at our most important mines, coupled with the investments in Rönnskär, Kokkola and Harjavalta that improved our ability to extract metals from complex materials, are examples of this approach. 2016 also saw the acquisition of Finland's biggest mine, the Kevitsa nickel and copper mine in the northern part of the country. The acquisition was part of our new focus on nickel. We started by building up a nickel supplier and customer base for Harjavalta, and then acquired the mine, which offers substantial synergies with Boliden and provides materials ideally suited to Harjavalta.
Profits
The operating profit, excluding the revaluation of process inventory, totalled SEK 5.1 billion, in comparison with SEK 4 billion for the previous year. The year began with pressured metal prices, but global market improved after the second quarter, and prices rose. These factors, coupled with strong production levels, made the latter half of the year one of the best in Boliden's history. I particularly would like to highlight the positive trend at Garpenberg, where the massive expansion and rationalisation project between 2011 and 2014 at a cost of SEK 3.9 billion resulted in an operating profit of SEK 2.1 billion for 2016. Tara, the Boliden Area and Kevitsa also posted strong production figures and impressive profits. Smelters' strategy over the years has strengthened the ability to optimise operations and created healthy profitability. The action programme at Rönnskär running since 2014 has improved competitiveness, while Odda, whose competitiveness was poor four years ago, has implemented several improvement programmes in the last few years. A lot of things went

very well during the year, but there is still scope for improvement in several areas: production at Aitik continued to be affected by low reliability in critical equipment, and we have implemented a powerful programme that will have full impact in 2018. Exploration work in the Outokumpu field has not yielded desired results, but we will continue working in this geologically interesting area and our ambitions remain high. Smelters enjoys good profitability, but at the same time, are suffering from too many production disruptions.
Acquisitions, projects and exploration
Kevitsa and Harjavalta are a strong combination, not just when it comes to nickel, but for copper and precious metals too. The acquisition enables Boliden to make use of its expertise in grinding and mining in cold climates and to optimise the delivery chain from mining to metal production. The investment also strengthens Boliden's position in Finland, which we now regard as Boliden's second home. Operations at Odda saw an increased focus on core operations through the sale of the aluminium fluoride unit. Odda is also approaching the end of the expansion project, P200, that will see capacity increase from 170,000 to 200,000 tonnes per year.
Boliden's exploration has been successful. The biggest success in 2016 was the increase in Garpenberg's Mineral Reserves that doubles the reserve's lifespan to almost 30 years. Our traditional exploration methods in larger areas were unsuccessful in the vicinity of the Tara mine in Ireland, why we tried using seismology, which is commonly used in oil exploration work. The technique produced initial indications in 2012 and subsequent drilling has successfully identified 10 Mtonnes of Mineral Resources. Our knowledge of the mineralisation is still at the lowest level, but we are enthusiastic about its potential.
Sustainability
A strong Balance Sheet and competitiveness, coupled with a long-term approach, produce the economic sustainability that enables us to take responsibility for our employees, the environment, and society. Our operations entail exposure to risk, and Boliden therefor works intensively on a shared safety culture based on the conviction that all accidents can be prevented.

Operations

Corporate governance

Financial reports PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT

Our development will continue, taking our values as its lodestar, in order to ensure that we continue to be an industry leader when it comes to development, productivity and responsibility.

As part of our efforts to develop this culture, we focus on participation and involvement by all employees ­ an approach that is yielding results in the majority of units. In 2016, for example, Boliden's mines reported their lowest ever accident frequency, but there is still room for improvement. Concerns are sometimes expressed that mines and smelters have a negative environmental impact, but I would like to stress the positive effects. The majority of Boliden's products are needed in a sustainable society. Renewable energy sources increase society's need for copper, first and foremost, but also for zinc. Supporters of wind and solar power should, therefore, be equally supportive of both copper mines and smelters. Systems for fluctuating, renewable energy require substantial expansions of the electricity transmission grid, and this requires large amounts of copper. One of the biggest challenges faced by renewable energy is, furthermore, how to store energy in order to handle electricity consumption that are equally variable. Interest in batteries of all types is growing ­ and hence in nickel and lead, which are critical components of batteries. Tellurium, platinum and palladium are used in solar cells and in the catalysers and are also vital to environmental improvements.
Boliden's contribution to sustainable development not only takes the form of the metals used in energy systems and infrastructure, but of the way in which we share experience in environmental technology. Boliden, along with other world-leading companies, has been responsible for many technological advances and we encourage suppliers and partners to use Boliden's facilities as references when selling environmental technology all over the world. The global leverage effect of our environmental improvements is, therefore, considerable, and makes a real contribution to positive environmental effects.
Advanced deep storage facilities are another area where Boliden is to the fore. We have had an underground storage facility for waste products at Odda for many years now, and are currently building a similar one at Rönnskär for waste products from copper production. Underground storage facilities are expensive and it is consequently vital that we continue to process

products in order both to maximise the amount of materials extracted for a variety of applications and to minimise the amount of waste that needs to be stored. This approach creates circular flows and minimizes society's resource usage.
There is considerable public support for mines and smelters and we work hard to act as role models in the field of sustainability. We welcome the stringent demands made on our operations, and see our impact on air, soil and water as an ongoing challenge. This is why we set our own priorities that define how we achieve the maximum environmental effect from investments. Official requirements sometimes yield only minor environmental improvement relative to the investment, resulting in a waste of resources that is contrary to our sustainability ethos. Boliden will, therefore, continue to work to influence society to create predictable regulations and efficient licensing processes that ensure a sustainable and competitive industry in the countries in which we operate.
Innovation
Technological development and digitalization boost Boliden's productivity and we have developed a dynamic and highly innovative organisation. We are working with start-up innovation companies and several of Sweden's biggest companies to develop new solutions that not only strengthen us, but can also contribute to these companies' success. Volvo unveiled fully autonomous trucks in underground traffic to the world press at the Kristineberg mine and Ericsson is developing 5G in partnership with Boliden in the Kankberg mine. Another example of this approach is the start-up company, Mobilaris, which develops positioning systems for places where GPS does not work ­ a system developed in partnership with, amongst others, Boliden. Long-term partners such as Atlas Copco, Sandvik and ABB have also contributed to this technological development, and ABB uses Boliden as a leading reference for its digitalisation work.
Ongoing development to boost competitiveness
Boliden is undergoing a major cultural change with technology, productivity, and safety in focus. Delegation, clear leadership, and the great commitment shown by all of our employees mean that we now enjoy a leading position in several areas. Our development will continue, taking our values as its beacon, in order to ensure that we continue to be an industry leader when it comes to development, productivity and responsibility. It is with great pride that I can say that despite the weak market at the beginning of the year, Boliden has posted one of its strongest years ever.

6 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

Metals such as copper, nickel and zinc are used in buildings, energy systems, and many other settings in modern society. There are extensive opportunities for metal recycling, and demand is increasing, not least in developing economies.

1
Develop stable and efficient operations based on strong responsibility
Boliden works continuously to improve productivity by means of, amongst other things, stable processes and a focus on a strong safety culture. The expansion of Odda to an annual production capacity of 200 ktonnes of zinc has, for example, continued during the year, and a decision was taken to invest in a new crusher station at the Aitik mine in order to improve availability.

STRATEGY

2
Invest in competitiveness and organic growth
Boliden invests substantial resources in both exploration and expansion investments at existing mines and smelters. Garpenberg achieved a milled volume of 2.6 Mtonnes this year, exceeding the goal of the expansion project. Large parts of Garpenberg's Mineral Resources have, furthermore, been upgraded to Mineral Reserves, and a new inferred mineral resource was announced at Tara, extending the mine's lifespan.

3
Acquire projects and producing operations
Boliden is constantly evaluating potential acquisition objects in terms both of operational mines and new mine projects. 2016 saw the acquisition of the Finnish copper-nickel mine, Kevitsa, which offers substantial synergies with Boliden's operations. Kevitsa also ensures a stable nickel supply for the Harjavalta smelter.

 Emissions of sulphur dioxide to air  Target for 2018

The environmental impact from discharges of metals to water (metal equivalents) has declined by 40% since the base year of 2012. The discharges of metals with high toxicity (mercury, cadmium and arsenic) decreased in 2016. Rönnskär's new water treatment plant enables reduced discharges of metals, e.g. zinc and lead.

The environmental impact from emissions of metals (metal equivalents) to air has increased by 9% since the base year of 2012. Emissions of copper, mercury and cadmium have decreased, while emissions of lead increased during the year.

Emissions of sulphur dioxide to air have declined by 14% in comparison with the base year of 2012. The year on year decrease is mainly due to Boliden's investment in a new converter at the Kokkola smelter.

The carbon dioxide intensity has increased from 0.65 to 0.69 as a result of Kevitsa being integrated in the Boliden Group. The increase is due to production, including concentration, being more energy-intensive in an open pit mine and to indirect carbon dioxide emissions being higher for Finnish electricity production than for the average of Boliden's other units.

Environmental incidents Boliden's target for 2018 is zero environmental incidents per month

 Environmental incidents per month  Target for 2018
The number of environmental incidents has increased to 1.4 (1.2) per month. 17 (14) environmental incidents occurred in 2016. Nine of the events involved discharges to water, five involved prohibited air pollution, and two involved waste handling. None of the above incidents are adjudged to have caused lasting damage or significant environmental impact. One incident involved a violation of the Cultural Environment Act. See GRI appendix for further information.

Boliden has a vision of zero environmental accidents or incidents. The environmental permits held by Boliden's units vary somewhat, but if any of the permits' limit values are exceeded, a report is submitted to the relevant authorities. Reported environmental incidents indicate an event that requires attention, irrespective of whether any damage has been caused to the environment.Boliden has changed the title of the key performance indicator in 2016, from environmental accidents to environmental incidents, because the majority of the incidents do not result in any significant environmental impact. Reducing the number of environmental incidents demands efficient systems at every stage of the value chain, but also requires a focused way of working with routines, risk assessments, action plans and advanced technology.

MARKET TRENDS

Favourable price trend for base metals

Metal prices rose during the year and exchange rate trends were favourable. Zinc prices rose to high levels, and the price of copper increased, but was held back by increases in supply. High stock levels held back nickel prices, healthy demand notwithstanding.

Find out more about price trends in 2016 ) page 16­19

Market trends, 2016
Global demand for zinc, copper and nickel rose and growth levels were higher than in 2015. Copper supply exceeded demand, holding back the price of copper until the beginning of the fourth quarter. Supply from the world's zinc mines was limited by temporary closures, by the closure of large mines in 2015, and by the fall in smelter production, all of which resulted in the price of zinc rising steeply from low levels.
Global demand for nickel increased when Chinese production, in particular, of stainless steel picked up speed at the same time as the availability of nickel in China was limited, global production capacity underwent temporary shutdowns, and the availability of nickel in scrap fell from the previous year's levels. The shortage of metal notwithstanding, the price of nickel was low due to stocks of nickel remaining high.

Precious metal prices rose until the middle of the year and then fell in response to a stronger dollar and market sentiment.
Global economic growth
The demand for metals grows most rapidly in countries where the GDP per capita rises in the interval from USD 5,000 to USD 15,000 as societies develop from agricultural to industrial economies. A large proportion of the world's population still have per capita GDPs of less than USD 5,000 and hence offer potential for high levels of metal demand long into the future. Mature economies still account for a significant percentage of global metal demand, but growth in these economies is low. Mature economies' metal demand can also be more easily met by recycled metal than is the case in developing countries.

Economic trends
All mines have a limited lifespan and supply declines if new mines are not brought on line. Justifying investments in new mines requires assumptions that future prices will be sufficiently high to ensure project profitability. When metal prices are low, high cost mines are mothballed or closed permanently.
Several copper smelters have been built in the past ten years, particularly in China, and as a result overcapacity has arisen and treatment charges were consequently low for an extended period of time. Treatment charges did, however, improve a few years ago when numerous copper mines were opened and others expanded, since when copper mines and smelters have posted reduced and increased profitability,

respectively. Zinc smelters have expanded rapidly in China, but there have been few mining projects, other than expansions of existing mines. The market has fluctuated between a surplus and a shortage of metal and concentrate in recent years, and treatment charges have varied. Large zinc mines were permanently closed down in 2015, and a number have also made temporary cuts in production. A number of mining projects are scheduled to start in a few years' time, but the net contribution to mine capacity will be limited.
There has been substantial investment in nickel mines and smelters in recent years and there has been a surplus of metal. Demand rose in 2016, and there was a shortage of metal, but the metal's stock levels are overly high and prices are, as a result, being held back.

ABOUT PRICING

Metals Copper, zinc and lead prices are set daily on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Premiums, which comprise surcharges whose levels are determined by the local balance between metal demand and smelter capacity, are normally added to the price, along with shipping costs and payment terms. Gold and silver prices are similarly set by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA).

Concentrates The price of concentrate is the LME-price minus the so-called treatment charge (TC), and is calculated on that part of the concentrate's metal content that is of a payable level, which is specified in the form of terms between the mines and the smelters. The metals that the smelters can extract, over and above the payable level, are called free metals. The balance between the supply of concentrates from the world's mines and the smelters' demand for mined concentrates determines the prices and terms between mines and smelters.

Development in subsidiary markets, 2016
Demand for Boliden's main metals is primarily driven by global industrial activity levels, and by trends in infrastructure, the construction market (construction market investments), and the automotive market.

MARKET POSITION

Market position

Boliden is one of the world's biggest zinc mining and smelting companies and a smaller player in copper, but has successfully built up a position in nickel in a short space of time. Boliden also enjoys a market-leading position in the field of electronic scrap recycling and is a prominent player in the European lead recycling sector.

Mining companies - zinc
Boliden is the fifth largest zinc mining company in the world. Tara and Garpenberg are both large zinc mines by international standards. The Garpenberg and Boliden Area mines in Sweden receive revenues from a number of other metals, such as silver, gold, lead, and copper, while Tara in Ireland receives limited revenues from by-product metals.
Mining companies - copper
Boliden is a minor operator in the global copper mining industry, but a significant one in Europe. The Aitik mine is a large mine with low grades, world-leading productivity and additional revenues from gold and silver. The Kylylahti mine is a small mine with high grades. Kevitsa is a mine with good productivity and where the primary metals are nickel and copper.
Smelting companies - zinc
Boliden is the sixth largest zinc smelting company in the world. The Kokkola smelter is a major zinc producer, while the Odda smelter will, after completion of the ongoing expansion project, be a medium-sized producer.
Smelting companies - copper
The Rönnskär smelter is a major copper producer and a world leader in electronic scrap recycling. The Harjavalta smelter is a minor copper smelter by western European standards, but is the largest nickel smelter in the region.

Mining and smelting companies ­ nickel
Boliden has been producing nickel for many years in partnership with one of the world's biggest nickel companies. This partnership was wound up in 2015 and Boliden has built up its own network of concentrate suppliers and customers for Boliden's nickel product, which is known as nickel matte. The purchase of the Kevitsa mine in Finland means that Boliden now has the same structure for nickel as for copper and zinc ­ an integrated business model including both mines and smelters and where our own mines account for a substantial share of the concentrate requirement.
SOURCE: WOOD MACKENZIE, DEC. 2016

Mining and smelting companies - lead
Boliden is a significant global mining company when it comes to lead and a medium-sized smelting company for primary lead. The Bergsöe smelter also gives Boliden a significant position in the European lead recycling sector.

Competitiveness

Metals are traded and priced on global exchanges. Competitive costs and sustainable processes are critical to long-term success in that the metals are largely produced and traded in their pure forms without distinguishing properties.

Unlike pure metals, mined concentrates are not traded on exchanges, but are priced by leading operators who announce their terms in the form of annual contracts known as benchmark contracts. The competitiveness of mines ­ the cost per tonne of metal ­ is well-known to the market's operators due to the information on cost levels, known as cash cost, regularly compiled by independent analysis companies. Strongly competitive

mines often have high grades, substantial revenues from by-product metals, advantageous infrastructure, and low costs. Smelters' competitiveness is usually compared using the cash margin metric, which is a more comparable metric, in that smelters extract multiple metals and by-products. Smelters' competitiveness depends on cost levels, stable processes, and the extraction of metals and by-products in addition to their primary metal.

Aitik has a low cash cost as a result of having the world's highest productivity. Kylylahti's cash cost, as shown in the graph, is based on Boliden's own calculations. Kevitsa is a nickel and copper mine with subsidiary metals. Kevitsa is located in the better half of the industry's cost curve for nickel, and Boliden's own calculations show that Kevitsa is close to the 70th percentile on the cash cost curve for copper mines.

Rönnskär has a substantial supply of recycling materials. Harjavalta has substantial revenues from nickel.

The graphs are based on estimates and assumptions by the analysis company, Wood Mackenzie, and may differ from Boliden's own cash cost per mine data due to differences in the underlying data. There are a number of different definitions of cash cost: composite costing is used in Mine's graph, whereby mines are reported using either pro rata or normal costing. Pro rata costing divides the costs between the different metals, while normal costing reduces the costs by the net revenues from by-metals.

Cash cost, zinc
In weaker economic markets, metal prices have often reached a low point when they equate to the cash cost level for high-cost mines. The price of zinc has, on occasional trading days under challenging economic conditions, fallen towards the 60th percentile, where 40% of production has a negative cash flow. As a yearly average,

zinc prices in a weak economic climate have been close to the 90th percentile. The USD strengthened against several other currencies in 2016, resulting in local costs measured in USD falling, and the cash cost in the 90th percentile is estimated to have fallen to around USD 1,600 (1,670) per tonne.

Gold and silver
Gold and silver prices are controlled by expectations with regard to the global economic climate and they have often been sought-after metals in situations of widespread uncertainty and economic weakness. The last ten years have seen the metals become an increasingly popular component of financial investors' portfolios. Prices were, on average, higher year on year after an upturn in the spring. Prices fell in the autumn and winter as the USD continued to strengthen.
Sulphuric acid
Demand for sulphuric acid fell slightly short of supply in northern Europe. Contract prices in northern Europe fell somewhat after the first quarter. Supply increased on the spot market for exports and prices fell.

The USD continued to strengthen against the majority of the world's currencies in 2016, largely due to an expectation of a rise in market interest rates happening first in the USA, in that the country is ahead of other western countries in terms of economic recovery. The average USD/SEK exchange rate was 8.56 (8.44) and rose by the end of the year to 9.10 (8.35). The SEK was also slightly weaker against the EUR with an average rate of 9.47 (9.36). The EUR/SEK exchange rate at the end of the year was 9.57 (9.14).
The graph to the left shows the exchange rate trends for currencies against the USD for countries with significant levels of mined production for copper and zinc. The bars illustrate the change over one year and three years. A high percentage of mines' costs are in local currencies, while revenues are in USD.
Exchange rate trends have benefited Boliden, as has been true for many of our competitors, for the past three years. The SEK fell further against the USD in 2016 but there are important mining nations where the currency has strengthened against the USD during the year, such as Chile and Peru, which are important countries for copper. Russia's currency has weakened substantially over the past three years, but strengthened again in 2016.

INCOME MODEL
Income model

The metals market comprises two subsidiary markets, the market for raw materials sold from mines to smelters, and the market for metals, which are primarily sold to industrial customers. Boliden's smelters have the capacity to handle considerably larger volumes than those produced by Boliden's mines and substantial volumes of concentrate are bought in from external mines. Boliden's integrated business model generates synergies in raw materials planning and the ability to evaluate external raw materials suppliers. The model also ensures more stable revenues for the Group as the income cycles of mines and smelters often differ.

Mines
Boliden's Business Area Mines produces metal concentrate. Revenues are affected by ore tonnage, metal grades, recovery during the concentration process, the price of concentrates in USD, and exchange rate fluctuations.
The gross profit and revenues are normally the same as Mines has no input raw materials. Concentrate prices are an effect of the global market price of the pure metal and the payable metal content (the quantity of metal in concentrates for which the mines can take payment), less treatment and refining charges (TC and RC) and deductions for impurities in the concentrate (penalties). The levels of TC/RC and penalty charges are determined in negotiations between mines and smelters.
The operating profit is the gross profit less operating costs, the most important of which are personnel, consumables, spare parts, external services, energy and depreciation.

An individual mine has natural variations in grades, waste rock dilution, energy requirements at different depths, equipment maintenance and other factors that result in the profit varying over time. These variations are often known well in advance and are clearly defined in so-called life of mine plans. Boliden provides guidance on major changes in grades and volume in the larger mines.
Smelters
Boliden's Business Area Smelters produces pure metals. The gross profit is the difference between revenues (the LME price plus local premiums) and the price of the raw material.
The gross profit comprises the income from treatment and refining charges (from concentrates and secondary raw materials), penalties (remuneration for impurities), metal premiums, income from so-called free metals, and income from by-products. The metal premium is determined by regional supply and demand and constitutes a local adjustment of the LME price, including such factors as transportation, customised alloys, and payment terms. Free metals arise when the quantity of the metal extracted during concentration exceeds the payable metal content of the concentrates purchased by the smelter. By-products extracted during the processing, such as sulphuric acid, also generate important revenues.
The operating profit comprises the gross profit less operating costs for personnel, consumables, external services, energy, and depreciation. The operating profit is reported excluding revaluation of the smelters' process inventory (PIR) in order to provide a better picture of the underlying trend.
Unlike mines, smelters have a similar production situation over time with the exception of maintenance shutdowns of varying lengths. An individual smelter has minor shutdowns every year and conducts major maintenance work at 3-10 year intervals. Boliden provides guidance on maintenance shutdowns for the year ahead.

THE KEVITSA ACQUISITION
Mine acquisition in strategically important area boosts nickel operations

On 10 March, Boliden entered into an agreement with First Quantum to acquire the Kevitsa copper and nickel mine in northern Finland. The acquisition, which was completed on 1 June, is consistent with Boliden's strategy and gives the Group a high quality mine with a good operational fit. Boliden and Kevitsa have synergies in the fields of mining, concentration, smelting, regional exploration, and the supply of suitable materials for Boliden's Harjavalta and Rönnskär smelters.
The acquisition ensures a stable supply of high quality nickel concentrate for the Harjavalta smelter and of copper concentrate for Harjavalta and Rönnskär.

The acquisition expands Boliden's platform in Finland ­ a geologically attractive region ­ and gives Boliden a second home market. The total consideration for the transaction was SEK 5,961 million and was paid in cash, financed with a new syndicated loan.
Kevitsa, which is an open-pit mine, came on line in 2012 and is currently in a developmental phase. The operations comprise a mine and a concentrator, together with associated facilities. Kevitsa produces two metal concentrates containing copper, nickel, gold, platinum and palladium. The deposit was discovered in 1987 and is one of the biggest ore finds ever in Finland.

Financial reports GROUP PERFORMANCE

Group performance during the year

The focus during the year was on increased production stability, improved safety work, and the integration of the Kevitsa copper-nickel mine acquired. Market terms improved substantially during the latter half of the year.

Revenues and operating profit
Boliden's revenues totalled SEK 40,316 m (40,242). The operating profit totalled SEK 5,682 m (3,590)
and the operating profit excluding the revaluation of process inventory was SEK 5,094 m (4,010).
The operating profit for Mines totalled SEK 2,804 m (1,429), while for Smelters, the operating profit excluding revaluation of process inventory was SEK 2,759 m (2,692).
Adjusted for the acquisition of Kevitsa, the operating profit excluding the revaluation of process inventory increased by SEK 985 m as a result of higher production levels, primarily within Mines, and improved market terms. Deteriorations in treatment charge terms and metal premiums, coupled with the lower price for sulphuric acid, had a negative effect on the profit. Planned maintenance shutdowns for Smelters were charged to the profit in the sum of approximately SEK 260 m (290) in the form of lower production and higher costs.
The Group's operating costs before depreciation totalled SEK 12,757 m (11,581), corresponding to an increase of 12% in local currencies. Adjusted for Kevitsa, costs increased by 4% in local currencies, with the increase largely due to higher levels of mined production and higher staff overheads. Purchasing prices fell slightly overall for the Group in 2016, despite a sharply rising USD.
Depreciation increased, mainly due to the acquisition of Kevitsa, higher levels of mined production and to the fact that production at Aitik took place in capital-intensive areas.
The Group's operating profit includes items affecting comparability with a net of SEK 256 m (­45), comprising the transformation of Tara's defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan (SEK 248 m), acquisition costs related to Kevitsa (SEK ­39 m), and capital gains on the divestment of the aluminium fluoride operations at Odda (SEK 47 m). Last year, this item comprised the cost of energy tax on diesel at Aitik (SEK ­212 m), changes to pension terms at Tara (SEK 227 m), and the correction of Smelters' internal profit calculation (SEK ­60 m).
Net financial items for the year totalled SEK ­308 m (­234) and the profit after financial items was

SEK 5,375 m (3,356). The reported tax for the year totalled SEK ­1,135 m (­715), corresponding to an average tax rate of 21% (21).
The net profit for the year was SEK 4,239 m (2,641), corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 15.49 (9.65).

BUSINESS AREA MINES

World class mine productivity through technological development

High-level expertise in developing and operating mines based on cutting-edge technology make Boliden's mines highly competitive. Investments in automation and remote control are yielding increased productivity and improved safety, and a number of new measures were implemented during the past year.

Boliden aims to boost competitiveness and to meet the world's demand for metals in a sustainable way by working to improve its productivity and environmental performance, and to engage in successful exploration and commercial development. In-house expertise and partnerships with several leading suppliers are progressing development in the field of mine automation, for example, resulting in Boliden's biggest mines, Garpenberg and Aitik achieving world class productivity. Efforts to create an improved safety culture over the past year have resulted in increased employee commitment to safety and an increase in the number of risks reported.
Boliden also invests heavily in the reclamation of mining areas once they are wound up in order to minimise any future impact on the air, soil or water. Boliden's ambition at all times is to use the optimum technology, e.g. for covering, monitoring, sampling, and inspection work. The work is carried out in paral-

lel with operations and the reclamation of Aitik is, for example, already being prepared although the mining operations there are expected to continue for at least another 25 years. Boliden is open to visitors from other mining companies with a view to environmental technology knowledge sharing and in an effort to contribute to a global reduction in the environmental impact of our industry.
Investments
Boliden's mines have focused not only on development work in new mining stopes, but also on maintenance investments designed to increase availability and utilisation levels. The substantial ongoing investment in a new crusher station at Aitik will improve stability and enable higher production levels.
The concentrators' focus is primarily on measures designed to improve processing and thereby increase metal recovery.

Automation increases safety and productivity
Boliden's mines are trialling and refining new automation technology to create tomorrow's mining technology. Remote controlled and automatic machines can increase productivity by 40% due to, for example, their ability to work when people cannot be underground, e.g. in conjunction with blasting and during shift changes. At the Kristineberg mine in the Boliden Area, the Volvo Group is developing technical systems for autonomous trucks ­ the first in the world to be tested in real life situations underground. The pilot project is part of Boliden's efforts to develop automation underground and thereby make improvements in competitiveness, safety and environmental performance.

The substantial investment in the construction of a new crusher station at Aitik will improve stability and enable higher production levels.

Eco-friendly water treatment technology

The employees at Boliden's technology department have invented and patented a method of treating water to remove nitrous compounds and so-called thiosalts that may be present in the process water from the mines. The method is called ADSOX (Autogenous Denitrification with Sulphur Oxidizers) and is bacterial, and consequently more eco-friendly as it does not require any chemicals classified as hazardous. ADSOX differs from traditional

technology and results in lower investment and operating costs. ADSOX has been evaluated at Aitik and a larger scale trial is now being conducted in the Boliden Area.

Ecological compensation plan

The world's most modern mobile network

40%
Remote-controlled and automated machines can boost productivity by 40%.

In 2014, Boliden was granted a permit to increase production at the Aitik mine. During the permit hearings, Boliden made a voluntary undertaking to carry out ecological compensation in two adjacent nature sites. Ecological compensation involves a company delivering new environmental resources or enhancing existing ones and securing them for the future. This may, for example, involve the relocation of protected species of trees, controlled burns, or the promotion of birdlife and outdoor activities. The compensation plan was approved by the County Council in 2016 and Boliden has begun a five-year implementation period. The measures taken will be followed up as part of a comprehensive research partnership with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

All of Boliden's Swedish mines now have wireless networks, known as WLAN. The next step is now being taken at the Kankberg mine in the Boliden Area with underground trials of tomorrow's mobile network. The network being evaluated is the fifth generation mobile network, 5G, putting Boliden at the absolute forefront of in-mine connections. The technology offers short response times, which is vital for remote controlled operations. A successful implementation of 5G would mean taking another step towards mine automation, enhancing both competitiveness and the safety of the working environment. Boliden is
cooperating in the pilot project with a number of leading suppliers, including Ericsson, Telia, ABB and Volvo.

Tailings pond

Refuge chambers
All of Boliden's mines are equipped with refuge chambers where people can seek safety for up to six hours. Each chamber contains supplies of air, water and communication equipment.

Exploration
Long-term and systematic exploration work is carried out with the aim of identifying new minable deposits. Flight inspections, rock surface finds, geophysical and seismic methods make up the initial phases, while core drilling is the final stage in confirming a mineralisation. Boliden uses a range of different techniques and some of the instruments used were developed in-house by Boliden's instrument laboratory.

Positioning
Boliden uses positioning systems that enable the exact position of individuals and vehicles equipped with a tag to be located underground in real time. The technology offers similar functionality to GPS, which is even more important underground in order to provide visual flows in production. The technology improves the safety of the working environment and increases productivity by allowing the operations centre to plan different transportation routes and control production.

Remote control
The journey down to workplaces in the mines, which may lie several hundred metres underground, can take up to an hour. Operators can now increasingly control loading and drilling machines from control rooms. Some of the loading machines drive themselves (autonomously) to the shaft and tip the ore, and then drive back so that more ore can be loaded.

Environmental expertise
Boliden's environmental experts progress the company's development in such areas as water management, water treatment, and reclamation of former mining areas. Their combined expertise is used in the important and wide-ranging licensing processes that are led by Boliden's experienced Project Managers. This approach has resulted in high environmental performance.

Optimal mine design
The Aitik open-pit mine's productivity is amongst the highest in the world when it comes to copper mines, due to its cutting edge technology and logistics and to the way in which the mine is designed. Crusher stations down in the mine mean short routes, leading to fewer trucks. After crushing, the ore is transported to the concentrator on conveyor belts, resulting in low costs and high productivity.

Mobile control rooms
The concentrators' control rooms are connected to mobile units, giving the operators access to processing data in real time. The operators steer and control the processes via mobile phones or tablets, increasing understanding and communication between individuals, departments and suppliers. This, in turn, enables faster intervention, for example, when adjustments to processes are required.

Concentration of complex ores
Boliden has developed concentrating techniques for complex ores. Mineralogical studies are used systematically to optimise the concentration process. Boliden has a pilot concentrator that is used to evaluate processes with new minerals or to enhance performance in the concentrators.

Autogenous grinding
Boliden's concentrators mainly use a technology known as autogenous grinding, whereby the ore grinds itself. The technique cuts costs but requires more advanced control than conventional technologies. Autogenous grinding also results in less wear and reduced maintenance costs.

BUSINESS AREA MINES

Financial information
The majority of Mines' sales are made to Boliden's smelters on market terms. Revenues increased to SEK 12,659 m (9,808), with external sales accounting for SEK 1,776 m (1,208) of this total.
Mines' operating profit increased to SEK 2,804 m (1,429). Adjusted for the acquisition of Kevitsa, the operating profit for the year as a whole improved by SEK 1,277 m due to higher volumes in all mining areas and improvements in metal prices. The higher level of mined production also resulted in increases in both costs and depreciation.
Aitik's operating profit, adjusted for last year's diesel energy tax cost of SEK -212 m, fell during the year due to a deterioration in copper prices and disruptions to production. The Boliden Area's higher profit is primarily due to a higher milled volume resulting from systematic improvement work in the concentrator. Improved metal prices also had a positive effect on the

profit. At Garpenberg, 2016 was the first year of operating at full production capacity in the new facilities. The substantial improvement in the profit was due to higher milled volume and improvements in the zinc price. Kevitsa, which was acquired during the year, was consolidated on 1 June 2016. Kylylahti's increase in milled volume was unable to compensate for lower copper prices, higher operating costs, and depreciation. Tara's operating profit increased, mainly due to improvements in metal prices but also as a result of a higher milled volume. The profit was affected by items affecting comparability in relation to the adjustment of pensions and totalling SEK 248 m (227).
Mines' operating costs before depreciation totalled SEK 6,833 m (5,842), corresponding to an increase in local currencies of 20%. Adjusted for Kevitsa, costs increased by 7% in local currencies with the increase primarily due to higher levels of mined production.
Depreciation increased to SEK 3,172 m (2,520)

due to the Kevitsa acquisition, to higher mined production levels, and to the fact that production at Aitik took place in capital-intensive areas.
Investments, excluding acquisitions, increased to SEK 2,755 m (2,394).
Production
Milled volume and production of metal in concentrate increased due to the acquisition of Kevitsa and to higher levels of production in several mining areas.
Aitik's production continued to be negatively affected by low crusher availability, and the milled volume totalled 36 Mtonnes (36). Production of copper in concentrate increased, however, due to a higher copper grade, 0.22% (0.21). Construction of the new crusher station, which is scheduled to come on line in 2018, is continuing.
Milled volume in the Boliden Area increased to 2,138 ktonnes (1,879), primarily due to systematic

improvement work in the concentrator. The higher milled volume resulted in increases in the production of all metals in concentrate.
Garpenberg's expansion resulted in an increase in milled volume to 2,622 ktonnes (2,367), compensating for lower grades. High levels of stability in the concentrator resulted in a high zinc recovery level.
Kevitsa was acquired on 1 June 2016 and production developed well.
Kylylahti's milled volume achieved record high levels due to systematic improvement work, totalling 797 ktonnes (733). The higher milled volume resulted in increased production of both copper and gold in concentrate.
The action programme at Tara launched in 2014 has yielded the desired results and the milled volume increased to 2,603 ktonnes (2,197). Production of zinc and lead in concentrate consequently also increased.

Comments
Copper. The acquisition of Kevitsa, together, primarily, with higher production at Aitik, resulted in an increase in the production of copper in concentrate. Zinc. Production of zinc in concentrate increased due to the higher milled volume at Tara and to an increase in milled volume and grade in the Boliden Area. Nickel. The Kevitsa acquisition added nickel to Mines' metals. Gold. The increase in the production of gold in concentrate was mainly due to the acquisition of Kevitsa and to increased production in the Boliden Area. Silver. The increase in the production of silver in concentrate was due to higher milled volumes in the Boliden Area and at Garpenberg. Lead. Production of lead in concentrate remained on a par with last year.

BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS

Smelters' flexibility ensures competitiveness

Boliden's smelters enjoy strong market positions due to advanced technical know-how, flexible smelting processes, and the ability to produce high quality metals from complex metal concentrates and recycled raw materials.

Boliden's smelters are working to enhance their efficiency and growth on the basis of sustainability and responsibility with regard to safety, the environment, and health. The Business Area has three strategic focus areas and has launched a number of related development projects during the year.
Improved operational efficiency will be achieved through increased process stability, higher recovery levels, and lower costs. Efficient maintenance work, longer intervals between maintenance shutdowns, and increased zinc capacity at Odda are all examples of this approach.
The smelters are also working to increase their flexibility by developing the ability to process complex materials and compounds, and by identifying longterm solutions to waste management issues. Rönnskär and Odda are also investing in underground storage facilities for environmentally hazardous waste.

Maximised production of metals and by-products is enabled through diversification and a broader product portfolio, with the new business model for nickel at Harjavalta and silver extraction at Kokkola providing two examples of this approach.
Investments
Business Area Smelters invests in enhanced environmental performance and improvements to efficiency and flexibility in order to ensure its long-term competitiveness. A number of investments have been made in reducing the operations' environmental impact during the year, and the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant at Harjavalta, for example, will reduce sulphur dioxide emissions and enable future increases in production. The facility will come on line in 2019.

Streamlining Odda's zinc operations
Boliden reached an agreement to sell the independent Noralf operations at Odda to Fluorsid - an Italian company that is the market leader in aluminium fluoride - last autumn. The operations sold comprise the manufacture and sale of aluminium fluoride, which is used in the production of aluminium. The manufacturing process requires large amounts of sulphuric acid, which is a by-product of the smelter's zinc process. A long-term agreement was signed at the same time for the sale of sulphuric acid. The sale supports Boliden's strategy of streamlining the zinc operations at Odda and expanding production to 200 ktonnes per year by the second quarter of 2017.

Introduction

Market

Operations

Corporate Governance

Financial reports BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS

Boliden's acquisition of the Kevitsa mine in northern Finland means that Harjavalta now has a stable base supply of nickel concentrate.

Further development of the nickel operations

In 2015, Boliden changed its business model for Harjavalta's nickel smelting. 2016 saw the desired results in the form of increased profitability and an expanded product portfolio thanks to the new business model whereby Boliden buys its own nickel concentrate and produces nickel matte for sale to external customers, rather than smelting nickel concentrate on behalf of customers.
Boliden's acquisition of the Kevitsa mine in

northern Finland means that Harjavalta has now secured a stable base supply of nickel concentrate, enabling improved long-term planning of the smelter's raw material mix and production. Harjavalta's nickel operations are strongly positioned, with logistical advantages such as greater proximity to ports than many other nickel smelters. The nickel smelter also has low sulphur dioxide emissions per tonne produced.

Treatment project reduces discharges

Automation ensures safety and efficiency

80%%
The new granulation water treatment plant at Rönnskär is expected to reduce metal discharges by up to 80%.

A new treatment plant for granulation water at Rönnskär came into operation in the summer. The treatment plant is equipped with the best possible technology and is an important environmental investment that will substantially reduce the smelter's discharges. The treatment process captures the particles in a ceramic filter with an extremely high filtration capacity, and zinc discharges are consequently expected to be reduced by approx. 80%, while copper and nickel discharges will be reduced by 75%, and lead and arsenic discharges will be halved. A new gas treatment system with dioxin filters will come on line in 2017.

The automation of heavy, manual jobs has continued in 2016 with the aim of improving the work environment and enhancing both safety and efficiency. The cooling elements used in Odda's and Bergsöe's casting of lead ingots are now cleaned completely automatically with the help of robots. Weighing, labelling, and shrink-wrapping equipment have now also been automated.

Recycling
Unique, energy-efficient technology have made the Rönnskär smelter one of the world's leading operators in the field of recycling copper and precious metals from electronic scrap. The Bergsöe lead smelter is one of Europe's biggest lead recyclers. Synergies between Boliden's smelters and mines also enables metals to be recycled from waste products from in-house processes, enabling Boliden to maximise the value of incoming raw materials.

Efficiency
The prices of Boliden's metal products are set on global metal exchanges. Therefore Boliden's competitiveness depends on having stable and efficient processes, high recovery levels and low costs. Boliden is, for example, working to enhance the efficiency of its maintenance work and to increase its efficiency by means of Boliden's lean-based improvement programme, New Boliden Way.

Flexibility
Boliden's smelters have the ability to process complex raw materials, which offers competitive advantages and increases revenues while simultaneously increasing freedom of choice when it comes to the raw materials available in the market at any given time. The smelters have continued to develop their processes and technical competence during the year in order to enable further increases in flexibility. At the end of the year, for example, an investment that will increase Harjavalta's capacity to process nickel in copper concentrate was approved. Boliden is also investing large sums in waste management in order to be able to handle increasingly complex raw materials containing impurities.

Customised products
Boliden's product portfolio comprises the base metals, zinc, copper and nickel, together with lead, gold, silver and a number of by-products. Boliden also offers a number of different zinc alloys customised in line with different customers' requirements. The alloys enable the customers to create specific end product properties, cut costs, and increase productivity.

Treatment
The smelters' treatment processes are being developed to reduce Boliden's environmental impact. Stable processes with few stoppages are important in minimising emissions and discharges from production and. Rönnskär is building a new treatment plant for granulation water and a filter for dioxin treatment, while Kokkola is investing in expanding its water treatment capacity. The biggest single ongoing environmental investment is at Harjavalta, where a new sulphuric acid plant is being built.

Underground storage
Underground storage
Underground storage enables sustainable, permanent storage of certain types of waste, thereby enhancing the smelters' ability to optimise the raw material mix to make use of complex raw materials. At Odda, waste is deposited in rock caverns, while at Rönnskär, construction work is in progress on a storage facility 350m underground which will be in operation in 2020.

BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS

Financial information
Revenues totalled SEK 38,516 m (38,948) and the gross profit excluding revaluation of process inventory was SEK 9,376 m (9,167).
The operating profit, excluding revaluation of process inventory, increased to SEK 2,759 m (2,692). Adjusted for items affecting comparability totalling SEK 107 m, the operating profit excluding revaluation of process inventory was slightly lower. Increases in feed volumes and slight improvements in market terms were, however, unable to compensate for increases in costs and depreciation.
Including the inventory revaluation effect of SEK 588 m (-420), the operating profit totalled SEK 3,347 m (2,272). The operating profit was impacted by maintenance shutdowns to the tune of approx. SEK -260 m (-290), due to reduced production and higher costs.

Rönnskär's improved profit was due to improvements in market terms and to increased sales of by-products. The action programme that has been running since 2014 was wound up during the year and yielded the intended effects on the profit at the end of the year. The lower profits at Harjavalta, Kokkola, and Odda were mainly due to a deterioration in market terms. The profit was negatively affected not only by a fall in the price of sulphuric acid, but by a deterioration in treatment charge terms, mainly for the zinc smelters. Bergsöe's profit increased due to an increase in the price of lead and higher production levels.
The smelters' operating costs, excluding depreciation, totalled SEK 5,696 m (5,536). Costs increased in local currencies by 3% due, largely, to higher staff overheads and to costs caused by operational disruptions. The expansion investment at Odda contributed to the increase in depreciation.

The Business Area's investments for the year totalled SEK 1,372 m (1,248).
Production
The smelters' copper and lead production increased while gold production remained on par with levels of last year. Zinc and silver production fell.
Rönnskär's process stability improved and copper production increased slightly. A higher gold metal content in the raw materials resulted in increased gold production, while silver production fell due to changes in the raw material mix.
Harjavalta's copper and nickel processes were stable, resulting in high feed volumes and healthy production levels. A more comprehensive maintenance shutdown was conducted in 2015, which partially explains the increase in copper production. 2016 was the first full year of the new business model for nickel

introduced at the end of Q2 2015, and production of nickel matte consequently increased substantially in comparison with last year. The new business model has improved Harjavalta's position. Changes to the raw material mix resulted in a fall in the production of precious metals.
Kokkola's zinc production declined as a result of production disruptions in the latter half of the year and lower recovery levels. Silver extraction did, however, increase year on year.
Odda's zinc production in 2016 was the highest in the smelter's history and resulted from Odda's expansion to 200 ktonnes/year. The expansion project is proceeding according to plan.
Bergsöe's production of lead alloys reached record levels and was largely due to improvements in process stability.

Comments
Copper. Concentrate feed and copper production increased at Harjavalta. Concentrate feed decreased at Rönnskär while copper production increased slightly. Zinc. Concentrate feed and zinc production increased at Odda but fell at Kokkola. Nickel matte. Harjavalta's nickel matte production increased sharply in 2016, which was the first full year with the new nickel business model introduced at the end of Q2 2015. Gold. Gold production increased at Rönnskär and fell at Harjavalta. Silver. Silver production fell at both Rönnskär and Harjavalta.

Safety is a top priority within Boliden and the Group has an explicit zero tolerance for accidents. A strong safety culture, coupled with proactive risk prevention, will help ensure Boliden's success.
The number of serious accidents has decreased in most units during the year. The most common forms of incidents or accidents involve people stumbling, falling, or injuring their fingers when working with hand held tools.
In the majority of cases, the person returns to work within a day or so. The accident frequency (LTI) in 2016 was 7.9 (8.9) for Boliden employees, including contractors, corresponding to a year on year improvement of 12%.
Increasing the safety of contractors who work in and

around Boliden's facilities is a high priority issue. Seminars and training courses were held in 2016 to improve contractor integration and control, but in December, a fatal accident unfortunately occurred in conjunction with the transportation by a contractor of sulphuric acid between Harjavalta and Kokkola.
Work on behavioural-based safety training courses, increased involvement in safety work by managers, risk analyses, and expanded health and safety inspections, and proactive metrics for the control and following up of operations have begun yielding results in some areas of the operations. Boliden's efforts to create safe workplaces are increasingly focusing on proactive work to prevent accidents before they happen.

Boliden's underground mines have been equipped with wireless positioning systems that can localise machines and employees precisely. This facilitates maintenance work, and increases safety in conjunction with fires and other emergency situations.

5,477
Number of employees (FTE) 2016. An increase from last year's 4,878.

Healthy employees
Good healt is not just positive for the individual in question, it also promotes Boliden's success. The increasing sick leave trend was reversed in 2016, and the sick leave rate fell to 4.4% (4.6). Boliden's health work programme is based on continuous improvement and development. Local conditions will determine the nature of the work, but health-promoting activities such as sponsored exercise in employees' free time, spinal training, staff canteens that specialise in healthy food, and recurring smoking cessation campaigns are examples on what can be provided. Good health is also about effective rehabilitation measures designed to reduce long-term sick leave.

Securing tomorrow's talent pool
Boliden's ability to attract, develop and retain employees with the right skill sets and commitment levels is vital for our competitiveness and is consequently a top priority.
Our competence development and recruitment work is based on both Boliden's needs and the Group's strategic goals of promoting diversity and equal opportunities. The challenges we face include the fact that this is a male-dominated industry that operates in regions with a limited recruitment base, coupled with the stiff competition for engineers with specialist training. Boliden's operational units consequently all have their own strategic recruitment plans.

What Boliden offers its employees

A work-life balance

Efforts to improve awareness of Boliden amongst students at universities and colleges of further education continued during the year in order to help grow the recruitment base. In 2016, Boliden advanced to 33rd place in the "Nordic's Most Attractive Employers" survey of engineering students by the employer branding company, Universum. Boliden's efforts to clarify its Employer Value Proposition also continued, and largely involved clarifying what we have to offer, such as sustainable development, a life-work balance, technical innovation, and personal learning and development in the workplace.
Employee development
Boliden's staff turnover rate during the year was 5.9% (4.3). Low staff turnover rates help create stability but, at the same time, demands internal career and skill development in order to ensure that employees will stay with Boliden and enjoy job satisfaction. Boliden has a number of internal programmes designed to create the preconditions for career and skill development. Encouraging mobility within the Group and prioritising internal recruitment for the talent and managerial pool also generates career opportunities for existing employees. Meetings with management, known as Talent Forums ­ designed to identify talents and offer skill development with a view to improving leadership ability ­ are held every year.
Diversity and equal opportunities
Diversity leads to dynamism, creativity and, ultimately, to greater profitability. Boliden endeavours to ensure its workforce is made up of people with different backgrounds, ages, and experiences. During the year Boliden continued to work with the Swedish Public Employment Service to identify solutions for refugees with academic backgrounds. Attracting female employees to a traditionally male-dominated industry is a challenge for Boliden, but our target is for at least 20% of the workforce to be made up of women by the end of 2018. By the end of 2016, the percentage was 17.8% (17.8). It is worth noting that amongst Boliden's so-called top 100 managers, the percentage of female employees is higher, at 26%.

My Opinion
Boliden offers a work environment that ensures a work-life balance as a prerequisite for successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. It is important to create an organisation in which employees have the skills, the will, and the ability to develop. The My Opinion employee survey is carried out every other year and measures Boliden's performance. The results from 2016 showed that the work situation, expressed in parameters such as job content and job satisfaction, had improved slightly since the previous survey in 2014. The dialogue between managers and employees has also improved, as well as management's involvement in safety at the workplace.

RANVEIG CAPJON
Focused efforts have cut the sick leave rate at Odda
Boliden's goal is for the sick leave rate to be 3% or less by 2018. The Odda smelter in Norway saw the sick leave rate increase in 2015 and the smelter decided that focused efforts aimed at bringing about an improvement was required.
"We started by following up on every employee who had more than 10 days of sick leave," says Odda's Administrative Manager, Ranveig Capjon. "The First Line Managers and HR meet every month to review all of the cases and put measures in place. These measures are then followed up at the subsequent meeting."
Boliden has a toolbox of measures available for use in this field: preventative safety work is very important, and Boliden also provides both safety equipment and training in safety issues.
"We try to create job satisfaction and encourage good management, close cooperation on important issues, and a good work-life balance, in order to reduce stress-related illnesses. We also encourage exercise and are trialling the use of a diet and exercise coach within the Group," says Ranveig.
If an employee falls ill, Boliden can make adjustments to shift times, duties, and equipment.
"The First Line Managers have an important part to play and we support them by providing training in psychology, communication, regulations, etc.," continues Ranveig.
And thanks to these focused efforts, Odda has managed to halve its sick leave rate over the course of just one year.
"We are delighted by the results and would like to thank our committed employees who have made this possible," says Ranveig.

JONAS WIIK
A whole world together in the exploration department
Boliden is in the middle of a generation shift and has a growing need for skilled employees. Our ambition is to have employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences, ages and gender.
Boliden's exploration department is a concrete expression of this aim, with some 130 geologists, geophysicists, field technicians, development engineers, geodata technicians, etc., all working together to secure the availability of new deposits. These employees come from 13 different countries, have an average age of 40, and 29% of the workforce is made up of women.
"The diversity helps ensure a real breadth of knowledge and experience when it comes to bedrock, Mineral Resources, and methodologies. Diversity also creates an inspirational work environment and a more pleasant working climate," says Jonas Wiik, Boliden's Exploration Manager.
Boliden attracts skilled employees by participating in a variety of trade fairs worldwide and in labour market days at universities and high schools.
"We want to show both students and industry people that Boliden is a company at the leading edge of development, and that with us, they will get both a good working environment and a good work-life balance," says Jonas.
Shawn Dempsey from Canada is a good example of this. Shawn had previously worked as a geophysicist in Canada, but was keen to work abroad in order to expand his experience of base metal exploration with a major mining company. He has now been working for Boliden for 3.5 years and is responsible for geophysics in the Boliden Area and Ireland.

ENVIRONMENT

Active environmental work

Boliden's operations make use of land, consume large amounts of energy, and can have an impact on the surrounding area. Boliden consequently has a far-reaching responsibility to limit its environmental impact at every stage in the value chain, including reclamation work when a mine is decommissioned.

0.69
Boliden's carbon dioxide intensity is shown in tonnes CO2 per tonne of metal produced at each production unit. The carbon dioxide intensity is lower today than five years ago.

Boliden's environmental agenda
Environmental sustainability is a prerequisite for successful mines and smelters. Boliden endeavours to use the best available environmental technology developed both in-house and in partnership with leading technology suppliers. We allow equipment suppliers to use Boliden as a reference when rolling out technical solutions to others in the industry. Environmental improvement measures account for a comparatively large share of Boliden's capital investments, and the Group always evaluates the environmental benefit in relation to the economic input in order to prioritise the best projects. Boliden makes investments that yield substantial environmental benefits relative to the input, irrespective of external requirements, as part of our efforts to be an industry leader in this field.
Boliden's environmental impact
The operations require energy and this gives rise to direct or indirect carbon dioxide emissions. Boliden's metals are, however, crucial in terms of the switch to tomorrow's energy systems that are based on renewable energy. Solar and wind power both demand major upgrades to electricity transmission and energy storage, driving the need for copper and zinc. Electric vehicles and other forms of transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy also require large amounts of copper. The manufacture of metals for these types of use leads, in many cases, to net savings in greenhouse gas emissions. Mines can have a negative impact on the surroundings in the form of discharges to water, dust, noise and changes in the landscape. The effects of mines and smelters are most pronounced in

the immediate vicinity of the operations, but some effects are felt across wider regions in the form of, for example, acidification and increased eutrophication. Boliden places considerable emphasis on the treatment and control of discharges, energy saving, waste management and recycling issues. Value generation from our own by-products and waste products, and those of other companies, help create a more circular economy. Waste and spillage are always minimised in order to ensure optimum resource utilisation.
Water management and dam safety
Boliden's operations require large amounts of water. The primary environmental impact of discharges to water lies in the risk that the affected bodies of water and their beds are contaminated by foreign substances that may disturb their natural balance. By reusing the water and returning it to the processes, Boliden is able to reduce both its water withdrawal and its discharges.
Boliden is responsible for around 40 dam facilities that were either previously used, or are currently being used, to store tailings sand or other waste and for water processing. Boliden endeavours to minimise the impact it has on the surrounding area, both when developing dams, and during and after the dams' operating lives. Boliden complies with the mining industry's dam safety guidelines (GruvRIDAS) and supports the dam safety policy of the Swedish mining industry organisation, SveMin.
Forestry and land management
Access to land is fundamental in terms of Boliden's ability to carry out exploration and conduct mining operations. In order to promote environmentally responsible and economically sustainable use of its 20,000 hectares of forest, Boliden's forestry is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified which ensures that economic, environmental and social responsibility is applied to all aspects of the forestry operations.
Boliden aims in conjunction with all forestry-related activities, transportation and other activities in conjunction with it, to use input goods and consumables that are environmentally friendly and recyclable. Boliden has, on its own initiative, designated about 10% of its productive forested land as nature conservation areas, which is more than required for certification.

Description of the environmental impact

Events during the year

Boliden processes numerous waste products in order to create saleable products and to minimise the amount of waste sent to landfill. Mines and smelters generate waste comprising waste rock, tailings sand, slag, sludge and dust. Mine waste is normally handled within the producing unit, while smelter waste is either sent to internal or external landfills or for recycling.

· Construction of a deep storage facility for hazardous waste under Rönnskär continued in 2016. Construction work will be completed in 2020. · A landfill facility for waste is being built at Harjavalta. · The Skåne County Council decided to limit Bergsöe's storage and processing of large quantities of waste products. These quantities have been reduced, and the prohibition was lifted by a court ruling, although this has since been appealed. · Local authorities have classified Rönnskär's slag product, iron sand, as waste, which has clearly reduced its market. Boliden has contested this ruling and is now seeking a solution whereby slag products can be used in society to reduce the need for rock quarrying in conjunction with building and road construction, for example.

Mining and smelting processes consume large amounts of energy. Boliden shall reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by using renewable and/or recycled energy wherever possible. Boliden's carbon dioxide intensity shall be reduced through increases in process efficiency and increased electrification.

· Surplus heat at the smelters is used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It is estimated that 612 GWh (588) were used internally in 2016, with a further 877 GWh (898) supplied to external providers. · Renewable fuels are increasingly used in road transports, reducing the need for fossil fuels. · Bergsöe is building a facility for separating plastics out from raw materials and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

Boliden's most significant emissions to air comprise dust and sulphur dioxide from the smelters' process gases. Some diffuse emissions of dust arising from open materials handling, for example, are also generated. Boliden tracks emissions of metals to air particularly closely and aims to reduce them over time. Sulphur dioxide contributes to acidification and reducing these emissions is an important goal for Boliden.

· Rönnskär is investing in dioxin treatment in order to reduce
emissions.
· Kokkola has installed a new converter in order to reduce
SO2 emissions. · Kokkola has begun installing an electrofilter that will reduce
dust emissions.
· Investment in a new sulphuric acid plant that will reduce SO2 emissions has begun at Harjavalta.

Boliden's discharges to water primarily comprise metals and nitrogen. 84% (86) of the discharges of metal come from the smelters, while the mining operations account for 85% (83) of Boliden's nitrogen discharges. Returning water to the processes reduces both water withdrawal and discharges.

· Discharges of metals at Rönnskär have been reduced in 2016 through the use of new treatment techniques for granulation water. · Clearer quality goals for water discharged to recipients are being drawn up in order to control water management and reduce the risk of unplanned discharges.

The establishment of new mines and expansion of existing operations requires land utilisation. The physical impact on areas of land is often substantial, but Boliden's goal is to reduce the impact on biological diversity.

· As of 31 December 2016, Boliden owns and/or controls 22,600 hectares of land in the vicinity of existing or previous operations and in areas of interest for exploration. · Boliden works with ecological compensation, e.g. at Aitik.

Recycling metals

Boliden is one of the leading companies in the world when it comes to recycling electronics from scrap telephones and computers and is one of Europe's biggest recyclers of automotive batteries and the Group also processes a number of intermediate and waste products from the smelters in order to maximise me-

tal recovery levels. Synergies are achieved by directing materials to the facilities with the best technology for handling them. Any waste products sent to other countries are subject to legislation governing exports for landfill or recycling purposes. See also page 50.

Reclamation of land

For Boliden, reclamation of mining areas that are approaching the end of their lifespan is an ongoing process that is constantly under development. Boliden is collaborating with several research projects regarding the reclamation of sulphide-bearing materials and different types of ground and water covering. Ecological compensation and the preservation of biological diversity are high priorities. The goal is to use the best available technology and to document and follow up on the work carried out.

1.

Permits and operations: Boliden provides the authorities with financial security, guaranteeing reclamation, in conjunction with the licensing process for a mine, and makes provisions throughout the lifespan of the mine. Boliden conducts its operations in a way that facilitates reclamation and, where possible, initiates reclamation work while the mine is still operational.

2.

Reclamation planning: Boliden evaluates reclamation methods to determine those most suitable, both in conjunction with the mine's licensing process and while the mine is operational, produces environmental impact assessments, and draws up reclamation plans. The goal is for the reclamation work to last for a very long period of time indeed ­ over 1,000 years.

3.

Reclamation: Waste from mining operations comprises waste rock and tailings sand, which contain elevated levels of sulphides. The challenge, during reclamation, is to prevent oxygen from the air from reaching the waste rock and the tailings sand and thereby prevent weathering and the formation of acidic water. The reclamation work is carried out using a variety of methods, depending on local conditions, as illustrated below.

Boliden has a reclamation responsibility for some 30 active and decommissioned mines and conducts systematic monitoring and risk assessments for every object. Reclamation work has been carried out during the year at Gillervattnet (the Boliden Area) and in Laver (decommissioned operation), amongst others. At the end of 2016, a total of SEK 2,873 m (1,943) had been allocated for the reclamation of mining areas and smelters.

4.

Monitoring: Boliden monitors and follows up on the area over an extended period of time, at least 30 years, after reclamation work was completed, in order to be sure that the reclamation is working and to be able to react quickly if problems arise. Once Boliden has demonstrated that the reclamation has achieved its objective, the financial security is refunded to the company.

SOCIETY
A significant player in society

Boliden plays an important role in the communities and regions in which the Group's mines and smelters are located. Good relationships and mutual understanding are important components of our ability to conduct and develop our operations.

Boliden's job creation
Boliden is the biggest employer in many of the communities in which we operate. Boliden has a total of 5,500 employees in eight countries, who are directly employed by the Group. The cyclic sensitivity of the industry notwithstanding, Boliden has enjoyed stable employment rates over several economic cycles.
Many of Boliden's employees live in the vicinity of the workplace and the company consequently has a considerable impact on local employment levels and local trade and industry by generating increased purchasing power and providing a critical base for important social services. Boliden contributes to the creation of more than 25,300 job opportunities1), either directly or indirectly, through its subcontractors, suppliers, or the effect of its employees' expenditure. This means that for every one Boliden employee, an estimated four other jobs are created as a result of our operations. For additional details of job creation and other indirect economic impact, see Boliden's GRI Report.
Promoting the interests of local communities and maintaining good relationships with employees, neighbours, authorities and business partners is an important part of what it means to be a responsible

company and also facilitates our efforts to attract a skilled workforce and to develop our operations.
Contributing to tax revenues
Boliden also contributes to tax revenues in the regions in which the Group operates. The tax cost in 2016 totalled SEK 1,135 m, corresponding to a tax rate of 21.1%, but Boliden's direct tax expenditure also includes social security contributions, property tax, fuel tax, and VAT. Boliden's total contribution to public finances through taxes (direct, indirect, and induced) is estimated at SEK 11.5 billion.
Local sponsorships and partnerships
Local involvement in the form of support for and partnerships with voluntary organisations and associations are other ways in which Boliden can make a positive contribution in the areas in which the company operates. Boliden's support focuses primarily on local sporting and cultural events, schools and hospitals, often with links to children and young people. In 2016, Boliden's units sponsored local activities to the tune of approximately SEK 7 million.

Boliden on the world's first electric road

The world's first electric road for heavy trucks on public roads was opened in June 2016. A 2 km long stretch of the E16 highway outside Sandviken is the subject of the trial, which will run over a two year period.
Transporting freight to and from the Garpenberg mine will be possible via the electric road during the trial period. Boliden regards reducing its fuel consumption as a priority, in order to reduce its carbon footprint. One way of doing this is by increasing the degree of electrification of transports, both those inside Boliden's mining and industrial park areas, and

those that use public roads to ports and terminals. The electric road project outside Sandviken will provide valuable knowledge for Boliden's future ventures in this field.
Operators responsible for road upkeep, equipment suppliers, haulage firms, companies who transport goods by road, and authorities are all involved in the electric road project, which is being coordinated by Region Gävleborg. The principal financiers are the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Energy Agency, Vinnova, Scania and Siemens.

BUSINESS PARTNERS AND PURCHASING
Responsible business

Boliden's ambition is to be a responsible and credible business partner. Boliden buys raw materials, energy, services and equipment and since 2010, has a process designed to improve control of our supply chain and to increase transparency in the value chain.

Evaluation of business partners
Boliden's business partners are evaluated with regard to commercial and sustainability aspects based on the 10 principles of the UN's Global Compact and on ILO and ISO standards. Our Code of Conduct lays down principles and norms for responsible business. The same principles apply to all commercial relationships, whether Boliden is the buyer or the seller of raw materials, products and services.
Boliden's suppliers comprise both those who supply raw materials, and those who supply other goods and services. The majority of Boliden's copper is sold to industrial customers in Europe, primarily to manufacturers of copper wire, copper rods, and copper alloys. Boliden's zinc is mainly sold to producers of galvanised sheet and other galvanised products, and to the alloys industry. Boliden also, in addition to its base metals, sells a range of by-products in bulk to industrial customers.
Trading in materials and waste
Boliden complies with national legislation and international guidelines such as the OECD guidelines

for trade in materials, waste and hazardous waste. For some years now, Boliden has, in order to avoid the risk of dumping hazardous waste, been implementing a strict internal policy regarding such transactions whereby payment is not made until the waste processing operator produces documentation demonstrating that the material has been processed.
No conflict minerals
Boliden's policy is that no concentrates or secondary raw materials shall be acquired from areas of armed conflict. The secondary raw materials are, however, more difficult to control, as metals may have been recycled multiple times and may have been passed through several links in the supply chain before reaching Boliden's smelters.
Boliden's smelters are included in the "The London Good Delivery list of Acceptable Refiners". Boliden must, in order to ensure its continued inclusion in the London Bullion Market Association's (LBMA) list of recommended gold producers, ensure that the raw materials chain complies with a number of ethical criteria and with stringent transparency requirements. Boliden's reporting to the LBMA is verified by KPMG.

2016
In 2016, Boliden's purchasing and sales staff have completed training courses in business ethics, social justice, and environmental issues that affect our supply chain. An improved methodology and system support mechanism have been introduced in order to further enhance the efficiency of the supplier evaluation process. Just over 100 business partners completed a self-evaluation process, which is a tool used to evaluate the work in areas that Boliden has identified as being of particular importance. The aim is to develop and improve the sustainability work of all parties.
On-site visits and audits are carried out in special cases and any deviations and measures implemented are followed up. A total of 11 (19) such visits were carried out during the year, 5 (3) of which were audits. Business partners that fail to live up to our requirements are expected to draw up an action plan showing how these requirements will be met in future.

Boliden's purchasing volume is divided into strategic categories. Efficient work on contracting as much of the purchases as possible and on securing valid agreements made 2016 a peak year in terms of purchase volume addressed. The Finnish mines' suppliers have been integrated into Boliden's overall supplier base, resulting in significant synergies. Other focus areas included shortened lead times, delivery performance, and the development of supply operations.

PURCHASING CATEGORIES
Boliden has, after the integration of the Finnish mines, a total of 7,300 suppliers, 200 of which account for 80% of the purchasing volume. The purchasing volume, excluding concentrate purchases, totalled SEK 12.3 billion, with Mines accounting for 56% (55) of the total purchasing volume and Smelters for 44% (45). Purchasing prices fell slightly overall for the Group in 2016, despite a sharply rising USD. The effects of the fall in the price of petrochemical products is now being noticed, and the efforts to increase competition and consolidation have had a substantial impact.

Category

Description and market trends

Boliden's price trend, 2016

Services

The market development for services follows the inflation in the countries in question.

Continued consolidation and focus on improved contractor safety, increased competition and contract compliance.

Bulk goods & chemicals

The category is largely steered by market indices. Prices have fallen for chemicals, explosives, and input goods, but petrochemical product prices rose once more towards the end of the year.

Boliden has benefited from long-term contracts in areas experiencing upturns. Good competition for lime and explosives, for example, has resulted in considerable reductions in costs.

Electricity

The price of electricity is driven by electricity consumption, availability of hydroelectric and nuclear power, the price of coal, emissions trading, transfer capacity, and taxes and political decisions.

Higher network tariffs and taxes have contributed a negative cost trend, but at the same time, renewable electricity production has been subsidised. Overall, the price of electricity has fallen.

Logistics

The price of transport services has generally fallen due to lower fuel prices and excess capacity. Railways have opened up to competition in Finland, but the full effect of this has not been noticed in 2016.

Road and maritime transport costs have fallen as a result of lower fuel prices. An imbalance in the road transportation sector in Europe, coupled with the increase in intermodal transports (road/rail) have resulted in falling costs and a reduced environmental footprint for Boliden's transports.

Indirect materials & services

Manpower, travel, cleaning/decontamination, and consultancy services are affected by wage trends in the respective countries. Unchanged market prices and good competition.

Procurement of temporary personnel, security services, and corporate health care schemes have generated a lower cost level overall within the category.

IT & Telecoms

Costs are driven by technological development and competition. The price trend for hardware is falling, but the cost of services is relatively stable.

Costs have been affected by Boliden's technology decisions and the consolidation of IT systems. There was a clear downwards price trend in 2016, driven by good specifications and market trends.

Fixed equipment

Orders received by suppliers, primarily in the mine-related equipment sector, at low but stable level. Continued improvement regarding supplier consolidation.

Slightly lower costs and advantageous lead times during the year. Extensive focus on long-term agreements to increase quality and availability.

Mobile equipment

Orders received by suppliers at low level. This has resulted in increased competition and advantageous pricing.

Low raw material prices and good competition resulted in an unchanged price level for Boliden.

Tools &

Regional supplier base. Unchanged

consumables price trend driven by low raw material

prices.

Group-wide contracts for the range in this category contribute to competitive purchasing prices.

Electrical installations & equipment

Long-term supplier relationships with installed base. The market is balanced.

Pricing picture unchanged. Suppliers who have failed to meet Boliden's work environment and CSR requirements have been shed during the year.

The price of the Boliden share rose by 66%, in contrast to the OMX Stockholm 30 index and the Euromoney Global Mining Index in SEK, which rose by 5% and 72%, respectively. Healthy production, coupled with a favourable metal price and exchange rate trend, contributed to the share's performance in 2016.
At the end of 2016, the Boliden share was quoted at

SEK 237.90 (142.90) on Nasdaq Stockholm, corresponding to a market capitalisation of SEK 65.1 b (39.1). In common with other raw materials companies, the variation in the value of the Boliden share is, on average, greater than for the broad stock market indices. The beta value of the Boliden share over the last five years against OMXSPI is 1.43.
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of SEK 5.25 (3.25) per share be paid for 2016, which is in line with Boliden's dividend policy. The proposed dividend corresponds to 33.9% (33.7) of the net earnings per share and a dividend yield of 2.2% (2.3), calculated on the basis of the share price at the end of the year.
The Boliden share's total return (the sum of the dividend paid and the price trend) over the most recent 10-year period was, on average, 7% per annum.
Share capital
There are a total of 273,511,169 Boliden shares. Every share has a nominal value of SEK 2.12 and the share capital totals SEK 578,914,338. Boliden's share capital comprises a single class of share in which

RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management
Boliden's operations are cyclically sensitive and are exposed to fluctuations in metal prices and exchange rates. The operations have an impact on the surrounding environment and many processes are associated with work environment and safety risks. Boliden works unceasingly to reduce these risks, e.g. through scenario planning based on a range of different market fluctuations.

Operational risks
Operational risks are managed by the operating units in accordance with the guidelines and instructions established for each Business Area and unit.

Risk Health and safety

Description of risk
Boliden handles large material flows, both below and above ground. Employees and contractors are periodically exposed to heavy machinery and lifting, to high temperatures, and to substances that are hazardous to health. Deviations from established routines or inadequate maintenance can give rise to dangerous situations and the risk of personal injury. The risk of serious accidents that can result in personal injury and, in a worst case scenario, fatalities, must be minimised. The sick leave trend has previously been a rising one, resulting in poor health and the risk of accidents, but this trend was reversed in 2016.

Management and comments for the year
Boliden has well-established health and safety routines, with a clear zero tolerance vision. The number of accidents resulting in lost time (LTI), including those suffered by contractors, fell, year on year, and totalled 7.9 (8.9).
Work on Boliden's safety culture has continued during the year and is based on employee involvement and commitment. Progress has been made in the majority of units. The work has focused on routines relating to preventative safety and risk management work and on reducing the number of accidents among contractors and suppliers.
A number of training programmes aimed at increasing awareness of ill health have been conducted. New work environment rules governing organisational and social work environment will result in additional training programmes.

Environmental impact
Unplanned stoppages Talent pool

Environmental impact Boliden's operations affect the air, water, land and biological diversity in the vicinity of those operations. The extraction of metals also gives rise to waste products that must be processed safely. The risk is posed by both the ongoing and decommissioned operations.
Carbon dioxide emissions Boliden's operations are energy-intensive and result in carbon dioxide emissions that can impact climate change. The EU's ETS emissions trading scheme also has an economic effect, the importance of which may grow, both in the form of direct emission costs and also, to a considerable degree, in the form of indirect emission costs that may result in increases in electricity prices.
Water management and dam safety Tailings ponds account for one of the risk scenarios for the mining industry. The risks comprise both the environmental impact of dam construction and the risk of a dam failure. Extreme weather conditions increase this risk.

Boliden sets emission goals and monitors them closely. Efforts to manage the risk of emissions and discharges are based on risk analyses, ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Technological development aimed at ensuring optimum resource utilisation and minimizing potential waste volumes is an ongoing process.
Boliden's goal is to ensure that its carbon dioxide intensity does not exceed 0.77 tonnes/tonne of metal produced. Carbon intensity increased in 2016 from 0.65 to 0.69 due to the acquisition of operations in Finland which have a larger indirect CO2 burden than the average for Boliden's electricity supply, which comes mainly from hydroelectricity and nuclear power. Boliden works, through its industry organisations, to promote transparency in the Emissions Trading Scheme and to ensure that competitive industries are compensated for indirect emission costs as in many competing countries.
Boliden develops water balance models to ensure better resource utilisation and to create a wider safety margin in relation to overflows and emergency water discharge. Every operating unit with its own dam has a Dam Safety Manager and a Dam Operations Manager. The dams are operated in accordance with the GruvRIDAS dam safety guidelines.

Boliden's production essentially comprises continuous processes and unplanned stoppages can affect production, emissions and discharges to air and water, and financial results. The stoppages can be long-term. Unplanned stoppages can, for example, occur due to technical problems, accidents or strikes.

Boliden carries out preventative maintenance work at all of its production facilities. Major maintenance shutdowns are carried out every year within the smelting operations, while maintenance work is an integral part of the day-to-day operations for the mines. Boliden has adopted a zero tolerance vision for accidents in order to help prevent unplanned stoppages.

A large number of Boliden's employees will retire over the next few years. A shortage of people with the right experience increases the difficulty of recruitment.

Boliden has established methods of evaluating employees and succession planning. Talent Forums are held at all units to ensure that the right expertise is available in the right key positions. Middle management programmes are conducted annually, as are employer branding activities. Boliden has made an unchanged number of visits to universities and trade fairs in Sweden during the year, while the number of activities in Finland has increased. The results of external surveys show that the "young professionals" group (professionally active people 1-8 years after graduation) view working at Boliden in an increasingly positive light. Boliden's equal opportunities work has been noticed. One example of this is Women at Work ­ a network for women who are interested in career development.

Introduction

Market

Operations

Corporate Governance

Financial reports RISK MANAGEMENT

Market and commercial risks
Boliden's market and commercial risks are primarily managed within the individual Business Areas and at Group level.

Risk Metal prices

Description of risk
Changes to metal prices have a significant impact on Boliden's profits and cash flow.

Management and comments for the year
Boliden's policy is not to hedge metal prices, but rather to allow changes to be reflected in the result. There are some exceptions to this, e.g. when mining ore bodies with short residual lifespans or in conjunction with major investment projects. See also under the "Financial risks" section. Boliden also continuously hedges Smelters' metal price and currency exposure during the period between the purchase of materials and the sale of corresponding metals (with the exception of process inventory) in what is known as transaction exposure. See also under the "Financial risks" section.

Treatment and refining charges

Treatment and refining charges make up a large part of the smelters' gross profit and are determined by the supply/ demand of metal concentrates.

The terms are negotiated annually by the major players in the mining and smelting industries. Boliden generally applies these terms internally and the majority of external contracts are based on these terms.

Customers

Boliden has a reliance on a small number of large copper customers. Reduced sales to industrial customers in Europe increase the risk of sales via the London Metal Exchange (LME), with slightly lower margins as a result.

Boliden endeavours to reduce the risks by expanding the customer portfolio through its own northern European sales organisation. Boliden has a diversified customer portfolio and a few new customers have also been added during the year. Boliden also has plans in place that would enable the production to be reorganised to produce LME-quality products that can be sold via LME.

Raw materials supply
Energy prices

A stable and reliable raw materials supply is important in enabling the smelters to produce at high levels of capacity utilisation and consistent quality.

Boliden endeavours to conclude long-term agreements and partnerships with reliable external metal concentrate and recycling materials suppliers.

Energy accounts for approximately 14% of operating costs and changes in energy prices can have a significant effect on profitability.

Boliden's electricity policy entails a combination of spot prices and futures. Norway and Sweden have longer pricing agreements than Finland and Ireland. At the same time, Boliden monitors the potential for entering into longer term pricing agreements if favourable terms are offered. The EU's climate vision is giving rise to substantial investments in renewable and subsidised power generation, which can be expected to result in increased pricing volatility.

Financial risks
Boliden has a centralised treasury function that is responsible for managing financial risks with the exception of credit risks in accounts receivable. The treasury function is tasked with supporting the management and operating units at Parent Company and Group level. This structure ensures good internal risk monitoring and offers both financial and administrative economies of scale. The treasury function is responsible for identifying and limiting the Group's financial risks in line with the financial policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

Risk

Description of risk

Exchange rate and metal price risk

Exchange rate and metal price risks

The pricing terms for Boliden's products are primarily determined on raw materials exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) for base metals, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) for precious metals, and the currency and money market. Boliden's products are largely priced in USD and fluctuations in the USD/SEK/EUR exchange rates hence have a significant impact on Boliden's profits and cash flow. The Group's exchange rate and metal price exposure covers transaction exposure and translation exposure:
Transaction exposure Boliden's transaction exposure comprises both binding undertakings and forecast cash flows.
Exposure in connection with binding undertakings This exposure arises when Boliden undertakes to participate in a transaction at a fixed value and which is not compensated for by a simultaneous opposite transaction of a corresponding size and nature. The Group buys metals in the form of raw materials which it processes into refined metals, and where the acquisition value of the raw materials as well as the exchange rates may differ from the final sales value. Such differences arise as a result of variations in size, purchasing date, processing and selling. Furthermore, some customers receive fixed prices in different currencies that are sometimes set well in advance of delivery.
Exposure in connection with forecast cash flows This exposure arises due to the fact that a substantial percentage of the Group's future income ­ primarily that relating to extracted metals and to treatment and refining charges ­ is affected by fluctuations in metal prices and exchange rates.

The Group's total sensitivity to the factors listed (see sensitivity analysis table below) is calculated on the basis of the quarterly reports detailing the Group companies' planned exposure resulting from metal production, exchange rates and interest. The effects of different market scenarios can be quantified on the basis of the information on sensitivity to market changes, and can then act as source data for the management of financial risks and be reported to the Board of Directors, management, and the market.
Transaction exposure in conjunction with binding undertakings is hedged with the exception of the smelters' process inventory. Exposure in conjunction with forecast cash flows is normally not hedged in line with Boliden's policy. See also the "Market and commercial risks" section above.
Boliden's policy stipulates that risks from exposure in conjunction with binding undertakings shall be hedged in full, with the exception of the smelters' process inventory. See also the "Market and commercial risks" section above. The Group uses futures contracts to ensure that the sale price and exchange rate correspond to those applicable in conjunction with the purchase of the raw material in question or with the signing of a sales agreement at a fixed price. Hedge accounting is applied to the futures contracts, thereby hedging the fair value in the Income Statement.
Boliden continuously calculates the way in which changes in metal and exchange rate markets will affect the Group's future financial position. See the sensitivity analysis of the operating profit table below. Boliden's policy is not to hedge metal prices and exchange rates in relation to the Group's future income under normal commercial conditions. Boliden can, however, in order to limit the risk in certain situations, hedge part of the forecast cash flows. There may be special justification in conjunction with, for example, major investments or investments in mines with a short lifespan for limiting the financial risks. The Group can use futures and options contracts to hedge metal prices and/or exchange rates for the cash flows from forecast metal sales. The derivatives are hedge accounted as cash flow hedging under Other comprehensive income. See page 56 for a sensitivity analysis of how the Other comprehensive income result is affected by a change in the value of financial derivatives (cash flow hedging).

RISK MANAGEMENT

FINANCIAL RISKS, CONT.

Risk

Description of risk

Exchange rate risk

Translation exposure A translation difference arises when converting net investments in overseas operations into Swedish kronor, in conjunction with exchange rate fluctuations, which affects Other comprehensive income within the Group.

Interest rate risk

Changes in market interest rates affect the Group's profits and cash flows. The rapidity with which a change in interest rate levels affects the Group's net financial items depends on the fixed interest term of the loans.

Management and comments for the year
The effect of translation exposure is, in accordance with Boliden's financial policy, not eliminated ("equity hedging"). If external borrowing requirements within the Group exceed internal loans, the excess share of the borrowing currency is steered such that the currencies in the assets match. The main borrowing currencies are EUR, SEK and NOK.
Boliden's financial policy provides the scope for an average fixed interest term of up to 3 years. The Group's loan portfolio had, on 31 December 2016, an average fixed interest term of 0.1 years (0.5). Interest swaps are used to extend the fixed interest term.

Sensitivity analysis

Operating profit, excluding outstanding derivatives: the table below contains an estimation of the effect on the Group's operating profit of changes in market terms for the following year. The calculation is based on closing day prices on 31 December 2016 and on Boliden's planned production volumes. The sensitivity analysis does not take into account the effects of metal price hedging, exchange rate hedging, contracted treatment and refining charges, or the revaluation of smelters' process inventory.

Other comprehensive income, taking into account outstanding derivatives: the table below contains an estimation of the effect on the Other comprehensive income (income and cost items including reclassification adjustments not reported under the profit), before tax, of changes in the value of outstanding derivatives based on the closing day prices on 31 December 2016. Changes in the value of financial derivatives in respect of binding undertakings and translation exposure have a very limited or no effect net on the profit or Other comprehensive income. The table below hence contains the effect of changes in the value of derivatives intended to counter the Group's forecast exposure.

Operations

Financial reports RISK MANAGEMENT

FINANCIAL RISKS, CONT.

Risk
Refinancing and liquidity risk

Description of risk
The risk that Boliden will be unable to obtain the requisite financing or to meet its payment undertakings due to insufficient liquidity.

Management and comments for the year
Boliden limits the refinancing risk by ensuring that its loan liability has a good spread in terms of counterparties, financing sources and durations. Boliden works actively to ensure satisfactory current liquidity by making appropriate use of unutilised credit facilities with market- and operations-adjusted loan durations. The refinancing requirement is reviewed regularly by Boliden's treasury function. The refinancing requirement is dependent, first and foremost, on market trends and investment plans. The loan agreements carry loan covenants which oblige Boliden to comply with certain defined key ratio conditions in order to avoid early repayment. A deterioration in the global economic climate may entail increased risks in respect of profit performance and financial position, and the risk of Boliden coming into conflict with loan terms and conditions. Boliden has complied with all loan covenants in 2016.
The average term of total loan facilities was 3.3 years (2.4) at the end of the year, which is in accordance with established Group policy. On 31 December 2016, Boliden's payment capacity totalled SEK 6,968 m (6,514) in liquid assets and unutilised binding credit facilities with a term in excess of one year. Boliden has a cash pool structure that enables it to maintain a central overview of liquidity flows and ensures efficient management of the Group's liquidity.

Credit and counterparty risk

Credit risks in financial operations The term, credit and counterparty risk, refers to the risk that a counterparty in a transaction may fail to fulfil their obligation, thus causing the Group to incur a loss. Boliden's financial exposure to counterparty risk mainly occurs when trading in derivative instruments.
Credit risks in accounts receivable The risk of the Group's customers failing to fulfil their obligations constitutes a credit risk.

Boliden's financial policy mandates a Standard & Poor's credit rating of A when entering into a transaction, and a maximum investment of liquid assets per counterparty. The credit quality and counterparty spread for derivatives is adjudged to have been good in 2016. One of Boliden's financial counterparties had a BBB+ credit rating and hence failed to comply with the financial policy's limit guidelines, which has been addressed by the Board. On 31 December 2016, the credit risk in derivative instruments corresponded to a market value of SEK 298 m (264), which relates to Boliden's receivables from external counterparties.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities is regulated under ISDA agreements (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) which handle both offsetting between contracted counterparties during day-to-day operations and in conjunction with special circumstances, such as failure to pay. Boliden, during the course of its day-to-day operations, net reports market values in the same currency with a single counterparty that mature at the same time and the excess sum is paid by the party with the biggest liability. In the event of a breach of contract, all outstanding obligations covered by ISDA agreements are terminated. The outstanding sum in the majority of ISDA agreements is paid by the counterparty with the biggest liability.
Credit risks are managed through an established credit rating process, active credit monitoring, short credit periods, and daily routines for monitoring payments. The requisite provisions for bad debts are also monitored continuously. The quality of accounts receivable is deemed to be good. Write-downs of outstanding accounts receivable on 31 December 2016 have only been effected in very limited amounts and have also, historically speaking, been insignificant. See also Note 19, Accounts receivable. Credit insurance is also used from time to time.

Risk management and insurance

The risk of damage or injuries that give rise to financial losses.

The objective of the Risk Management function at Boliden is to minimise the total cost of the Group's damage and injury risks. This is achieved both by continuously enhancing the damage and injury prevention and control work conducted within the operations, and by introducing and developing Group-wide insurance solutions.

Financial reporting The risk of inaccurate financial and operational reporting.

Boliden has an efficient internal control structure. Control functions exist both locally, in individual units, and within Business Areas and at the Head Office. All of the functions work within a Group-wide internal control framework for financial reporting that is based on COSO. The framework's controls are tested annually, both internally and by external auditors. The operational reporting is followed up and controlled by the Group's Controller function, which works closely with the local units and Business Areas.

Other risks

Risk Legal risks

Description of risk
Boliden's various operations are widely subject to licensing requirements and to wide-ranging environmental and other regulations. Boliden may become involved in disputes and legal proceedings.

Management and comments for the year
The continuation of Boliden's operations is, to a large degree, dependent on the retention/renewal of existing licences and the acquisition of new ones. Boliden continuously monitors legal developments in relevant spheres and implements, follows up on and ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Boliden is active in the environmental law sphere, amongst others, through its membership of industry and trade associations, in the form of lobbying activities, and by means of presentations and educational measures for decision-makers and other stakeholder groups.
Information on legal proceedings and disputes is provided in Note 30.

Political risks

Political decisions can have an effect in Sweden and the countries in which Boliden and Boliden's commercial partners operate.

Boliden and industry organisations are often an expert body to which reports are referred for comment ahead of impending political decisions that impact Boliden's operations.

Risks to confidence

Boliden may suffer incidents that adversely affect confidence in the company, when, for example, suppliers, customers and/or employees fail to live up to the environmental, quality, ethical etc. requirements adhered to by Boliden.

Boliden has updated its routines for ensuring that customers and suppliers comply with the requirements imposed by Boliden in 2016. This work has taken the form of improved internal processes, training, and the acquisition of systems for evaluating business partners, together with so-called sanctions monitoring of companies and individuals linked to companies. A number of customer and supplier audits have been carried out to ensure a level that is within the framework of Boliden's requirement structure.
Boliden has also updated its crisis management system at all units during the year. The Group's crisis management group and its routines for handling crises, including internal and external communication and legal assistance, have also been updated.

Boliden Annual Report 2016 | 57

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Corporate Governance Report

Comments from the Chairman of the Board
Efficient corporate governance is a prerequisite for generating added value for our shareholders and maintaining confidence amongst our stakeholders at large.
A group, essentially comprising Swedish institutional investors, have held their shareholding and been long-term owners in Boliden since we were relisted in Sweden 15 years ago and the last few years have seen their ranks joined by a number of large, foreign, institutional owners. There is no clear principal owner, however, and this places special demands on the Board as the owners' ambitions must be "interpreted".
We work in an industry that is characterised by high volatility, i.e. rapid and vigorous fluctuations ­ both up and down ­ in profits, and this is something that our shareholders must understand. The volatility also makes significant demands on the company's management and Board in terms of their ability to provide high quality, transparent information and to handle these rapid changes without suffering either from hubris when the trend is upwards or dejection when the trend is downwards.
The Board of Directors and the management must, at the same time, successfully handle large and long-term investment projects, such as the acquisition of the Kevitsa copper/nickel mine in northern Finland. The decision to invest approximately SEK 6 billion in this project was taken by the Board in March 2016. This type of project naturally also entails a large number of risks, which are discussed over a relatively long period of time by the Board before any decision is taken, but is nevertheless vital in terms of the company's ability to generate value.
One of the prerequisites for value-generating work by the Board is that the Board has a firm grasp on the operations and on events in the outside world. We achieve this by, amongst other things, monthly reports and a well-structured body of material for the Board. We also usually visit two of Boliden's operating facilities each year in order to learn about those operations in real depth and to meet with the local management and employees.
In addition, in order to ensure that we spend sufficient time on the more long-term and strategic issues, we agree every year on a number of themes that we incorporate into our Board agenda. The Corporate Governance Report details the themes we have addressed during the past year. Some of them are recurring themes, e.g. CSR issues, which we address specifically at our October meeting, and leadership development, which is the focus of our December meeting.
The evaluation of the Board's work that we carried out in 2016 shows that the Board is functioning efficiently. This evaluation forms the basis for the work of the Nomination Committee and it is an important tool for the Board's efforts to ensure continuous improvement in our work.
February 2017 Anders Ullberg Chairman of the Board

Governance of the Boliden Group
Boliden is a Swedish limited company listed on the NASDAQ Stockholm Stock Exchange (NASDAQ Stockholm). The Boliden Group has approximately 5,500 employees and runs mines and smelters in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Ireland.
Boliden's corporate governance is based on the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Companies Act, NASDAQ Stockholm's regulations for issuers, the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance, and other applicable legislation and regulations.
In addition to compliance with rules and regulations, Boliden applies internal governance instruments, such as the Group's organisational and operational philosophy, the New Boliden Way, and Boliden's internal control tool, the Boliden Internal Control System (BICS), together with policies in a number of areas such as Boliden's Code of Conduct with which all employees must be familiar and in accordance with which they must conduct themselves. The Group's units also work in accordance with health & safety, environmental, energy, and quality management systems.
Highlights and events during 2016
Boliden acquired the Kevitsa nickel and copper mine in northern Finland from the mining company, First Quantum, in 2016. The acquisition is in line with Boliden's strategy and enables growth via a high quality mine with a long lifespan. The acquisition also contributes to the supply of raw materials for nickel production at the Harjavalta smelter. Another important event during the year was the focusing of operations at the Odda zinc smelter through the divestment of its aluminium fluoride manufacturing operations. A decision to invest in a new crusher station at Aitik and to upgrade existing crushers was also approved. A number of investments have also been made in environmental improvement measures.
Shareholders and Annual General Meeting
Boliden's biggest shareholders are Swedish and foreign investment funds and institutions. There were a total of 69,048 (71,337) shareholders at the end of the year and the single largest shareholders were Norges Bank and BlackRock. The percentage of foreign ownership reached approximately 67% (70) by the end of the year. See pages 52­53 of the Annual Report and Boliden's website for further information on the shareholder structure within Boliden.
Boliden's shareholders exercise their right of decision by submitting proposals to and participating in and voting on the proposals submitted to the Annual General Meeting and any Extraordinary General Meetings. Shareholders may request that a matter be discussed at the Annual General Meeting by submitting a written request to the Board of Directors at the designated time that is sufficiently in advance of the meeting that the matter can be included in the notice convening the meeting. Shareholders are

also welcome to submit enquiries to the Board and the President, the Auditor or Committee Chairmen during the General Meeting.
The Annual General Meeting is the company's supreme decision-making body. The duties of the Annual General Meeting include the election of Members of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, auditors, and the Nomination Committee. The Annual General Meeting's duties also include the adoption of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet, resolutions on the appropriation of profits and discharge from liability for the Members of the Board and the President of the company, the determination of fees payable to the Members of the Board and to the auditors and the principles governing conditions of employment and remuneration for the President and senior executives, and, where relevant, the amending of Articles of Association.
The Annual General Meetings are regularly held at one of Boliden's facilities in Sweden in order to give the shareholders an insight into the operations. Shareholders are offered the chance of a guided tour of Boliden's mines, concentrators or smelters in conjunction with these meetings in order to deepen their knowledge of the operations and to give them an opportunity to meet with Boliden's employees.
The 2016 Annual General Meeting
The 2016 Annual General Meeting was held on 3 May in Rönnskär. 104,698,900 shares were represented at the Meeting by 1,033 shareholders, either in person or through their proxies. The shares represented comprised 38.3% of the total number of shares. The Meeting was attended by all Members of the Board and members of the Group management, and the auditor.
The Meeting resolved, amongst other things, to re-elect all of the Members of the Board, with the exception of Staffan Bohman, who had declined re-election. Pekka Vauramo, President & CEO of Finnair and former Director of Sandvik Mining was elected as a new Member of the Board. Anders Ullberg was re-elected as the Chairman of the Board. The Meeting further resolved: · To pay a dividend of SEK 3.25 per share, totalling

The Annual General Meeting also resolved to approve the proposed principles for remuneration to the Group management whereby the remuneration shall comprise a fixed salary, any variable remuneration, other benefits and pensions. The variable remuneration shall be maximised at 60% of the fixed salary for the President and maximised at 40-50% of the fixed salary for other senior executives and shall be based on results in relation to targets set. The variable remuneration shall not entitle to pensionable income.
The resolutions passed by the 2016 Annual General Meeting are included in the Minutes of the Meeting published on Boliden's website, where the minutes of previous Annual General Meetings are also published.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee represents Boliden's shareholders and is tasked with preparing and presenting proposals for resolutions that Boliden's shareholders vote on at the Annual General Meeting. The proposals relate to the election of and fees payable to Board Members, the Chairman of the Board and the company's auditors, and to the process and the criteria that shall govern the appointment of the members of the Nomination Committee ahead of the next Annual General Meeting.
The focus of the Nomination Committee's work is on ensuring that the company's Board of Directors comprises Members who, collectively, possess the knowledge and experience that corresponds to the standards that Boliden's shareholders require of the company's most senior governing body. The Chairman of the Board accordingly presents the Nomination Committee with the evaluation conducted of the work of the Board and the individual Members during the past year as part of the process of drafting proposals for Board Members. The Company President also presents Boliden's operations and future orientation. The Nomination Committee is also afforded the opportunity to meet Members of the Board. The Nomination Committee also drafts proposals for the election of auditors. Shareholders can submit proposals to the Nomination Committee in accordance with the instructions presented on Boliden's website.
The Annual General Meeting passes resolutions on the principles governing the appointment and duties of the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee shall, in accordance with the Instructions for the Nomination Committee, comprise a minimum of five and a maximum of seven members.

of whom three shall represent the biggest shareholders and one the smaller shareholders, and one of whom shall be the Chairman of the Board. The Nomination Committee may, in order better to reflect the shareholder structure in the event of changes in ownership, offer places on the Committee to other larger shareholders. The Nomination Committee appoints its own Chairman and works in the best interests of all shareholders. The members of the Nomination Committee receive no remuneration for their work.
The work of the Nomination Committee in 2016
Jan Andersson (Swedbank Robur fonder), Lars Erik Forsgårdh, Ola Peter Gjessing (Norges Bank Investment Management), Anders Oscarsson (AMF) and Anders Ullberg (Chairman of the Board) were elected to the Nomination Committee at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. In October, the Chairman of the Board convened the members of the Committee, at which time, Jan Andersson was appointed Chairman of the Nomination Committee. The current composition of the Nomination Committee is also shown on Boliden's website. The Nomination Committee has met twice prior to the 2017 Annual General Meeting and has also had telephone contacts with and held meetings with both Members of the Board and the President. These contacts afford the Nomination Committee a good opportunity to form an opinion of the way in which the Chairman of the Board and the individual Members of the Board view the work of the Board, of the executive management, and of the way in which they view Boliden's operations and the challenges faced by the company in the next few years.
The Nomination Committee endeavours to ensure an even gender distribution amongst the Board Members and the Nomination Committee also prioritises, in parallel with its efforts to achieve this objective, ensuring a multifaceted and broad composition that covers relevant areas with regard to expertise, experience and background. Boliden's operations, developmental phase and future orientation are important criteria in evaluating skill requirements and analyses aimed at
60 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

determining the optimum composition of the Board. The Nomination Committee's proposals for
submission to the 2017 Annual General Meeting will be published in the impending notice convening the Annual General Meeting and on Boliden's website.
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is appointed by Boliden's owners to bear ultimate responsibility for the company's organisation and the management of the company's affairs in the best interests of both Boliden and the shareholders. This shall be done in a sustainable way that entails carefully balanced risk-taking, in order to ensure that the company's long-term developmental trend is a positive one.
Boliden's Board of Directors shall, under the provisions of the Articles of Association, comprise a minimum of three and a maximum of ten Members, without Deputy Members, elected by the Annual General Meeting. The company's employees have a statutory entitlement to appoint three Members and three Deputy Members to the Board. The Board of Directors, which is elected for one year at a time, has comprised eight Members elected by the Annual General Meeting and three Members appointed by the trade union organisations. The Board Meetings are attended both by the ordinary Members and by the unions' three Deputy Members. The General Counsel Group Legal Affairs is the Board's Secretary. Boliden's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) also usually attends the Meetings as part of the Group management. Other members of the Group management and other executives also attend and present reports on individual issues as required.
The Board Members elected by the Annual General Meeting are all to be regarded as independent in relation to major shareholders and all, with the exception of the President, are to be regarded as independent in relation to the company and the Group management. The Board consequently complies with the requirements of the Code with regard to independent Members. The Members of the Board are presented

on pages 64­65 and on Boliden's website. The Board sets the company's financial goals and
strategy, appoints and evaluates the President and CEO, and ensures that efficient systems are put in place for following up on and monitoring operations, that the company complies with statutory and regulatory requirements, and that information is published in a correct and transparent manner. The Board adopts a Formal Work Plan every year at the Statutory Board Meeting, held after the Annual General Meeting. The Formal Work Plan regulates the work and responsibilities of the Board in greater detail, together with the special duties with which the Chairman of the Board is tasked.
The Chairman of the Board presides over the Board's work and the Board Meetings and establishes an open and constructive dialogue. The Chairman's duties also include monitoring and evaluating the expertise and work of the Board Members and the contribution they make to the Board as a whole. Another important component of the Chairman's work is monitoring the operations through an ongoing dialogue with the President. The Chairman of the Board acts as a discussion party and source of support for the President and ensures implementation of and compliance with the Board's decisions, instructions and directives. Prior to every Board Meeting, the Chairman and the President review the issues to be discussed at the meeting. The supporting documents for the Board's discussion of the issues are sent to the Members one week before each Board Meeting. The division of labour between the Board of Directors and the President is clarified in the written "Instructions to the President" adopted by the Board at the Statutory Board Meeting.

issues during the year as exploration activities, metal prices and terms, Boliden's competitive position, and acquisitions and mergers in the mining industry. The previous increase in the accident frequency has meant that efforts to improve and coordinate safety issues have been the subject of ongoing monitoring and follow up work by the Board. Efficient and appropriate environmental permit processes and reasonable operating conditions are, in light of the nature of Boliden's business, important issues for the company and its Board, and are the subject of recurring discussions. The Board has also addressed a related area, namely CSR and business ethics concerns.
The Chairman ensures that the Board and its work are evaluated annually and that the results of the evaluation are conveyed to the Nomination Committee. The evaluation is carried out by the Board itself under the guidance of the Chairman or with the help of an independent consultant. The 2016 evaluation was a self-assessment during which the Members answered a number of questions in writing on a range of different subjects and held one-on-one discussions with the Chairman of the Board, followed by a joint discussion, during which the Board discussed the conclusions drawn from the evaluation.
The overall responsibility of the Board of Directors cannot be delegated but the Board may, within itself, set up committees which prepare issues within their respective spheres. The Board has, accordingly and as in previous years, set up an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee in 2016. The Committees' members are appointed at the Board Meeting following the election held after the Annual General Meeting and their work is governed by the Committees' formal work plans and instructions.

The Board of Directors' work in 2016
The Board of Directors held 9 meetings in 2016, including the Statutory Board Meeting. A number of the Board Meetings are regularly held at the company's operating units in order to give the Members an increased insight into the operations. In 2016, the Board visited Rönnskär, Tara and Kevitsa.
The Board receives ongoing information on Boliden's commercial and financial performance and updates on Boliden's fulfilment of its sustainability goals in the form of monthly reports and at Board Meetings. Every Board Meeting consequently begins with a review of the operations and of sustainability issues.
The Board also, at the beginning of the year and in addition to these and other customary operations-related issues, sets a number of themes that it particularly wishes to address during the year in order to create an increased understanding of Boliden's opportunities and challenges from a broader perspective. The acquisition of the Kevitsa nickel and copper mine has also resulted in a considerable focus on developing an increased understanding of the nickel market and on the evaluation, financing and implementation of the acquisition. The Board has also discussed such

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee prepares a number of issues for consideration by the Board and thereby supports the Board in its endeavours to fulfil its responsibilities within the areas of auditing and internal control and with assuring the quality of Boliden's financial reporting. Boliden has an internal control function whose work involves mapping risk areas and following up on work in identified areas, amongst other things. The Committee also works with the procurement of services from the company's auditors in addition to the actual auditing services and, when so tasked by the Nomination Committee, with the procurement of auditing services. The Audit Committee meets before the publication of every financial report, and as necessary. The Audit Committee comprises Ulla Litzén (Chairwoman), Tom Erixon and Anders Ullberg. The Committee members have specialist competence, experience of and interest in financial and accounting issues ­ see Directorships and previous positions, pages 64­65. The Committee's meetings are also attended by Boliden's CFO and the Director of Internal Control. The Committee met five times in 2016. Special attention was paid in 2016 to internal controls, IT security, and accounting principles. The Audit

Committee works on the basis of a set of "Instructions for the Audit Committee" adopted every year by the Board of Directors and reports back to the Board on the results of its work.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee submits proposals for resolution by the Board regarding salary and other terms of employment for the President, and follows up on and evaluates programmes for variable remuneration for the management. The Committee also approves proposals regarding salaries and other terms of employment for the Group management, as proposed by the President. The Remuneration Committee is, furthermore, tasked with submitting proposals regarding remuneration principles for the President and Group management ­ proposals which are then submitted by the Board to the Annual General Meeting for resolution. The application of the guidelines and relevant remuneration structures and levels within the company is also followed up by the Committee and the results of this evaluation are published on the company's website. See Note 3 for an account of the remuneration paid to the Group management.
The Remuneration Committee works on the basis of a set of "Instructions for the Remuneration Committee" adopted every year by the Board of Directors and reports back to the Board on the results of its work. The Remuneration Committee comprises Anders Ullberg (Committee Chairman), and Mikael G:son Löw. The Committee has held two meetings during the year and has also had telephone contacts on a number of occasions.
The President and Group management
The President has ultimate responsibility for Boliden's strategic orientation and for ensuring the compliance with and implementation of the Board of Directors' decisions, and for ensuring that risk management, steering, systems, organisation and processes are all of a satisfactory standard. The President is supported in his work by the Group's management team which, in addition to the President, comprises the SVPs for Boliden's two Business Areas, Mines and Smelters, the CFO, and the SVP Corporate Responsibility (CR). The Group management meets regularly once
62 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

a month to follow up on operations and to discuss Group-wide issues, and to draw up proposals for strategic plans, business plans, and budgets that the President submits to the Board of Directors for their consideration. The areas addressed by the Board have largely reflected the work of the Group management during the year. The Group management also holds two meetings every year on strategy planning. The Group management, together with the management of the respective Business Areas, also meet five times a year to review Business Area-specific issues including a review of budgets and operations. For large scale projects, relevant parts of the Group management form special steering groups, together with project managers and other stakeholders, and meet regularly. The President and the central staffs hold reviews every month. The Group management also meets with the company's employee representative Board Members and their deputies ahead of every Board Meeting, at which time the Board Meeting agenda and other topical issues are discussed. The company's senior managers and specialists meet at a management conference every year for discussions intended to build consensus and achieve widespread support on important issues. See page 66 for a presentation of the Group management team.
Business management
Management by the Board goes through a chain of command from the President and the Group management to the operating units. Boliden has an organisation in which responsibilities and authority are delegated within clear frameworks. These frameworks are defined by Boliden's steering documents, budget and strategic plan. The steering documents, which are available on Boliden's internal web site and which comprise the internal framework required for effective management, include the Financial Policy, the Code of Conduct, the Anti-Corruption Policy, the Competition Law Policy, the Communications Policy, the Environmental Policy, the Health & Safety Policy, the Insider Trading Policy, and documentation on delegation and decision-making.
Sustainability governance in Boliden
Sustainability issues are an integral part of Boliden's operations and the work is conducted from the

Introduction

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

starting point of the most operationally critical issues. Sustainability issues are discussed at every management group and Board meeting, as is the case at the local management group meetings. One member of the Group management works primarily, furthermore, with CR issues. The day-to-day responsibility is decentralised to the respective units. Central sustainability, environmental, energy and HR functions follow up on the units' work and are responsible for creating a structure and orientation for the work. Networks have been established within the respective functions in order to promote knowledge exchange and development.
The sustainability issues identified by Boliden as being of the greatest significance are linked to Boliden's budget and strategy. Factors that form the basis for the prioritisation include Boliden's operations and their impact on people and the environment, the way in which work on these issues can support the operations, expectations of Boliden from internal and external stakeholders, risks and opportunities, external factors, and applicable regulations. The challenges that will be prioritised change over time and are, therefore, regularly reviewed ­ usually once every year. It is the responsibility of the various controlling parties within the Group to set local goals with regard to the overall issues. In 2013, Boliden set new goals in the sustainability sphere that will apply until 2018, inclusive ­ see pages 8-9 of the Annual Report.
Boliden's environmental work is value-based, which means that measures are approved not solely on the basis of official requirements, but on the basis of what can be done to improve the environment at the operational sites. This means that investments that yield a substantial environmental benefit for the amount invested are approved and implemented, even in the absence of external requirements or charges. Investments have, consequently, been approved with regard to, amongst other things, the separation of plastic for lead batteries at the Bergsöe lead smelter, and dioxin treatment at the Rönnskär smelter.
Viewed over a longer perspective, Boliden's longterm health and safety work has yielded good results and displayed a downwards accident trend. The trend has, however, been negative in recent years and a high priority has, therefore, been placed on measures that will, in the long-term, enable Boliden's vision of accident-free operations to be realised. These measures, which entail managerial development that aims to create wider ranging employee commitment, are now yielding results and the trend is, once again, positive at the majority of production units. The measures that were taken and which yielded results in 2016 will continue unabated with an extra focus on the units where the trend has not, as yet, been turned around. A number of investments focusing on the work environment have been approved during the year, including measures designed to increase the automation of certain jobs with a higher risk component at Kokkola and Odda. The work environment activities are, in common with the environmental work, value-based,

and investments are approved on the basis of risk analyses, rather than of mandatory laws and regulations. Boliden also imposes stringent demands on its business partners with regard to respect for, and compliance with, applicable health and safety directives and regulations. Business partners are investigated, selected, and evaluated on the basis of these issues, amongst others.
Efficient and appropriate licensing processes and reasonable operating conditions are, in the light of the nature of Boliden's operations, important issues for the company. Boliden works actively with industry organisations to monitor and promote the interests of the mining industry.
Boliden's GRI Index, and the associated information in the Annual Report and separate GRI Report have, since 2013, been subject to an external review by auditors, with the aim of, amongst other things, underlining the importance of the sustainability work to Boliden and to further reinforce the confidence of the market and other stakeholders in the work conducted by the company in this respect.
Matters of business ethics are constantly topical and an area with which the company actively works. Boliden focused specifically on competition law issues during the year and has implemented new policies in this area. Training in competition law has been provided, partly in an online format and partly in the form of targeted seminars. Boliden has also strengthened its work with sanctions compliance and implemented new tools for sanctions monitoring and evaluation of business partners. Boliden has a whistle blower function to facilitate the reporting of suspected cases of impropriety.
Auditors
The external auditor conducts independent audits of Boliden's accounts in order to ensure that they provide a correct, fair and comprehensive picture of the company's position and results. The auditor also reviews the management by the Board of Directors and the President and presents his/her observations to the Board in the absence of the management. The auditor has been in contact with the Group management in 2016 in conjunction with audits or issues arising. The auditor is a regular attendee at the Audit Committee's meetings and has met with the Board on one occasion in 2016. The auditor also reports to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The accounting firm of Deloitte AB was elected at the 2016 Annual General Meeting to serve as the company's auditors until the conclusion of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. Authorised Public Accountant, Jan Berntsson, is the auditor in charge. He is a partner in and CEO of Deloitte Sweden and his other audit engagements include Atlas Copco and Kinnevik. Remuneration to the company's auditors is payable in accordance with the approved invoices received for the period up to the end of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. See Note 4 for information on remuneration disbursed in 2016.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Internal control report by the Board of Directors
The purpose of internal control over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of the external financial reporting and to ensure that the reports are produced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, applicable legislation and statutes, and with other requirements imposed on listed companies.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that an efficient internal control system exists within the Boliden Group. The President is responsible for the existence of a process and organisation that ensure internal control and the quality of the internal and external financial reporting.
Internal control function
Boliden has an internal control function responsible for implementing processes and frameworks that secure internal control and ensure the quality of the financial reporting. The internal control function reports to the CFO and presents reports on issues relating to internal control at the Audit Committee's meetings.
Control environment
The control environment within Boliden is characterised by the fact that the Group has relatively few but large operating units that have carried out their operations for many years, using well-established processes and control activities. A structure of steering documents in the form of binding policies and guidelines for the organisation's delegated responsibilities has been established to ensure a collective attitude and methodology within the Group.
The starting point is the New Boliden Way, which includes the Code of Conduct, decision-making and authorisation instructions, and a financial manual covering financial policy, accounting and reporting instructions. Local management systems with more detailed instructions and descriptions of important processes have also been set up.

Boliden has a uniform and standardised internal control framework known as the Boliden Internal Control System (BICS).
Risk analysis
The operating units conduct ongoing risk analyses with regard to financial reporting. The risks inherent in the various accounting and reporting processes are identified, analysed and documented in BICS.
Control activities
Various types of control activities are carried out within the Group and within every different aspect of the accounting and reporting process on an ongoing basis. The control activities are carried out in order to manage known risks and to detect and rectify any errors and discrepancies in the financial reporting.
Documentation of significant control activities within the accounting and reporting process continued in BICS in 2016. For every risk identified, the controls that manage the risk are documented.
Information and communication
Information on policies, guidelines and manuals is available on Boliden's intranet. Information on updates and changes to reporting and accounting principles is issued via email and at the regular treasury and controller meetings. External communication is conducted in accordance with the Group's Communications Policy. All information must be communicated in a discerning, open and transparent manner.
Follow-ups
Work on follow-ups of, improvements to and development of systems, processes and controls within the Group is ongoing. Annual testing of documented controls within the framework of BICS has been conducted since 2009, both by internal resources and external auditors. Areas where scope for improvement is identified in conjunction with audits are documented, analysed and actioned.

New standards and interpretations that come into force in the 2017 calendar year or thereafter IFRS 9, Financial instruments: The standard comes into force for financial years beginning in 2018 or thereafter and replaces IAS 39. It is divided into three sections: classification, hedge accounting and impairment. The standard requires the classification of financial assets in accordance with three valuation categories, namely amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through the Income Statement. The classification is determined when the asset is first accounted for on the basis of the characteristics of the financial asset and the Company's business model. No major changes apply with regard to financial liabilities.
IFRS 9 also includes augmented regulations regarding disclosures in relation to risk management and the effects of hedge accounting. The standard has been complemented with regulations governing the impairment of financial assets, where the model is based on anticipated losses. An overall assessment of the effects on Boliden's accounting will be made at a later date.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The standard comes into force on 1 January 2018 and replaces existing standards and interpretations regarding revenues. The standard introduces a new revenue recognition model for contracts with customers and shall be applied to all contracts with customers with the exception of

insurance contracts, financial instruments and leasing contracts in that separate standards exist in these areas. The new standard also entails new starting points for when revenue shall be recognised and requires new evaluations by the Company management that differ from those currently applied.
The principal areas in which existing regulations differ from the new ones are: ­Control-based model for determining when revenue shall be reco-
gnised (transfer of risks and benefits is only retained to indicate that control may have been transferred). - The valuation of the revenue shall be based on what the vendor expects to receive, rather than on fair value. - New rules governing the way in which a contract's goods and services shall be distinguished in the financial reporting. - Revised criteria governing how revenue shall be recognised over time. - Expenditure for the acquisition and fulfilment of contracts. - Significantly additional disclosure requirements.
IFRS 15 is not currently expected to affect Boliden to any substantial degree with the exception of augmented disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16, Leasing: the standard comes into force on 1 January 2019 and replaces existing standards and interpretation pronouncements in leasing. The standard will entail assets and liabilities attributable to leasing agreements, with a very few exceptions, being reported in the Balance Sheet. This reporting is based on the view that the lessee is entitled to make use of an asset for a fixed period of time and, at the same time, has an obligation to pay for this right. The reporting by the lessor will, in every significant respect, remain unchanged. Boliden will be affected by the new standard such that operational leasing will, under the current standard, be reported in the Balance Sheet.
The standards and interpretations presented are those that may, in the opinion of the Group, have an effect in future. The Group intends to implement these standards when they become applicable.
Estimates and assessments In order to compile the Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS accounting principles, assessments and assumptions must be made that impact the reported asset and liability amounts and the income and expense amounts, as well as other information provided in the Financial Statements. The estimates and assessments of the Board of Directors and the Company's management are based on historical experience and forecast future trends. The actual outcome may differ from these assessments.
Valuation of inventories It is not easy, in the smelters' process inventories and stocks of finished metals, to differentiate between externally purchased material and mined concentrate from the Group's own operations. Calculating the internal profit of inventories and the reported value of process inventory consequently entails estimations of the share of the process inventory and finished metal stocks that comes from the in-house mining operations, based on the quantities of mined concentrate bought in and produced in-house.
Pension undertakings Pension provisions are dependent on the assumptions made in conjunction with the calculations of the amounts. The assumptions refer to discount interest rates, rate of salary increases, future increases in pensions, the number of remaining working years for employees, life expectancy, inflation and other factors, and are reviewed annually. The assumptions are made for every country in which Boliden has defined benefit pension plans. The most significant assumptions, in Boliden's opinion, are with regard to the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and life expectancy, and Boliden has elected to present sensitivity analyses for these factors. Boliden's assumptions and sensitivity analyses are presented in Note 23.

of accounts receivable and accounts payable is deemed to be the same as the reported value due to the short term to maturity, to the fact that provisions are made for bad debts, and to the fact that any penalty interest incurred will be debited. If changes in value cannot be determined for financial assets or liabilities reported at fair value, they are reported at the historical costs of the instruments at their time of acquisition, which corresponds to the fair value at the time of acquisition. Boliden provides information on all financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value in the Balance Sheet on the basis of a three-level fair value hierarchy. Level one comprises instruments that are listed and traded on an active market where identical instruments are traded. Level two comprises instruments that are not traded on an active market, but where observable market data is used for valuation of the instrument (either directly or indirectly). Level three comprises instruments where the valuation is, to a considerable extent, based on unobservable market data.
The assessments have been conducted on the basis of the circumstances and factors obtaining with regard to the various instruments. Metal futures are classified as level two, in that the discounted prices are based on listed daily prices from the exchanges. Currency futures and interest swaps have also been classified as level two, with reference to the fact that the valuation is based on observable market data. The fair value of liabilities to credit institutions has been classified as level two. Shares and participations that are not listed have been classified as level three. Exceptions to classification on the basis of the fair value hierarchy are made for accounts receivable, liquid assets and accounts payable where the reported value is deemed to constitute a reasonable estimation of the fair value.
Amortised cost Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method. This means that any premiums or discounts, as well as expenses or income directly attributable to them, are distributed over the duration of the contract with the aid of the estimated effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that yields the instrument's historical cost as a result in conjunction with current value calculation of future cash flows.
Valuation category Boliden divides financial instruments into the following valuation categories. See also Note 29.
Held at fair value Derivatives valued at fair value and for which changes in value are reported under net financial items. The derivatives comprise currency futures and are not included in hedge accounting.
Loans and accounts receivables This category includes financial investments, receivables not listed on an active market, and liquid assets. Liquid assets are defined as, in addition to cash and bank balances, short-term investments with a maximum term of three months at the time of acquisition and which can easily be converted to cash. Liquid assets are only exposed to an insignificant risk of fluctuations in value and are reported according to the amortised cost method. Receivables are defined as accounts receivable and interest-bearing short-term holdings of securities or other investments which are not classified as fixed assets and which are not attributable to liquid assets. Receivables are reported in the anticipated recoverable amount, i.e. after deductions for bad debts, which are assessed on an individual basis. The anticipated term of accounts receivables and other current receivables is short and the value is, therefore, reported at the nominal amount without discounting in accordance with the amortised cost method.
Financial assets available for sale Assets in this category comprises shares valued at fair value with changes in value recognised under Other comprehensive income. If it is not possible to establish the fair value of such shares, they are reported at their historical cost, taking into account accumulated write-downs.
Derivatives used in hedge accounting This category comprises derivatives valued at fair value and which form part of fair value hedging or cash flow hedging. The derivatives comprise metals futures, currency futures, and interest derivatives. See Note 27 for details of derivatives used for hedging purposes.
76 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

Other financial liabilities Financial liabilities primarily comprise liabilities to credit institutions and accounts payable. The anticipated term of accounts payables is short and the value is, consequently, reported at a nominal amount in accordance with the amortised cost method. Liabilities to credit institutions are initially valued at amounts received, less any set-up fees, and are then valued at the amortised cost method. Interest expenses are reported on a rolling basis in the Income Statement with the exception of the part included in the historical cost for tangible fixed assets. Capitalised set-up fees are reported directly against the loan liability to the extent that the loan agreement's underlying loan guarantee has been utilised, and are recognised in the Income Statement under Other financial expenses over the contractual term of the loan. If a loan agreement is terminated or otherwise ceases to obtain at a point in time prior to the end of the original contractual term, capitalised set-up fees are taken up as income. If a current agreement is renegotiated during the contractual term, any additional fees in connection with the renegotiation are allocated over the remaining contractual term of the loans.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies Receivables, liabilities and derivatives in foreign currencies are converted to Swedish kronor at the exchange rate applying on the closing day. Exchange rate differences on operating receivables and operating liabilities are included in the operating profit, while exchange rate differences on financial assets and liabilities, including any profit/loss, are reported under financial items. Exchange rate effects on financial instruments used in cash flow hedging and the hedging of net investments in overseas operations, are reported under Other comprehensive income with the exception of any exchange rate differences on currency swaps in foreign currencies reported under net financial items.
Classification and reporting of derivatives used for hedging purposes See also "Risk management" in the Directors' Report on pages 54­57.
Fair value hedging (binding undertaking) Changes in the value of financial derivatives used to hedge a binding undertaking are reported under the operating profit together with changes in the value of the asset or liability that the hedging is designed to counter. The fair value of the derivatives is reported in the Balance Sheet as other assets and liabilities. Parts of inventories constitute binding undertakings and are reported at market value as inventory value, and changes in the value of derivatives consequently effectively match the changes in value from hedged items in the Income Statement and Balance Sheet.
Cash flow hedging (forecasted cash flows) Hedge accounting is applied to financial derivatives that refer to the hedging of forecast flows, which means that the effective share of the unrealised market values is reported under Other comprehensive income up to the point in time when the hedged item, such as forecast metal sales, US dollar income, and interest expenses, is realised and thus reported in the Income Statement. Realised profits/ losses attributable to metal and currency derivatives are reported under net sales, while the profit/loss on interest derivatives is reported under net financial items. Individual interest swaps and multiple interest swaps ­ known as portfolio hedging ­ are both used to hedge future interest payments. Any ineffective part of cash flow hedging is reported under net financial items.
Hedging of net investments Hedge accounting is applied to the profit/loss on hedging in respect of net investments in overseas operations under Other comprehensive income. Any ineffective component of these hedges is reported under net financial items. Associated hedging results are, in conjunction with the sale of overseas operations, reported in the Income Statement, together with the translation effect of the net investment.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The offsetting of financial assets and liabilities is regulated by ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements, which regulate both offsetting between contracted counterparties as part of operating activities and in conjunction with circumstances

NOTES

Impairment On each reporting occasion, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication that the value of the Group's assets has depreciated or been impaired. Should this be the case, a calculation is performed of the recoverable amount of the asset in question. Goodwill is, together with any intangible assets with an indefinable useful life, subject to annual impairment tests even if there are no indications of a reduction in its value. The recoverable amount comprises whichever is the higher of the value in use of the asset in the operations and the value that would result if the asset were sold to an independent party, fair value minus selling expenses. The value in use comprises the present value of all incoming and outgoing payments attributable to the asset for the duration of its expected use in the operations, plus the present value of the net sales value at the end of the asset's useful life. If the estimated recoverable amount is lower than the book value, the latter is written down to the former.
Impairment are reported in the Income Statement. Any impairment are reversed if changes in the assumptions leading to the original impairment mean that the impairment is no longer warranted. Impairment that have been performed are not reversed in such a way that the reported value exceeds the amount that would, following deductions for depreciation according to plan, have been reported if no impairment had been performed. Reversals of impairment performed are reported in the Income Statement. Goodwill impairment are not reversed. See also the section on Valuation of fixed assets.
Leasing A financial leasing agreement is an agreement whereby the financial risks and benefits associated with a title are, in all significant respects, transferred from the lessor to the lessee. Leasing agreements that are not classified as financial leasing agreements are classified as operational leasing agreements.
Assets held in accordance with financial leasing agreements are reported initially as fixed assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the present value of the future lease payments. The Group's liability in relation to the lessor is reported in the Balance Sheet under the heading of Liabilities to credit institutions, broken down into shortand long-term components.
Lease payments are broken down into interest and amortisation of the liability. The interest is distributed over the leasing period so that an amount corresponding to the fixed interest amount payable on the liability reported in each period is charged to each reporting period. The leased asset is depreciated according to the same principles as those that apply to other assets of the same type.
The leasing charges for operational leasing agreements are booked as costs on a linear basis over the leasing period.
Inventories The Group's inventories primarily comprise mined concentrates, materials tied up in the smelters' production processes, and finished metals. Inventories are valued at whichever is the lower of the historical cost in accordance with the first-in-first-out principle and the net sale value, taking into account the risk of obsolescence. The historical cost of inventories of metals from the company's mines and semi-finished and finished products manufactured in house comprises the direct manufacturing costs plus a surcharge for indirect manufacturing costs. Supplies inventories are valued at whichever is the lower of the average historical cost and the replacement value. When mined concentrates are bought in from external sources and definitive pricing has not yet occurred, the acquisition value is estimated at the closing day price. Fair value hedging is effected in conjunction with the definitive pricing of mined concentrates. The change in the value of hedged items in the inventory value is also reported in conjunction with fair value hedging of mined concentrates and finished metals.
Taxes The tax expense (income) for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Taxes are reported in the Income Statement under Other comprehensive income or Shareholders' equity, depending on where the underlying transaction has been reported.
Current tax is the tax calculated on the taxable profit/loss for each period. The year's taxable profit/loss differs from the year's reported profit/loss before tax in that it has been adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items and temporary differences. The Group's cur-

rent tax liability is calculated in accordance with the taxation rates stipulated or announced on the closing day.
Deferred tax is reported using the Balance Sheet method, under which deferred tax liabilities are reported in the Balance Sheet for all taxable temporary differences between reported and fiscal values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax receivables are reported in the Balance Sheet in respect of loss carry-forwards and all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is likely that these amounts can be used to offset future taxable surpluses. The reported value of deferred tax receivables is checked at the end of each accounting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable surpluses will be available for its use. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the taxation rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the asset is recovered or the liability settled.
Both deferred and current tax receivables and tax liabilities are offset when they relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority.
Provisions Provisions are reported when the Group has, or may be considered to have an obligation as a result of events that have occurred and it is likely that disbursements will be required in order to fulfil this obligation. A further prerequisite is that it should be possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount to be paid.
When a significant effect arises due to the point in time at which a provision is made, the provision is valued at the present value of the amount estimated to be required to fulfil the obligation. A discount interest rate before tax that reflects current market evaluations of the time value of money and the risks associated with the provision is applied in conjunction herewith. The increase that is due to time passing is reported as an interest expense. Provisions are broken down into short-term and long-term provisions.
Boliden's provisions primarily, with the exception of pensions (see separate section), refer to reclamation costs that are expected to arise when operations are decommissioned. Provisions are also made for any purchases of emission rights and for any remuneration payable in conjunction with the termination of employment that may be payable to employees to whom a commitment of termination has been given or to employees who accept voluntary redundancy. The Group reports a provision and a cost in conjunction with termination when Boliden is obligated either to give the employee notice prior to the normal point in time for employment cessation, or to provide remuneration with a view to encouraging early retirement.
Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a potential undertaking that derives from events which have occurred and whose incidence is only confirmed by one or more uncertain future events. A contingent liability can also be an existing undertaking that has not been reported in the Balance Sheet because it is unlikely that an outflow of resources will be required or because the size of the undertaking cannot be calculated. See Note 30.
Employee benefits Pension undertakings The Group's companies have a variety of pension systems in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries in which they operate. They are generally financed through payments made to insurance companies or through the company's own provisions which are determined through periodic actuarial calculations. The Group's provisions for pension undertakings are calculated in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits.
For pension systems where the employer is committed to defined contribution systems, the undertaking in relation to the employee ceases when the agreed premiums have been paid. Premiums paid are booked as costs on an ongoing basis.
The undertaking does not cease for pension systems where a defined benefit pension has been contractually agreed, until the agreed pensions have been paid out. Boliden commissions independent actuaries to calculate pension undertakings relating to the defined benefit pension plan arrangements in each country. For information on calculation parameters, see the section entitled "Estimates and assessments - pension undertakings" and Note 23.
Revaluations of the defined benefit net pension liability, such as actuarial profits and/or losses and the difference between the return on plan assets and the discount rate, are reported under

NOTES

Profit-sharing system A profit-sharing system was introduced for all employees of the Boliden Group in 2007. A profit share is payable when the return on capital employed exceeds 8%, and the maximum profit share (SEK 30,000/full-time employee) is payable when the return on capital employed reaches 18%. The annual maximum allocation must never, however, exceed one third of the dividend paid to shareholders. The funds cannot be disbursed to employees until after 3 years. An allocation of SEK 19,770 (6,390) per full-time employee is proposed for 2016 as the return on capital employed was 14.6% (10.1). This is, however, conditional upon the dividend resolution by the Annual General Meeting. The allocation for each year is invested in liquid interest-bearing assets and shares in Boliden.
Remuneration paid to the Board Members and senior executives Principles Fees as approved by the Annual General Meeting are payable to the Chairman of the Board and to Members of the Board. The President

and Employee representatives receive no Directors' fees. Remuneration paid to the President and other senior executives comprises the basic salary, variable remuneration, other benefits and pensions. The term senior executives refers to those persons who have comprised the Group management during the year. The Group management comprised five persons, including the President, at the end of the year. All members of the Group management are employed in Sweden.
The breakdown between basic salary and variable remuneration shall be in proportion to the executive's responsibilities and authority. The variable remuneration is maximised to 60% of the basic salary for the President, while for other senior executives, it is maximised to 40­50% of the basic salary. 10 percentage points of this is conditional on the purchase of Boliden shares for the gross sum before tax.
Pension benefits and other benefits payable to the President and other senior executives are taken into account when determining fixed and variable remuneration.

The Directors' fees shown above also include remuneration for work on the Remuneration and Audit Committees.

Variable remuneration The variable remuneration paid to the President in 2016 was based on the Group's return on shareholders' equity, and a combination of the acquisition of Kevitsa and the accident trend within the Group.
For other members of the Group management, 20-93% of the variable remuneration for 2016 was based on the Group's financial goals and 7-80% on their personal spheres of responsibility and individual targets. Other benefits refer primarily to company cars.
Pensions The President has a defined contribution pension plan to which the company allocates 35% of the fixed monthly salary on a rolling basis. The President decides for himself the level of survivor annuity, indemnity for medical treatment or disability, etc. component of his insurance solution. The President's retirement age is 65.
All other members of the Group management have defined contribution pension plans to which the company allocates 30-50% of the fixed monthly salary. The retirement age is 65.

Severance pay The President and the company shall give six and twelve months' notice of the termination of the President's position, respectively. If notice is given by the company, severance pay corresponding to twelve months' salary is payable, over and above the notice period pay. Other income shall be offset against the severance pay. No severance pay is payable in the event of notice being given by the President.
Other members of the Group management have notice periods of between three and six months if they give notice themselves. If notice of termination is given by the company, the period of notice is between six and twelve months. In addition, severance pay corresponding to a maximum of twelve months' salary shall be payable. Other income shall be offset against the severance pay. No severance pay is payable in the event of notice being given by the member of the Group management.
Preparation and decision-making process See the 2016 Corporate Governance Report for information.

NOTES

Note 11 Business combinations
Acquisitions, 2016 On 1 June 2016, Boliden Mineral AB acquired all of the shares in Kevitsa Mining Oy and its subsidiary company, FinnEx Oy, from First Quantum. Kevitsa is a nickel-copper mine in Finland. The total consideration on a debt-free basis is USD 712 m together with adjustments for working capital and net debt at closing. The consideration transferred totals SEK 5,961 m after adjustments for working capital and net debt, and has been paid in cash. A final adjustment to the consideration was carried out in October 2016 and entailed a downwards adjustment of the consideration by USD 2 m (SEK 18 m).
The acquisition of Kevitsa is consistent with Boliden's growth strategy and offers the potential for expanding Boliden's operations in the form of a high quality mine that is a good fit for Boliden, both operationally and geographically. The Kevitsa acquisition will also provide good synergies with Boliden's existing mining, concentrating, smelting, and regional exploration operations.
The acquisition includes tangible fixed assets comprising existing assets in the mining operations. The acquisition analysis has been confirmed and is final.
Kevitsa's operating profit (EBIT) and (EBITDA) for the period from the acquisition date of 1 June 2016 totalled SEK 166 m and SEK 500 m, respectively. The consolidated EBIT and EBITDA would have been affected in the sums of SEK 16 m and SEK 408 m, respectively, if the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2016.
Kevitsa will, as of 2017, begin application of Boliden's calculation model for waste rock capitalisation, which will result in a larger share being booked as an investment and an improvement in EBITDA.
The Group's cost of goods sold includes acquisition costs totalling SEK 39 m.

Capitalised reclamation costs include expenses in relation to the dismantling and removal of assets and the restoration of the sites where the assets are located. Accumulated capitalised reclamation costs total SEK 1,659 m (1,065). Accumulated depreciation totals SEK ­335 m (­240). The year's capitalised reclamation costs total SEK 594 m (-80) and are primarily attributable to amended evaluations, principally in respect of environmental permits at Aitik and the application of relevant EU legislation for the Finnish mines. The change is reported in accordance with IFRIC 1, Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities. The year's rec-

lamation costs are not included in the consolidated key ratios for the year's investments, and have no liquid effect on the Group's cash flow.
Investments in tangible fixed assets include financial leasing in the sum of SEK 0 m (0), see also Note 14 Leasing charges. The same principle applies to financial leasing as to the year's capitalised reclamation costs with regard to key ratios and cash flow.
At the end of the year, there were no material, contractual undertakings to acquire tangible fixed assets to report.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses carried forward in Norway have been taken into account in full as the company is of the opinion that Boliden will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to exploit these tax losses carried forward. Unutilised tax losses carried forward for which a deferred tax assets has not been reported totalled SEK 135 m (111) in Canada on 31 December 2016, of which SEK 21 m matures in 2017, and the remaining SEK 114 m between 2027 and 2036.

ered by a defined contribution plan that covers all employees and a contractual early retirement pension (AFP) with supplementary benefits from the ages of 62 to 67.
Events during the year The current value of Boliden's pension undertaking is lower than last year's level (recalculated) and is largely due to the effect of the transition to defined contribution pension plans in Ireland, as described above. The market value of the plan assets has decreased, year on year, as a result of these changes.
The Group's reported pension liability totals SEK 925 m (1,075), which includes endowment insurance and similar undertakings totalling SEK 94 m (91) in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Sweden.

Actuarial assumptions during the year Costs, undertakings and other factors in pension plans are calculated by means of the Projected Unit Credit Method, using the assumptions shown in the table below.
The discount rate is established for every geographical market with reference to the market return on company bonds on the closing day. In Sweden, where there is no functioning market for such bonds, the market return on housing bonds has been used and a premium for a longer term added, based on the duration of the pension undertakings.
The financing cost of the net pension liability is calculated using the discount rate and is reported under Boliden's net financial items.

The sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the basis of the above mentioned actuarial changes as Boliden is of the opinion that they can have a substantial impact on the pension liability. It is also likely that changes to these assumptions will be made. The calculations have been performed by means of the analysis of each change individ-

ually and the calculations have not taken into account any interdependence between the assumptions. No sensitivity analyses have been conducted for Norway and Finland as the amounts in question are insignificant. Other countries do not have any defined benefit pension liabilities.

Reclamation costs Provisions for reclamation costs are made on the basis of an assessment of future costs based on current technology and other conditions. Provision has been made for the current value of estimated undertakings in accordance with IAS 37 and IFRIC 1. Gradual reclamation is preferable, although most of the reclamation work is carried out after a decision to decommission. In historical terms, Boliden has succeeded in extending the useful life of its mining assets compared with the original plans. Reclamation provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The previous year's addition to existing provisions is primarily attributable to a new environmental permit at Aitik and the effect of applying relevant EU legislation for the Finnish mines.

The Parent Company sureties refer to guarantees issued for subsidiary companies. SEK 10,274 m (5,810) refers to Parent Company sureties for external financial borrowing. Parent Company sureties in the above table have been booked in the utilised amounts. Guarantees in respect of unutilised credits total SEK 7,367 m (8,765).
The possibility exists, in addition to the above specifications under the heading of contingent liabilities and the items included in the financial information, that the Group may incur environmentally-related contingent liabilities or contingent liabilities attributable to legal proceedings and claims which cannot be currently calculated but which may, in future, entail costs or investments.
Legal proceedings Overview Boliden conducts extensive domestic and international operations and is occasionally involved in disputes and legal proceedings arising in the course of these operations. These disputes and legal proceedings are not expected, either individually or collectively, to have any significant negative impact on Boliden's operating profits, profitability or financial position, over and above that detailed below.
Disputes Disputes arising from the dam breach accident in Spain In April 1998, a dam breach occurred in a tailings pond at the Los Frailes mine in Spain, which was then owned by Boliden's subsidiary, Boliden Apirsa S.L. ("Apirsa"). Following the dam breach, preliminary investigations in a criminal case were initiated against Apirsa and its representatives. In December 2000, the investigations were closed. The ruling was appealed but finally ratified in November 2001. The criminal proceedings determined that the accident was caused by design and construction errors in the dam, not by Apirsa's operations at the mine. The outcome of the criminal proceedings notwithstanding, the Spanish Ministry of the Environment declared Apirsa liable to pay an amount corresponding to approximately EUR 45 m in clean-up costs, damages and fines. This resulted, in January 2005, in Apirsa initiating insolvency proceedings in order to ensure a coordinated and orderly closure of the company. The receivers in bankruptcy have, within the framework of the insolvency proceedings, requested that Apirsa's parent company, Boliden BV, together with Boliden Mineral AB and Boliden AB, be held liable for Apirsa's shortfall in an amount which, according to the receivers in bankruptcy, totals approximately EUR 141 m, including a yet untested claim of approximately EUR 89 m which the local government (Junta de Andalucía) believes it is owed, as described in greater detail below.
As a result of the dam breach, the local government sued Apirsa in its capacity as the owner and operator of the mine at the time of accident, and Boliden BV and Boliden AB in their capacity as the direct and indirect owners of Apirsa, in a civil court, demanding joint and several liability for damages to cover expenses totalling approximately EUR 89 m. The suit was dismissed on formal legal grounds and the dismissal conformed by a higher court. Since the dismissal of the suit in the civil court, the local government in Andalucía has initiated administrative proceedings in respect of the same claim. This proceeding also resulted in the local government's ruling and claim against the Boliden companies in question being deemed invalid on formal grounds. The

Supreme Administrative Court decided that, in the light of the fact that the local government's claims have hence been ruled inadmissible in both civil and administrative courts, the civil court was the correct court in which to hear the matter. The local government consequently brought suit against the above-mentioned companies in the Seville District Court in 2015. The suit is the same as that brought back in 2002 and the local government is demanding compensation for the costs that it claims to have incurred in conjunction with the clean-up after the dam breach accident. All three defendants have contested the plaintiff's suit.
The companies that were responsible for the design and construction of the dams and against which Apirsa had previously brought suit and lost have now submitted claims against Apirsa, seeking compensation for their legal costs. Final rulings on these compensation claims will be made by the respective courts of instance. It is currently not possible to assess with any reasonable degree of certainty whether the legal cost claims can be brought against any Boliden company other than Apirsa.
Based on the legal advice and opinions given by the company's Spanish legal counsel, Boliden's overall view is that the company will not suffer any substantial financial loss as a result of the legal proceedings described. The company has made no provision, pending a final ruling.
Summons arising due to exports to Chile in the 1980s In October 2013, suit was brought against Boliden claiming damages for the arsenic exposure suffered by claimants from the Chilean town of Arica to which Boliden exported metallic residues from the Rönnskär smelter between 1984 and 1985 for processing by a Chilean company, Promel. The suit was brought by a Swedish limited partnership, Arica Victims KB. The claim comprises approximately 800 people and is for a combined total of just over SEK 105 m plus interest. Boliden has contested the claim. Boliden is of the opinion, overall, that the company will not suffer any substantial financial loss as a result of the legal process described. The company has made no provision, pending a final ruling.
Note 31 Events after 31 December 2016
Boliden invests in the Tara mine Tara, which is one of the larger zinc mines in the world, accounts for half of Boliden's production of zinc concentrate. Successful exploration has resulted in the discovery of a new mineralisation, Tara Deep, and an extension of the capacity of the tailings pond, which currently limits Tara's lifespan until 2020, has been decided. The new tailings pond will have sufficient capacity for up to 2026. The investment totals EUR 33 m and is conditional upon obtaining the necessary official permits. It is based on an extension to 2023, and the new Mineral Resources will offer additional potential. The construction of an exploration drift to the new deposit at a cost of EUR 11 m has also been approved.
The new Tara Deep deposit has inferred Mineral Resources totalling 10 Mtonnes with a zinc grade of 8.5% and a lead grade of 1.8%. The mineralisation resembles Tara's main ore body, but has a more complicated structure and is at a greater depth of between 1,200 and 1,900 m. In addition to identifying the Tara Deep deposit, successful exploration in the existing mine managed to replace virtually the entire year's production in the mineral reserve.
Diesel tax at Aitik During the period from April 2009 to October 2012, dyed diesel was incorrectly used at Aitik instead of undyed diesel. The two types carry different tax classification. When the mistake was discovered in October 2012, Boliden immediately contacted both the supplier, in order to switch to undyed diesel, and the Swedish Tax Agency, in order to inform them of what had happened. The Swedish Tax Agency imposed an energy tax liability totalling SEK 212 m, plus interest, on Boliden, which ruling has been confirmed by the Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal. In January 2016, the Supreme Administrative Court refused to leave appeal. Boliden has previously paid the energy tax imposed in the net sum of SEK 156 m (after review of the company's income tax) and booked the amount as a cost in 2015. In January 2017, the Government rejected Boliden's appeal for a reduction in or remission of the tax. The decision will have no additional effect on Boliden's result or cash flow.

PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF PROFITS

Proposed allocation of profits

The Board's proposed allocation of profits for 2016 and statement in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, 18:4
Boliden has a dividend policy whereby approximately one third of the profit after tax is to be distributed. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve payment of a dividend of SEK 5.25 (3.25) per share or a total of SEK 1,436 m (889), corresponding to 33.9% of the profit after tax for 2016. The Parent Company's non-restricted shareholders' equity totals SEK 4,920 m and the Group's total shareholders' equity is SEK 29,386 m. The non-restricted shareholders' equity in the Parent Company and the Group will total SEK 3,484 m and SEK 27,950 m, respectively, after payment of the proposed dividend to the shareholders. The Board has taken the cyclic nature

of the industry and the risks associated with the operations into account in its dividend proposal.
The Annual Accounts have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden and the Consolidated Accounts have been prepared in accordance with EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS.
The Annual Accounts and the Consolidated Accounts give a true and fair view of the Parent Company's and the Group's financial position and results of operations.
The Directors' Report for the Group and the Parent Company give a true and fair overview of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, position and results and describes the material risks and uncertainties faced by the Parent Company and the companies that make up the Group.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

Auditor's Report
To the general meeting of the shareholders of Boliden AB (publ) corporate identity number 556051-4142
REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS
Opinions
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Boliden AB (publ) for the financial year 2016-01-01­2016-1231 except for the corporate governance statement on pages 58-67. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 25-47 och 54-99 in this document.
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of parent company as of 31 December 2016 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2016 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance statement on pages 58-67. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
100 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

Recognition of revenues from sales of metals at the appropriate price and in the correct period
The group's sales of metals are to a large extent priced in US dollars and sales are often made to predetermined price terms. Individual sales transactions may represent significant amounts. Contractual prices are hedged for variations in metal prices and exchange rates. Taken together, this requires good practices to ensure that revenues are recognized at agreed prices adjusted for the effects from hedging and that revenues are recognized in the correct period.
For the group's accounting principles for revenue recognition please refer to note 1, and for the group's revenues by geographical area and revenues disaggregated on metal, concentrate and other please refer to note 2.
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of the group's accounting policy for revenue
recognition for compliance with IFRS, · evaluating the group's controls for recognizing revenues at
appropriate prices and in the correct accounting period, · analysis of revenues by metal based on sales volumes, metal
prices and exchange rates, and · on a sample basis testing of sales transactions against sales
contracts, invoices and shipping documents to assess that revenues have been recognized at appropriate prices and in the correct accounting period.
Valuation of inventory
The group's inventory consists primarily of metal concentrate, materials tied up in the production process of the smelters and finished metal. The group's accounting and valuation of inventory is complex and requires judgment about stock levels, metal content, metal prices, exchange rates and internal profits.
For the group's accounting principles for valuation of inventory please refer to note 1, and please refer to 18 for a breakdown of the group's inventory.
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of the group's valuation policy for inventory and its
compliance with IFRS, · assessing the group's controls for inventory valuation, · observations of physical inventory counts, · on a sample basis testing that the inventory has been valued to
current metal prices and exchange rates, · review of the process inventory revaluation and eliminations
for intragroup profits in inventory.
Accounting and valuation of financial instruments
The group is exposed to changes in metal prices, exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce its exposure in larger investment projects and in contracted purchase and sales commitments the group uses various types of financial instruments, including derivatives. The group also manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by reducing or extending the interest duration period via interest rate swaps. The accounting for financial instruments is complex and may have significant impact on the group's earnings and financial position.

Capitalization and depreciation of deferred mining costs
In conjunction with excavation of waste rock and production of ore in open pit mines, the costs of waste rock removal which improves access to the ore body are capitalized. Deferred mining costs are depreciated per push-back and the depreciation is based on the units of production for the entire push-back. Both the initial capitalization and the depreciation rate are dependent on planned production and estimated Mineral Reserves and, as a consequence among other things, expected future metal prices. Hence, the carrying value and depreciation of deferred mining costs are dependent on a number of complex assumptions and estimates.
For the group's accounting principles related to deferred mining costs please refer to note 1 and note 13 for the group's investments and depreciation of deferred mining costs.
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of accounting policy for deferred mining costs for
compliance with IFRS, · review of model used for capitalization and depreciation
of deferred mining costs against production costs and production volumes, and · analytical review of capitalization and depreciation in relation to production costs and production volumes.
Provisions for reclamation costs
The group has commitments for reclamation of closed mines and for reclamation costs that are expected to arise for mines when the mine operations are decommissioned. The provision for these commitments is judgmental and dependent on several factors including cost estimates for different reclamation measures, life of mine, regulatory decisions, future inflation and discount rates. Any changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the group's earnings and financial position.
For the group's accounting principles for reclamation provisions please refer to note 1 and note 13 for this year's change in capitalized reclamation costs, and note 24 for the group's reclamation provisions.
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of accounting policy for reclamation provisions for
compliance with IFRS, · evaluating the group's controls to account for reclamation
provisions,

· review of external and internal opinions on expected reclamation measures and the costs for these, and
· review of assumptions used to estimate the reclamation provisions for consistency with approved production plans, life of mines expectancies, and current financial conditions (inflation and interest rates).
Valuation of intangible and tangible fixed assets
The group's intangible and tangible assets represent significant amounts. Impairment testing of these assets is based on production plans, which in turn are based on assumptions about future metal prices, treatment and refining charges, and exchange rates. Changes in market prices for metals, treatment and refining charges, and exchange rates have a significant impact on the group's future cash flows and thus the estimated recoverable value of intangible and tangible assets and any impairment needs.
For the group's principles to prepare impairment tests for intangible and tangible assets please refer to note 1 and for significant assumptions applied in the impairment tests, please refer to note 13.
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of the group's process and principles for preparing
impairment tests for compliance with IFRS, · evaluation of key assumptions such as estimated life of mines,
production plans, metal prices, treatment and refining charges, and exchange rates and the sensitivity in these assumptions to any changes, and · review of the model used to discount future cash flows for arithmetical correctness.
Accounting for acquisition of Kevitsa
During the year the group acquired the Kevitsa mine for a purchase price of SEK 5 961 million. Accounting for business combinations requires significant judgments and estimates by management to determine the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The purchase price for Kevitsa was also hedged with forward contracts which needs to be considered when determining the final purchase price.
For the Group's purchase price allocation for the Kevitsa acquisition, please refer to note 11.

Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: · review of fair values assigned to acquired assets and assumed
liabilities, and · review of forward contracts for appropriate allocation to the
purchase price.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors
and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's responsibility
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may in-
102 | Boliden Annual Report 2016

volve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of the company's internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. · Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. · Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified.
We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in the auditor's report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Boliden AB (publ) for the financial year 2016-01-01 - 2016-12-31 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.
We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal on page 99 and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.
Auditor's responsibility
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: · has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which
can give rise to liability to the company, or · in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies
Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.

Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.
As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company's situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors' reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
The auditor's examination of the corporate governance statement
The Board of Directors is responsible for that the corporate governance statement on pages 58-67 has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.
Our examination of the corporate governance statement is conducted in accordance with FAR´s auditing standard RevU 16 The auditor´s examination of the corporate governance statement. This means that our examination of the corporate governance statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinions.
A corporate governance statement has been prepared. Disclosures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 of the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph the same law are consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.

AUDITOR'S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT ON BOLIDEN AB'S SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Auditor's Limited Assurance Report on Boliden AB's Sustainability Report

To Boliden AB
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Board of Directors of Boliden AB to undertake a limited assurance engagement of Boliden ABs Sustainability Report for the year 2016. The Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability Report in the GRI index on pages 4-7 in Boliden's GRI Report.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management for the Sustainability Report
The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria, as explained on page 8 in Boliden's GRI Report, and are the parts of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (published by The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)) which are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This responsibility also includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with RevR 6 Assurance of Sustainability Reports issued by FAR. A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement conducted in accordance with IAASB's Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.

The firm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard on Quality Control) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The procedures performed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion.
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.
Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES

Mineral Reserves and Resources

Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources are the basis for the future viability of a mining company's operations. The reserves are reduced each year through mining activities, and it is, therefore, vital that Mineral Reserves and Resources are increased by means of successful exploration or acquisitions. In 2016, Boliden made one acquisition ­ Kevitsa in Finland ­ and was also able to announce a new, inferred Mineral Resource at Tara in Ireland. Large parts of Garpenberg's Mineral Resources were, furthermore, upgraded to Mineral Reserves.

Boliden shall work to ensure optimal resource and materials handling at every stage of the value chain and the responsible conversion of assets in the form of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves is an important component of this work. We consequently follow up on our Mineral Resources and Reserves carefully and produce an annual summary. The estimations of Mineral Resources and Reserves are always associated with a degree of uncertainty as to the geological basis and due to sensitivity to the pricing and cost conditions used.
Mineral Resources and Reserves 2016
Boliden's estimations and compilations are carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish industry organisation for mining and metal companies, Swedish Association of Mines, Minerals and Metal Producers, (SveMin).

the nearby Nautanen deposit with the aim of submitting an application for a mining concession in 2017.
The Boliden Area
In Kristineberg, Boliden has continued its exploration in the direction of Rävliden, approximately 2.5 km to the west of the Kristineberg ore deposit. The Mineral Resource has been increased and some parts upgraded to Indicated Resource. Rävliden is reported under Kristineberg. The Maurliden Östra mine has been mined out and a final report submitted to the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden. There are, however, still some Mineral Resources which may, in future, be profitable to mine. Exploration in Renström and Kankberg has added new quantities to the reserves, but they fell short of the quantities extracted during the year, and the Boliden Area's total reserves fell in 2016.

All values are shown in ktonnes.

Aitik
No extensive exploration work was carried out at the Aitik mine during the year and the changes in the Mineral Reserve effectively correspond to the year's mining. The extraction of molybdenum has been evaluated, leading to the conclusion that in the light of the anticipated price trend, investing in the extraction of molybdenum at Aitik is not profitable. Molybdenum consequently no longer forms part of Aitik's Mineral Reserve, but as conditions may change, it is still included in the mine's Mineral Resource. Work continues on

Garpenberg
New Mineral Resources have been added and a significant element of the Mineral Resources have been upgraded to Mineral Reserves. The addition to the reserve has been proven by means of technical studies. All of the new sections are showing good profitability, although they have meant a fall in Garpenberg's average grade. A total of over 36 Mtonnes has been added to the Mineral Reserve, but the substantial upgrade from Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve has resulted in a net reduction in Mineral Resources.

Boliden Annual Report 2016 | 105

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES

Kevitsa
Boliden acquired Kevitsa in 2016, and production in the mine has proceeded according to plan. The Mineral Reserve figures for this year are based on Boliden's more conservative estimation, resulting in a slight fall in the reserve's grades.
Kylylahti
Boliden acquired Kylylahti 2014, and production at the mine is going well. Exploration has not yielded any major additions: indeed, infill drilling has actually resulted in some losses. There was a 1 Mtonne reduction in the Mineral Reserve.
Tara
The Tara Deep deposit at Tara has added 10 Mtonnes in the form of a new, inferred Mineral Resource (8.5% Zn and 1.8% Pb). The mineralisation is similar to Tara's other ores, but is at a greater depth of 1.2 ­ 1.9 km below the surface. Much of what was mined was replaced with new reserves. Mineral Resources, excluding Tara Deep, decreased.
About the classification
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are estimated separately and broken down into different categories. Boliden's Mineral Reserves are not subsidiary amounts of the Mineral Resources, and when a Mineral Resource is upgraded to a Mineral Reserve, the quantity is eliminated from the Mineral Resource.
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such a form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Location, quantity, grade, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence, sampling and knowledge. A Mineral Reserve is proved to be economically viable. It includes diluting materials and allowances for ore losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of, and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing,

legal, environmental, social and political factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
Inferred Mineral Resource
An inferred Mineral Resource is a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, shape, grades and mineral content can be estimated with only a low degree of certainty. It is indicated by geology, sampling and anticipated but unverified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information obtained through exploration, sampling and testing carried out in accordance with appropriate techniques. The information is limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
Indicated Mineral Resource
An indicated Mineral Resource is a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, shape, grades and mineral content can be estimated with reasonable certainty. It is indicated by geology, sampling and anticipated but unverified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information obtained through exploration, sampling and testing carried out in accordance with appropriate techniques. The information points are, however, too sparse or inappropriately distributed to ensure the deposit's geological and/or grade continuity.
Measured Mineral Resource
A measured Mineral Resource is a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, shape, grades and mineral content can be estimated with a high degree of certainty. It is based on information gained through detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing carried out in accordance with appropriate techniques. The information points are sufficiently dense to demonstrate the deposit's geological and/or grade continuity.
Probable Mineral Reserve
A probable Mineral Reserve meets the requirements for an indicated or, under certain circumstances, measured Mineral Resource where mining-engineering and profitability studies show that it is technically and economically feasible to mine and process the deposit in line with the company's profitability requirements.

MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES

Density
Formulas based on head grades are utilised for massive sulphide ores, which make up the majority of Boliden's Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The formulas have been verified using density measurements. In other cases, measurements are carried out for the different ores or rock types that affect the density.

Waste rock dilution
Mining usually incurs some waste rock dilution that varies, depending on the mining method used, the ore's geometry, and other geological factors. Boliden systematically monitors the waste rock dilution of the ore extracted and the experience gained thereby enables waste rock dilution to be included in all Mineral Reserve estimations.

380
Boliden's exploration costs in 2016 totalled SEK 380 m (370).

Proven Mineral Reserve
A proven Mineral Reserve meets the requirements for a measured Mineral Resource where mining-engineering and profitability studies show that it is technically and economically feasible to mine and process the deposit in line with the company's profitability requirements.

Basis for the estimations
Boliden is 100% owner of all properties and holds the required exploitation concessions and environmental permits for all of the mines currently in operation. The environmental permits have limited durations and are, therefore, subject to an ongoing process of renewal. The Mineral Resources are protected by exploitation concessions or exploration permits. The estimations are based on the following underlying factors:

Metal prices
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are the basis for the company's long-term planning and will be mined for many years to come. Planning prices, which are an expression of the anticipated average prices for metals and currencies over the forthcoming business cycle are, therefore, primarily utilised in the estimations. Boliden's current planning prices are shown in the following table:

Ore losses
Some ore may have to be left unextracted (e.g. in the form of pillar offset), depending on the mining method used, the ore's geometry and other technical factors. The Mineral Reserve estimations take these factors into account, based on assumptions regarding mining method and the information available when the estimations were made.
Minimum ore width
The minimum horizontal ore width is based on assumptions regarding mining method and equipment. Ore zones that are narrower than the minimum ore width are reestimated using the average for the full width.
Regulations, codes and recommendations
Boliden's Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources have been estimated and compiled in accordance with recommendations for application in their respective countries by the Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian industry organisations for mining and metal companies ­ SveMin, FinnMin and Norsk Bergindustri, respectively ­ known as the FRB standard. This is an independent set of regulations but based on "The International Template for the public reporting of exploration results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves", produced by the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) in a bid to achieve a harmonised international practice. Reporting at Tara complies with the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy's JORC code.
The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves that have been compiled and presented in this report have been reviewed and approved by Gunnar Agmalm, Boliden's Mineral Reserves and Project Evaluation Manager, who is registered as a "Qualified Person" by SveMin and as a "Competent Person" in accordance with JORC.

Capital employed The Balance Sheet total less interest-bearing investments, tax receivables and non-interest-bearing provisions and liabilities.
Cash flow from operating activities Cash flow generated via the operating profit, adjusted for items not affecting cash flow, tax paid and change in working capital.
Cash flow per share The cash flow for the period divided by the average number of outstanding shares.
Dividend yield Dividend per share as a percentage of the share price.
Earnings per share Net result for the period divided by the average number of outstanding shares.

Equity/assets ratio Shareholders' equity as a percentage of the Balance Sheet total.

Total return The sum of the share's performance during the year plus dividend paid divided by the share price at the beginning of the year.

Definition of Cash cost

Definition of Cash margin

Boliden uses the Wood Mackenzie's cash cost metrics, C1 Normal costing and C1 Pro rata costing, to measure the mines' cost position in relation to other mines worldwide. The lower a mine's cash cost, the better its cost position. Cash cost is expressed in USc/lb. of metal and can be multiplied by 22.0462 (rounded off) to obtain the price in USD per tonne of metal.
Normal costing In normal costing calculations, the costs are allocated in their entirety to one main metal and then reduced by the net revenue1) of other metals, known as by-metals.
+ Mining operations, concentration and administration costs2)
+ Costs of freighting concentrate to smelters
+ Treatment and refining charges (TC/RC)
­ Deductions for net revenue of by-metals
= Cash cost C1 Normal costing

Pro rata costing In pro rata cash costing, the costs are divided up between the various metals on the basis of the individual metal's share of the total net revenue.
Composite costing In composite costing, mines are included using either normal costing or pro rata costing on the basis of criteria based on the metals' net revenue. If a metal accounts for 65 per cent or more of the total net revenue, the cash cost is calculated using normal costing, while if a metal accounts for less than 65 per cent of the total net revenue, the cash cost is calculated using pro rata costing.
+ Income from payable metal ­ The metal's freight cost ­ The metal's treatment and refining charges = The net revenue of the metal

Boliden uses Wood Mackenzie's cash margin compilations to measure the smelter's cost position in relation to other smelters. The cash margin is the difference between income and cash cost, expressed in USc/lb. of metal and can be multiplied by 22.0462 (rounded off) to obtain the price in USD per tonne of metal. The income comprises treatment and refining charges, free metals and income from by-products.
The income for zinc smelters includes income generated by sales of surplus energy, while for copper smelters, the income generated by the sales of sulphuric acid and surplus energy is added as a credit when calculating the cash cost.
The calculations for copper smelters are expressed as unit of metal produced from concentrate, while for zinc smelters, it is expressed as unit of finished metal produced. Income is normally included if it is regarded as having been derived from the main process during the production of metal and the product is saleable.

1) Calculating the net revenue of mines' metals The net revenue is the payable income from the metal, less freight costs and treatment and refining charges.
2) Administrative costs attributable to the mine.

GLOSSARY
Industry-specific concepts and definitions

Alloy Substance with metallic properties which is composed of two or more chemical elements, at least one of which is a metal.
Base metals The most common metals, e.g. zinc, copper, lead, nickel and aluminium.
Cash cost Common measurement used to show the costs affecting a mine's cash flow, converted into US dollars (average rate for the measurement period). Usually shown in cents per ounce. To show the cash cost in USD/tonne, multiply by 22. Used to compare the mine's cost position in relation to other mines. See Definitions.
Complex ore Ore that contains several metals, e.g. zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver.
Concentrator A plant in which ore is processed mechanically and/or chemically to extract and produce a concentrate of the valuable minerals.
Copper cathode An end product from copper smelters in the form of 99.99 per cent pure copper plates.
Free metals The percentage of metal concentrates bought in that an individual smelter can process over and above the payable metal content. This percentage generates income without incurring a raw material cost.
Galvanising An electrochemical process whereby a metal is coated with a thin layer of another metal, such as zinc. Galvanising is commonly used to protect against corrosion (rust).
Gold doré A gold/silver alloy cast as a bullion in the refinery. Further processed to pure gold and silver at a smelter.
Jarosite A mineral primarily comprising iron sulphate that is a common waste product of zinc production.
Kaldo furnace Rotating and tippable furnace for the smelting and process treatment of copper, lead and precious metals, etc., including the recycling of metals from electronic scrap. The plastic present in the scrap is used to smelt the metals, thereby reducing the process' energy requirement.
LBMA London Bullion Market Association. International market responsible for the daily pricing of precious metals.
LME London Metal Exchange. International market where non-ferrous metals are bought and sold. Trading on the LME is used as the basis for the daily pricing of metals worldwide. The LME also maintains warehouse stocks of the metals traded.
Metal concentrate Also known as dressed ore or mined concentrate. Metal concentrate is the result of the concentration processes that separate out the financially valuable minerals present in ore from those with no financial value.
Metal content The quantities of, for example, zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver contained in concentrates. Zinc concentrates generally con-

tain approximately 50 per cent zinc metal, while copper concentrates generally contain approximately 25 per cent copper. The lead content of mined concentrate is usually around 65 per cent.
Metal equivalents Used to describe the environmental impact of emissions and discharges to air and water. The metal equivalent (Me-eq) takes into account the toxicity of each metal (relative to Cu) and provides a better metric of the environmental impact than the combined weight of the metals.
Metal premium The price agreed in advance, over and above the LME price, and paid by customers for specifically adapted metal that is free delivered.
Mineralisation A concentration of minerals in the bedrock.
Mineral Reserves Those parts of a mineral resource that can be mined and processed in accordance with the company's profitability requirements and taking into account factors such as waste rock dilution and the percentage of metal in an ore that can be extracted in the concentration process are transferred to Mineral Reserves and hence eliminated from the Mineral Resources. Mineral Reserves are divided into two categories: probable Mineral Reserves and proven Mineral Reserves.
Mineral Resource A concentration of minerals in the bedrock that may become commercially extractable. Mineral Resources are divided into three categories: inferred Mineral Resources, indicated Mineral Resources, and measured Mineral Resources.
Open pit A method of mining mineral deposits located near the surface. The waste rock is stripped and the ore mined directly at the surface.
Ore Economic term for minerals, rock types or other bedrock components that can be profitably mined to extract metals or other valuable substances.
Ore grade The average quantity of valuable metals in a tonne of ore, expressed as grams per tonne for precious metals and as a percentage for other metals.
Payable metal content The percentage of the metal content of the concentrate for which the smelters pay when purchasing concentrate.
Precious metals Metals that are less commonly present in the earth's crust than base metals and which are regarded, to a greater extent, as a type of investment asset by financial sector players. The most common precious metals are gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
Price escalators (PP) Also known as price-sharing clauses. The clauses in the agreements for zinc smelting charges that distribute changes in metal prices between mines and

smelters. There have been no price escalator clauses in copper treatment and refining charges for many years now.
Raw materials feed A smelter's raw material input, i.e. the amount of metal concentrate or secondary materials processed and refined.
Recovery The percentage portion of the quantity of a given metal in an ore extracted during the concentration process.
Secondary material Various types of recycling materials from which metals can be recovered, e.g. electronic and metal scrap, metal ashes, slag, dust and scrap lead batteries.
Smelter A plant in which metal raw materials, metal concentrates or secondary materials are processed to separate metals from impurities.
Treatment and refining charges (TC/RC)The price of concentrate is defined as the LME price less treatment and refining charges, which comprise the remuneration received by the smelter for refining the smelting material (concentrate and secondary materials) and extracting metals. Copper smelters' processes can be broken down into a treatment phase and a refining phase, while zinc smelters' processes only involve a treatment phase, and hence zinc smelters' remuneration only comprises a treatment charge (TC).
Underground mine Mine where the ore is mined using underground tunnels. The mining methods used in Boliden's underground mines include the cut-and-fill method and sub-level stoping.
Waste rock Economic term for rock which, unlike ore, contains no valuable material.
Zinc ingot An end product from zinc smelters with detailed specifications with regard to degree of purity, weight and size.
