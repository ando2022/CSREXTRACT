Cover image: House dust mite (HDM) allergy, the most common in the world, can trigger allergic asthma in children and adults. In 2015, ACARIZAX®, ALK's new HDM SLIT-tablet, was approved in Europe for adult use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma which is not well controlled by conventional symptom-relieving medication, and a paediatric development programme is currently underway. More over, the product was approved in Japan in late 2015.

2015 results**
Results in 2015 exceeded expectations following strong revenue growth of 9% in Q4. Full-year revenue increased to DKK 2.57 billion (2.43). Base business revenue grew by 5% on a like-for-like basis to DKK 2.38 billion (2.22), while partner income fell, as expected, to DKK 185 million (214) due to lower milestone payments. EBITDA before special items was DKK 452 million (453) as higher sales coupled with operational efficiencies and cost savings largely offset extra costs in support of the long-term growth strategy.
*Revenue from ALK's base business is defined as total revenue excluding revenues from the SLIT-tablet partnerships in North America and International markets
** Comparative figures for 2014 are shown in brackets

Growth drivers
With revenue growth of 21% in local currencies, adrenaline auto-injectors, diagnostics and other products grew the fastest. Diagnostics and other products recorded near double-digit growth, while sales of the adrenaline auto-injector Jext® saw high double-digit growth following the restoration of full market coverage in 2014. In local currencies, sales of SLIT-tablets in Europe (GRAZAX®) grew by 16% in 2015, while SCIT and SLIT-drops sales remained unchanged. SCIT sales increased slightly, whereas SLIT-drops sales continued to decline in most markets except France, which saw growth, particularly towards the end of the year.

ACARIZAX® launch in Europe
ACARIZAX®, the first and only SLIT-tablet for the treatment of both house dust mite (HDM) allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma, was approved by 11 European countries in 2015 and, as of February 2016, has been launched in Germany and Denmark with further launches planned during 2016. ACARIZAX® is a new treatment option for patients diagnosed with moderate to severe HDM allergy, whose disease is not well controlled despite the use of symptom-relieving medication.

ACARIZAX® international roll-out
Japan, where the HDM SLIT-tablet will be known as MITICURETM, became the product's first launch market in December 2015. Meanwhile, progress towards registration and launch continued in other markets ­ preparations for filings are advancing in North America and Russia, regulatory reviews are ongoing in Australia, Switzerland and Turkey, and registration work is about to commence in South-East Asia.

Towards a global ALK
As part of its efforts to globalise access to evidence-based allergy immunotherapy, ALK entered into a new partnership agreement in 2015 with Seqirus (formerly bioCSL) covering ACARIZAX® and GRAZAX® in Australia and New Zealand. At the beginning of 2016, the partnership with Abbott was expanded to cover ACARIZAX® in seven new growth markets in South-East Asia.

2016 outlook
· Base business revenue is expected to grow organically by approximately 10% to DKK 2.6 billion
· EBITDA before special items, excluding revenues from sales royalties and milestone payments, is expected at approximately DKK 450 million (331)
· ALK's partnerships are expected to further contribute to ALK's revenue and earnings. Potential milestone payments in 2016-17 total DKK 75 million
· Free cash flow is expected to be largely level with 2015

Profile and priorities

ALK's strategic intent
Building on a vision of being both the commercial leader and the foremost innovator within allergy immunotherapy (AIT), ALK's strategy aims to transform the company from a largely European company focused on allergic rhinitis into a truly global company with a portfolio of standardised and evidence-based products which, in addition to allergic rhinitis, also treat allergic asthma and potentially prevent the onset of asthma.
ALK's people
ALK employs around 1,900 people in 19 countries: Austria, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK and the USA. The company also has distributors in a large number of other markets.

Focus on respiratory diseases
ALK is a global pharmaceutical company with a mission to improve quality of life for allergy patients.

With a near-century long heritage of pioneer research and product innovation in the treatment of allergic disease, today ALK is focused on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the respiratory diseases allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Moreover, ALK has specialised in venom immunotherapy, a life-saving cure for patients suffering from bee and wasp allergies.

patients' risk of developing other allergies as well as asthma. Clinical benefits have been shown to continue far beyond completion of the threeyear course of treatment.

ALK is a world leader in allergy immunotherapy (AIT), a unique diseasemodifying treatment that addresses the underlying cause of allergy. The treatment induces a protective immune response that provides sustained symptom relief and potentially reduces

ALK's primary focus is on allergy patients whose disease is not well controlled despite the use of symptomrelieving medication and, today, an estimated 1.5 million people use ALK's products or treatments based on its products.

ALK's partners
ALK partners with leading global healthcare companies and regional specialty pharma companies to globalise its product portfolio: Abbott for Russia and South-East Asia; MSD (known as Merck & Co., Inc in the USA and Canada) for the USA, Canada and Mexico; Seqirus Ltd for Australia and New Zealand; Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for Japan, and Eddingpharm Ltd in China.
A long and proud heritage
ALK's history dates back to 1923 when the first allergen extracts were produced at the pharmacy of the Copenhagen University Hospital. Since the mid-1980s, international expansion, mergers and acquisitions have helped shape today's ALK. The company was listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen (OMX: ALK B) in 2005.

Broad range of products

The company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of products for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases: · SCIT (subcutaneous allergy im-
munotherapy injections) is given by specialists as regular injections under the skin. ALK brand names include: Alutard SQ® and AVANZ® · SLIT-drops (sublingual allergy immunotherapy drops) are droplets administered under the tongue by patients at home. ALK brand names include: SLIToneULTRA® and Osiris®

· SLIT-tablets (sublingual allergy immunotherapy tablets) are fastdissolving tablets which dissolve under the tongue and can be administered by patients at home. ALK and its partners' brand names include: GRAZAX®/GRASTEK®, RAGWITEK® and ACARIZAX®/MITICURETM
As experts in the field of allergy, ALK also manufactures related products ranging from diagnostic tests that can help identify specific allergies, to an adrenaline auto-injector pen, Jext®, for emergency interventions in potentially life-threatening cases of anaphylaxis.

Research-driven company

Since its foundation in 1923, ALK has consistently devised and developed major advances in allergy treatment.
Over recent years, ALK and its partners have invested substantially in the research and development of new, evidence-b ased SLIT-tablets covering all the major respiratory allergies ­ house dust mite, grass pollen, tree pollen, ragweed pollen and Japanese cedar pollen.
In parallel, ALK has funded clinical research that has confirmed the long-held

belief that AIT has a role to play in treating allergic asthma and potentially preventing the onset of asthma. ACARIZAX®, which is currently being launched in Europe, became the first tablet-based product in the world with a market authorisation indicated for addressing the underlying cause of allergic asthma. Recently, ALK also disclosed data from a long-term clinical trial into asthma prevention showing that GRAZAX® significantly reduced the proportion of children experiencing asthma symptoms and using asthma medication.

European launch countries, promoting awareness and adoption among doctors and patients, and continuing work on a
paediatric version of the product.

2
Expansion
Work towards registrations of ACARIZAX® in additional countries, both alone and in partnership with
others. Priority markets include: Australia, Canada, Russia, Spain,
Turkey, the USA and markets in South-East Asia.

3
Continued growth
Continue to grow ALK's base business and increase efficiency by simplifying the business structure wherever
possible.

Operational review

The majority of current revenue ­ 75% in 2015 ­ comes from Europe where ALK subsidiaries and sales offices serve 18 markets. Further markets are handled by distributors. Outside Europe, ALK has subsidiaries and sales offices in selected countries and distributors in others. In addition, the company has a network of strategic partnerships covering key international markets.
2015 saw important progress for ALK's efforts to globalise the reach of its evidencebased products. A new partnership with Seqirus was established for Australia and New Zealand, Torii launched ACARIZAX® in Japan under the MITICURETM brand and filed for approval of the Japanese cedar SLIT-tablet. Clinical progress was also seen in other markets, including North America and Russia under the partnerships with MSD and Abbott, respectively. In the beginning of 2016, the partnership with Abbott was extended to include seven new markets in South-East Asia.
House dust mite (HDM) allergy is the world's most common allergy and ACARIZAX®, with its potential as a new treatment option in asthma, is seen as an engine for global reach and growth. Accordingly, the 2015 approval of ACARIZAX® in 11 European coun-

tries followed by launches in Germany and Denmark, represent early landmark events in delivering ALK's long-term strategy, with ACARIZAX® becoming the first and only SLITtablet approved for the treatment of both HDM allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma.
In 2015, ALK continued to expand the reach of its base business with the acquisition of its Turkish distributor, which will become a hub for further expansion in the Middle East region. Similarly, expansion into Eastern Europecontinued from the Slovakian subsidiary, established in late-2014.
Base business value creation
A key principle of the strategy is the continuing drive for value creation in the base business, irrespective of partner income. The push for geographical expansion, alongside the Simplify programme to streamline the supply chain and rationalise the product portfolio, illustrate this continuing commitment.
In future, ALK will increasingly focus on highvolume, evidence-based products such as

the SLIT-tablets. In line with this strategy, ALK entered into an agreement to divest the European veterinary business in December.
2015 financial results
Financial results exceeded the initial outlook from February 2015 as well as the latest outlook from November as sales benefited from a strong Q4 with quarterly revenue growth of 9%. Q4 progress was driven by increased demand in parts of Europe, particularly France, where authorities ordered ALK's main competitor to temporarily suspend production and to recall certain products.
Full-year base business revenue grew by 4% in local currencies. Growth was 5% on a like-for-like basis disregarding a 2014 milestone payment from ALK's partner for China. Partner income was lower than in 2014 due to lower milestone payments.
Operating profit (EBITDA before special items) was DKK 452 million (453). ALK allocated significant resources to initiatives in support of the long-term growth strategy, including market-building activities ahead of the ACARIZAX® launch, as well as the

Facts and glossary
Immunotherapy treats the cause of allergy

Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment which both reduces allergic symptoms and treats the underlying cause of a specific allergy. AIT also has the potential to prevent the progression of an allergic disease into allergic asthma or other allergies. AIT increases the body's immunological tolerance to specific allergens following repeated doses of the relevant allergen. As a result, the immune system is `re-educated' so that the

basic immunological response to the allergen is altered.
AIT is administered in three different ways: SCIT (subcutaneous injections), SLIT-drops (sublingual drops) or SLIT-tablets (sublingual tablets). ALK's product portfolio comprises all three and covers the most common allergies, including grass, ragweed, house dust mite, tree (birch), Japanese cedar, cat, as well as bee and wasp venom.

SCIT and SLIT-drops are commonly administered on a named-patient basis by specialists, whereby treatments are produced specifically for an individual patient and are used under the authority of the prescribing doctor. SLIT-tablets are standardised and approved for use under prescription and are supported by evidence from clinical trials where their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.

start of the treatment phase. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of GRAZAX® compared with placebo on the risk of developing asthma.

Key events after the end of the financial year
In January, ALK saw further progress in its strategic efforts:
Guidance upgrade ALK revised its 2015 financial guidance upwards following a strong increase in sales in Europe during Q4 reflecting the market developments in France. ALK also initiated a rapid increase in the production of SLITdrops at its facility in France to help meet the increased demand for its products.
Top-line results from landmark GAP trial The multi-year GRAZAX® Asthma Prevention (GAP) trial reported results that documented a disease-modifying effect, providing

The GAP trial demonstrated that GRAZAX® treatment significantly reduced the proportion of children that experienced asthma symptoms or used asthma medication. This effect was sustained for two years after end of treatment.
The trial also confirmed that GRAZAX® treatment significantly reduced allergic rhino conjunctivitis (eye and nose) symptoms. This effect was also sustained two years after end of treatment and the results were in line with previous trial results.
The trial did not show an effect in terms of time to first diagnosis of reversible impairment of lung function.
The GAP trial was initiated in 2009 and consisted of a three-year treatment phase and a two-year follow-up phase. The trial included 812 children aged 5-12 years at the

Expanded partnership with Abbott In the beginning of 2016, ALK also announced an expansion of the partnership with Abbott to cover ACARIZAX® in seven new growth markets in South-East Asia.
Under the terms of the expanded partnership, Abbott gains exclusive rights to register, promote and distribute the product in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. ALK and Abbott will share the revenue generated in these territories while ALK will be responsible for product supply to Abbott.
Regulatory submissions in the new markets are expected to be based upon ALK's regulatory filing which was approved by European authorities in August 2015. As a result, the first launches in South-East Asia are expected to take place from 2017 onwards.

Revenue by geography and product line

Europe
Revenue in Europe grew by 4% in local currencies to DKK 1,937 million (1,858). Europe thus accounted for 75% of ALK's total revenue (76).

Total revenue by geography

Europe  North America

8% 17%

International markets

75%

Revenue growth was 7% (local currencies) disregarding the phase-out of the local, unregistered SLIT-drops portfolio in the Netherlands. The phase-out was effectively completed in 2015 but affected comparative figures.
Growth across Europe was attributable to SCIT products, GRAZAX®, Jext® adrenaline auto-injector, and diagnostics, while sales of SLIT-drops, as expected, continued to decline in all markets but France.

ALK increased sales of its allergen extracts, diagnostics and other products to North American specialists and clinics by 12% (local currencies) to DKK 398 million (301). Growth was particularly strong from allergen extracts.

Progress was notable in the Nordic region, the UK, Switzerland, France and in Eastern Europe. Growth was also recorded in Spain and Italy, suggesting that these markets are rebounding after the financial crisis. In Germany, overall revenue increased modestly as GRAZAX® sales benefited from new treatment guidelines favouring evidence-based products. Conversely, this led to weaker sales of non-registered, named-patient products. Towards the end of the year, ALK saw a strong increase in sales in Europe, reflecting the market development in France.

International markets
Revenue in International markets grew by 127% (local currencies) to DKK 190 million (76), with International markets accounting for 8% (3) of ALK's total revenue.
This significant growth was primarily due to a milestone payment received from Torii upon approval of ACARIZAX® in Japan, where it is branded MITICURETM. The partnership also included payments for product supply and R&D support.

Sales in the Benelux countries declined by double digits as a result of the above- mentioned phase-out.
North America
Revenue in North America declined 26% (local currencies) to DKK 442 million (499). North America accounted for 17% of ALK's total revenue (21).
No milestone payments from MSD were recognised in 2015 versus the DKK 162 million acknowledged in 2014. Other income from the MSD partnership increased to DKK 44 million (36) and included sales royalties on GRASTEK® and RAGWITEK®, as well as product supply and R&D support payments.

Sales of ALK's own products in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, South America and other markets were down, predominantly due to a slowdown of growth in the largest market, China, which affected many pharmaceutical companies in 2015. ALK sales in Turkey, however, increased following the 2015 acquisition of the company's distributor, whose activities were integrated into ALK's Turkish subsidiary.
SCIT and SLIT-drops
Across all markets, revenue from SCIT and SLIT-drops was largely unchanged in local currencies and amounted to DKK 1,845 million (1,786). Disregarding the Dutch phaseout and a one-off payment from ALK's

SLIT-tablets
Revenue from SLIT-tablets was down 4% (local currencies) to DKK 439 million (432). This fall was solely due to lower milestone payments. Sales of SLIT-tablets in Europe (GRAZAX®) amounted to DKK 253 million (218) following 16% sales growth (local currencies). Revenue from SLIT-tablets outside Europe was DKK 186 million (214) and included income from the partnerships in North America, Japan and Australia.
Other products and services
Revenue from other products and services (adrenaline auto-injectors, diagnostics, etc.) grew by 21% (local currencies) to DKK 285 million (215). Jext® yielded strong double-digit growth versus 2014 when it was being reintroduced to the markets. Sales of diagnostics and other products developed positively throughout the year, both in North America and Europe.

The world market for allergy immunotherapy

Allergic rhinitis is estimated to affect 400-500 million people worldwide. Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) typically focuses on a subset of patients whose condition is not well controlled despite the use of symptom-relieving medication.
ALK estimates that, in 2015, global industry sales of AIT products grew by low single digits to around DKK 6.7 billion (EUR 0.9 billion) with Europe and the USA accounting for approximately 90% of sales.
Worldwide, SCIT is the most widely-used form of AIT, followed by SLIT-drops and SLIT-tablets. The sales of SLIT-tablets, which were first introduced in 2006, are growing fastest.
The AIT market has two major players (ALK and Stallergenes Greer) both of which have around one third of the world market.

Europe
In Europe, annual sales growth is currently in the low single digits. SCIT is the most widely used treatment, while the use of SLIT-drops is generally in decline following changes to reimbursement and documentation rules. SLIT-tablets are Europe's fastest growing AIT treatment and now account for close to 25% of total grass AIT sales. Total industry sales in Europe amount to approximately DKK 5 billion (EUR 675 million).
Germany and France are by far the largest European AIT markets and together, account for approximately 75% of the region's sales. Prescriber coverage is uneven across Europe and access to AIT reimbursement varies from country to country. GRAZAX®, for instance, is being reimbursed with minor patient co-payments in 10 countries, while other countries have put restrictions on reimbursement.
Generally, Europe is in transition from named-patient products (NPP) towards fully documented and registered products. At the end of 2014, the German national allergy associations introduced new treatment guidelines stressing the importance of prescribing registered and scientifically documented products such as GRAZAX® and ACARIZAX®. In parallel, the Netherlands

ended reimbursement of non-registered products, and Italy announced national reimbursement of GRAZAX® while removing reimbursement on all non-registered, named-patient grass products.
ALK is one of only two pan-European AIT providers in a region otherwise characterised by small, single-market companies, many of whom market nonregistered products with little in the way of scientific documentation. ALK has a market share of approximately one third and accounts for 60% of all European SLIT-tablet sales.
North America
The allergy landscape in North America is dominated by the USA, which is the largest market in the world in terms of patient numbers, however, the market structure and clinical practices are different to those in Europe where AIT treatments are distributed as finished products.
The most common AIT treatment in the USA is SCIT, or multi-allergen allergy 'shots', which are typically self-mixed or compounded from bulk allergen extracts by allergy specialists. This clinical practice, together with the services provided by allergy specialists, generates DKK

13-20 billion (USD 2-3 billion) yearly in billing to insurance companies. ALK is one of three main manufacturers of bulk allergen extracts who supply the specialists with ingredients for allergy 'shots'. Total industry sales to allergy specialists are estimated at approximately DKK 1 billion (USD 150 million) and the overall market is growing in double-digits annually. ALK has a market share of approximately 30%.
SLIT-tablets were first launched in the USA ahead of the 2015 pollen seasons, following the first ever FDA approvals for AIT products. ALK's partner, MSD (known as Merck in the USA and Canada), has exclusive rights to ALK's SLIT-tablets in North America. Ahead of the 2015 pollen seasons, MSD launched both GRASTEK® and RAGWITEK® for grass and ragweed allergies, respectively. MSD is also preparing a US regulatory filing for the SLITtablet treating house dust mite (HDM) allergy (ACARIZAX® in Europe).
Japan

Insurance System was only recently approved.
Torii, ALK's partner for Japan, is one of two AIT companies in the country. To pave the way for the SLIT-tablets, in 2014 Torii began marketing an HDM SCIT product and an HDM diagnostics product (both licensed from ALK) as well as a proprietary Japanese cedar SLIT-drops product. In December 2015, Torii launched ACARIZAX® under the local brand name MITICURETM and has also filed for approval of the Japanese cedar SLIT-tablet, licensed from ALK.
Other markets
In China, HDM allergy may affect up to 100 million people according to ALK estimates. The current market for AIT is valued at less than DKK 400 million (EUR 50 million). ALK's partner, Eddingpharm, has a registered SCIT product and a diagnostic test, both for HDM allergy, licensed from ALK. AIT is currently not reimbursed in China.

R&D pipeline and partnerships

ALK's own pipeline activities as well as those conducted in partnership with MSD, Torii, Abbott and Seqirus all made significant progress in 2015.
ALK's European R&D pipeline activities
In August 2015, ALK successfully gained approval in 11 European countries for ACARIZAX®, with the first launches taking

place in early 2016. Further regulatory submissions were also made in Switzerland and Turkey, while preparations for submissions in additional European countries are ongoing. Please turn to pages 16-17 for additional details.
ALK's other clinical development activities also progressed, including: · The multi-year GRAZAX® Asthma Pre-
vention (GAP trial) reported results in January 2016 which documented the disease-modifying effect providing patients with a long-lasting effect after the

end of treatment. The results will support ALK in its efforts to position AIT in asthma treatment and prevention · Preparations to investigate the safety and efficacy of ACARIZAX® in paediatric patients are underway · Clinical development of the tree SLIT- tablet is also ongoing and a Phase III clinical trial is due to be initiated ahead of the 2017 pollen season · A clinical trial involving AVANZ® is ongoing as part of the efforts to strengthen documentation of legacy products

the two products was generally well tolerated. In addition, MSD initiated a paediatric development programme for RAGWITEK®.
Partnership with Torii for Japan
Under its partnership agreement with ALK, Torii has exclusive rights to develop, register and commercialise ALK's AIT products for allergic rhinitis and asthma in Japan. The 2011 agreement covers SLITtablets against HDM (ACARIZAX®, branded MITICURETM in Japan) and Japanese cedar pollen allergy, as well as an HDM SCIT product and an HDM diagnostic product.
In December 2015, Torii launched ACARIZAX® in Japan under the brand name MITICURETM, following approval from Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and an agreement on price and reimbursement under the National Health Insurance System. Torii has also initiated a new clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of MITICURETM in paediatric patients.
In December 2015, Torii also submitted a New Drug Application for the SLIT-tablet against Japanese cedar pollen allergic rhinitis. The submission was based on positive results from the clinical Phase II/III trial, announced in August 2015. Subject to approval, this tablet could reach the market in 2017.

Working with Seqirus in Australia and New Zealand
ALK will receive an undisclosed milestone payment upon approval of ACARIZAX® in Australia. ALK will be responsible for product supply and will sell products to Seqirus under an agreed price structure, ensuring a split of the final in-market revenues generated by Seqirus.

Partnership with Abbott for Russia
The partnership with Abbott, established in 2014, covers the supply and marketing of ALK's SLIT-tablets for Russia. Abbott has exclusive rights to distribute and commercialise ALK's SLIT-tablets covering

grass (GRAZAX®), ragweed, tree and HDM (ACARIZAX®) allergies, adding these products to its own respiratory range.
In September 2015, a registration application for GRAZAX® in Russia was submitted based on a successful local registration trial combined with ALK's European data. Subject to approval by the authorities, GRAZAX® could be launched in Russia during 2017. In December 2015, a registration application for the ragweed SLIT-tablet was submitted. Meanwhile, preparations for the registration of ACARIZAX® are also advancing.
Partnership with Abbott for South-East Asia
In the beginning of 2016, the partnership with Abbott was expanded to cover seven South-East Asian markets: Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. In these markets, Abbott has exclusive rights to register and sell ACARIZAX®, which is a strong fit with Abbott's existing ENT and paediatrics portfolio. The population in the markets covered by this agreement totals more than 350 million people.
Regulatory submissions are expected to be based upon ALK's data package which has been approved by European authorities. This will enable a regulatory process which is expected to result in first launches from 2017. The regulatory submissions will target a label covering both allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma.

Strategy update

In 2015, the regular mid-cycle review of ALK's strategy plan reaffirmed the goal of transforming ALK from a largely European company focused on allergic rhinitis into a truly global company with a portfolio of standardised, evidence-based products which, in addition to allergic rhinitis, also treat allergic asthma and potentially prevent the onset of asthma.
The successful roll-out of ACARIZAX® is crucial to achieving this goal given that, aside from targeting the world's most prevalent allergy, the product also offers the opportunity to establish allergy immunotherapy (AIT) as a recognised and regularly

prescribed treatment for allergic asthma patients.
While the overall direction of ALK remains unchanged, the company continuously makes tactical adjustments to support sustained and long-term value creation, irrespective of revenue streams from partnerships. Accordingly, in December 2015, ALK divested its European veterinary business in line with ongoing efforts to simplify the business structure and accelerate the rationalisation of ALK's product portfolio.
Grow, Innovate and Simplify remain the cornerstones of ALK's strategic framework.

Grow
ALK intends to grow revenue in its base business through product innovation and by allocating resources to market-building activities. An important initiative in that respect is Allergy Unlocked®, an umbrella name for activities designed to broaden access to evidence-based AIT for patients whose disease is not well controlled despite the use of symptom-relieving medications. Allergy Unlocked® is centred around five main activities: addressing the burden of disease for patients and society, driving evidence-based care, broadening access to care, facilitating diagnosis and intervention by reassuring doctors of the clinical benefits of AIT, and making patients aware of AIT.

GROW

SIMPL

These efforts fit well with recent AIT market trends in Europe which favour evidencebased medicines such as ACARIZAX® and GRAZAX®. For instance, in Germany, treatment guidelines have been updated, highlighting the differences between products and the importance of prescribing registered and scientifically documented AIT products. Italy has provided national reimbursement for GRAZAX® for the first time, while removing reimbursement on all non-registered, named-patient grass products, and the Netherlands has phased out reimbursement of non-registered, namedpatient products.

Outside Europe, ALK continues to target growth in markets such as North America, Japan and China, while also expanding its geographic reach into new growth markets ­ either by setting up affiliates or by entering into partnerships whereby ALK retains long-term control of the markets.

years, but ALK remains focused on executing its strategy of geographical expansion.
Innovate
ALK's R&D pipeline has the potential to redefine the treatment of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Hence, focus remains on completing a SLIT-tablet portfolio covering the most common global allergies and further documenting the tablets' benefits in asthma treatment and asthma prevention.
Following the launches of ACARIZAX® in Europe and in Japan, where it is known as MITICURETM, attention is now directed towards activities that will secure market access in key countries in Europe, North America and South-East Asia as well as other countries, including Russia, Australia and China. This will involve trials to support paediatric use.
To complete the SLIT-tablet portfolio, ALK will advance the development of the product against tree pollen allergy in Europe and support Torii as the product against Japanese cedar pollen allergy is reviewed by authorities in Japan.

tor to earnings during ALK's transformation into a truly global, specialty pharmaceutical company.
The Portfolio Optimisation Programme aims to transform ALK's product portfolio into one centred around evidence-based products. The programme is expected to phase out a number of older products and variants in Europe. The transformation will eventually reduce costs and documentation workload, enable economies of scale in the supply chain and allow ALK to focus sales and marketing efforts on fewer high-volume products. The programme will also be extended, wherever meaningful.
In parallel, ALK continues to consolidate its production network. Moreover, further steps will be taken to optimise processes and increase capacity. The Focus 2018 strategy assumes average annual investments of approximately DKK 200 million and much of this is aimed at increasing tablet production capacity. In its administrative functions, ALK will continue to optimise structures, processes and governance.
Strategic growth outlook

influenced by the current market situation in France and other European markets.
In addition to base business growth, the SLIT-tablet partnerships are expected to contribute to overall revenue growth (excluding milestone payments). ALK continues to take a conservative view of the SLIT-tablet sales uptake in 2016 in markets outside Europe but expects growth to accelerate from 2017 provided that ACARIZAX® is launched in North America, Russia, Australia and South-East Asia.
In North America, the challenge of structural barriers still has to be overcome. Currently, allergy specialists favour compounded, multi-allergen 'shots' and the concept of pre-allergy season treatment initiation is new, as is the concept of single-allergen treatments. Still, ALK retains confidence in the long-term potential for SLIT-tablets given the significant number of eligible patients who have refused 'shots' or have abandoned SCIT treatment. A wider adoption of SLIT-tablets may occur once the HDM SLIT-tablet reaches the North American markets, allowing MSD to offer a complete tablet portfolio which addresses all three main respiratory allergies.

ALK will also conduct development and documentation work to support existing products in Europe. Furthermore, ALK will increasingly add resources to explore new technologies for the next generation of AIT.
Simplify
Efficiencies generated through the Simplify programme remain an important contribu-

In line with the medium-term strategic growth outlook (nine-month interim report, 14 November 2014), ALK in general continues to project organic, annual revenue growth in the base business of 0-5% in the years beyond 2016. Base business growth is expected at the higher end of the range when the roll-out of ACARIZAX® and other new products, combined with the benefits of geographical expansion, take full effect. The strategic growth outlook may, however, be

The roll-out of ACARIZAX®

ACARIZAX® was launched in Japan, under the name MITICURETM, in December 2015, and in Germany and Denmark during January 2016.
Following the launches in Denmark and Germany, ALK will proceed with price and reimbursement negotiations in the nine other countries covered by the European registration: Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden. Meanwhile, ALK is preparing for further registrations in Europe. It may, however, take several years before roll-out in Europe is complete due to differing levels of complexity in local pricing and reimbursement processes.
Addressing an unmet medical need ACARIZAX® is the first and only SLIT-tablet targeting both allergic rhinitis and aller-

gic asthma. The unmet medical need is substantial. In Europe, approximately three million adults and one million children and adolescents are estimated to be diagnosed with moderate to severe house dust mite (HDM) allergy and have a condition which is not well controlled despite the use of symptom-relieving medication (nasal steroids, antihistamines, etc.) ALK estimates that approximately 50% of these patients have access to allergy immunotherapy (AIT) with partial or full reimbursement, so the addressable market for ACARIZAX® in Europe in the initial phase potentially consists of approximately 1.5 million adults and 0.5 million children and adolescents. For comparison, 400-450,000 HDM allergy patients are treated with SCIT and SLIT-drops in Europe today.

The house dust mite
House dust mites feed on organic material such as skin cells shed by humans and animals. The tiny creatures, measuring 0.25 millimetres in length, thrive in mattresses, pillows, carpets, couches, clothes and soft toys. Today, humans typically spend most of their time indoors and, despite efforts to sanitise indoor spaces, dust mites remain the most common cause of respiratory allergy in the world. Mite allergen includes both the mites and their airborne faeces, which can cause symptoms even after the mites' death. Unlike some allergies, which are seasonal, house dust mite allergy is typically present all year round.

ACARIZAX® is indicated in adult patients (1865 years) diagnosed by a clinical history and by a positive test of HDM sensitisation with at least one of the following conditions: · Persistent moderate to severe HDM al-
lergic rhinitis despite the use of symptomrelieving medication · HDM allergic asthma which is not well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and is associated with mild to severe HDM allergic rhinitis.
Patient's asthma status must be carefullly evaluated before treatment.
ALK will work in close partnership with allergy specialists to introduce ACARIZAX® to European patients. The launch of the product has the potential to be a catalyst for improving patient access to AIT across the continent. The longer-term adoption

of ACARIZAX® by other medical specialities could potentially ease the problem of access in countries where allergy specialists are in short supply.
ACARIZAX®
ACARIZAX® contains standardised allergen extract from the house dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae 12 SQ-HDM* per tablet.

ACARIZAX® in asthma
ACARIZAX® is the first and only SLIT-tablet to be broadly approved for use in allergic asthma. Because it addresses the cause of HDM respiratory allergic disease, it has a clinical effect on both the upper and lower airways, and the underlying protection it provides leads to improvement in disease control and improved quality of life through symptom relief, reduced need for other medications and a reduced risk of asthma attacks.

Respiratory diseases
Allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma are respiratory diseases affecting the upper and lower airways.
Allergic rhinitis is an inflammation affecting the upper airways and the membranes of the nose and eyes. The disease is accompanied by nasal symptoms such as sneezing, running nose, nasal congestion and itching. Conjunctivitis (red, watery and itchy eyes) often accompanies this condition. Allergic rhinitis is the most common childhood allergy and can be a strong predictor for developing allergic asthma.
Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammation affecting the lower airways. The bronchial mucosa swells, narrowing the airways and reducing air supply to the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in the chest and coughing. Asthma often starts early in life and is the most common chronic lower respiratory disease in children.
The European Respiratory Health Survey shows that HDM-allergic patients' risk of developing asthma is significantly higher than that of other allergy patients. Approximately 50% of patients with HDM allergic rhinitis also suffer from allergic asthma, while the vast majority of patients who have HDM allergic asthma also have allergic rhinitis. In addition, around 50% of asthmatic patients are reported to be sensitised to HDM.

Continue work to simplify the business structure

2016 financial outlook
Growth rates are shown as organic growth rates in local currencies, unless otherwise stated.
ALK's financial performance in 2016 will be influenced by the unfolding market situation in France, Europe's second largest allergy immunotherapy market where, in December 2015, authorities ordered ALK's main competitor to temporarily suspend production and recall certain products. This has also had ramifications in several European markets and has resulted in an unusually large order intake, especially in France.

significant in H1, whereafter the market in H2 is expected to gradually normalise.
For 2016, ALK currently expects base business revenue of approximately DKK 2.6 billion (2015: DKK 2.4 billion). ALK's partnerships are expected to generate additional revenue. Excluding sales royalties and milestone payments from partners, EBITDA before special items is expected at approximately DKK 450 million (2015: DKK 331 million). ALK will provide regular updates during 2016 as the situation in the European markets becomes clearer and its consequences more apparent.

ALK has decided to provide a base case financial outlook, which includes an estimated positive impact by the market situation on revenue and earnings in 2016 based, amongst other things, on current order intake. The impact is likely going to be most

Base business revenue
When including a positive effect from the recent market development in France, in the base case financial outlook, ALK expects to

grow its base business revenue organically by approximately 10% in local currencies to approximately DKK 2.6 billion (2015: DKK 2.4 billion).
Revenue from SLIT-tablets in Europe is projected to grow by double-digits, driven by continued higher uptake of GRAZAX® and the introduction of ACARIZAX®. Jext® and diagnostics are expected to be additional sources of growth. SCIT/SLIT-drops revenue is expected to show single digit growth.
In Germany, Europe's largest market, ALK assumes that treatment guidelines will continue to strengthen demand for evidencebased products such as GRAZAX® and ACARIZAX® while simultaneously weakening sales of named-patient products.
Outside Europe, ALK anticipates continued double-digit revenue growth from its North American allergen extracts business which

will continue to benefit from attractive growth opportunities. Revenue from International markets is also expected to grow.
Revenue from partnerships
ALK's SLIT-tablet partnerships will generate additional revenue in the form of sales royalties, product supply, R&D service fees and, potentially, milestone payments.
In 2016, overall income from these partnerships is expected to decline (2015: DKK 185 million) due to significantly lower milestone payments compared with last year.
In 2016 and 2017, ALK may receive total milestone payments of around DKK 75 million (2015: DKK 116 million) from the partnerships in North America and Australia as a result of possible registrations of the HDM SLIT-tablet (ACARIZAX®).
Moreover, ALK will recognise income from sales royalties and product supply in Japan following the launch of MITICURETM and in North America where GRASTEK® and

RAGWITEK® are entering their second pollen season.
ALK continues to take a conservative view of SLIT-tablet sales uptake during the first few years after launch. SLIT-tablets represent a new treatment class in Japan, where AIT still is in its infancy. And while AIT is a wellknown treatment in North America, the first year after launch showed that the tablets face structural barriers that need to be addressed.
Consistent with its previous practice, ALK is not providing a specific 2016 outlook for sales royalties and milestone payments but intends to provide regular updates in its interim reports.
Production costs
Production costs are expected to increase driven by a number of factors. Most notably, a significant growth in tablet volumes as ALK builds stock to supply the new market introductions. This build-up entails additional staff and operating expenses, such as higher Quality Assurance costs and increased depreciation as new production

equipment is put into operation. Furthermore, ALK continues its efforts to rapidly increase its production capacity for SLITdrops in France to meet demand.
In addition to increased production and depreciation costs, gross margins are expected to be negatively impacted by changes in the sales mix trending towards higher sales of lower-margin products, and by the decline in expected milestone payments.
All in all, this translates into an expected decline in the reported gross margin (2015: 67%) in the base case scenario.
Capacity costs
ALK aims to complete clinical development of the SLIT-tablet portfolio as quickly as possible. R&D expenses are expected to remain largely unchanged at DKK 400 million (2015: DKK 407million). Expenses will mainly be driven by ACARIZAX®, with further registration and clinical activities, as well as activities related to the late-stage clinical development of a tree SLIT-tablet.

Sales and marketing expenses as well as administrative expenses are projected to increase marginally (2015: total of DKK 1,033 million). The increase is partly due to increased promotional activities for ACARIZAX® although these will be somewhat offset by savings under the Simplify programme.
Operating income (EBITDA)
ALK expects to see an increased operating income in 2016 primarily as a consequence of improved revenue growth in the base business. Excluding sales royalties and milestone payments from partners, EBITDA before special items is expected at approximately DKK 450 million in the base case financial outlook (2015: 331 million).
ALK will continue its efforts under the Simplify programme to improve operational efficiencies and capture cost savings where possible. The simplification of production and business structures is expected to entail minor restructuring costs which will be re-

ported in a special items line. Special items are projected at around DKK 30 million (2015: DKK 1 million which was influenced by a gain from the divestment of ALK's European veterinary business).
Investments and cash flow
CAPEX is projected at around DKK 200 million (2015: DKK 199 million). Major projects include the upscaling of SLIT-tablet production capacity, construction of a new API manufacturing line for the tree SLIT-tablet, expansion of Jext® production capacity, as well as the optimisation of SCIT, SLIT-drops and diagnostics production capabilities.
Free cash flow is expected to be largely level with 2015 (2015: positive free cash flow of DKK 18 million). In 2016, ALK expects to receive significantly lower milestone payments.
The outlook is based on current exchange rates.

Forward-looking statements
This report contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of future revenue and operating profit, as well as expected business-related events. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various factors, some of which are beyond ALK's control, may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from the forecasts made in this report.
Without being exhaustive, such factors include general economic and business-related conditions including legal issues, uncertainty relating to demand, pricing, reimbursement rules, partners' plans and forecasts, fluctuations in exchange rates, reliance on suppliers, as well as changes to market structures. An additional factor would be the consequences of potential side effects from the use of ALK's products, as allergy immunotherapy may be associated with allergic reactions of differing extents, duration and severity.

Risk management

ALK's Board of Management is responsible for the on-going management of risk, including risk mapping, assessment of probabilities and potential consequences, and the introduction of risk-reducing measures. Board of Management has established a Risk Committee to assist it in meeting its overall responsibility for risk management. Risk management reports are given to the Board of Directors' audit committee on an annual basis.
The following risks are of particular significance to ALK:
Commercial risks
Risks related to research and development
Future success depends on ALK's ability to maintain current products and successfully identify, develop and market new, innovative drugs, which involves significant risks. A new pharmaceutical product must be subjected to extensive and lengthy clinical trials to document aspects such as safety and efficacy before it can be approved for marketing. In the course of the development process, the outcome of these trials is subject to significant risks. Even though substantial resources are invested in the development process, the trials may produce negative results. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals ­ or failure to obtain such approvals ­ may also have a major impact on the ability of ALK to achieve its long-term goals. ALK and its collaborative partners perform thorough risk assessments of its research and development programmes throughout the development and registration processes with the objective of risk mitigation to optimise the likelihood of the products reaching the market.

Risks related to market conditions
Regulation and price control ALK's products are subject to a large number of statutory and regulatory requirements with respect to issues such as safety, efficacy and production. In most of the countries in which ALK operates, prescription drugs are subject to reimbursement from, and price controls by, national authorities. This often results in major price differences between individual markets. Regulatory requirements and intervention, as well as price controls, may therefore have a significant impact on the company's earnings capacity. ALK actively engages in dialogue with the authorities aimed at securing fair pricing and reimbursement agreements.
Commercialisation If ALK and its partners succeed in developing new products and obtaining regulatory approval for them, the ability to generate revenue depends on the products being accepted by doctors and patients. The degree of market acceptance for a new product depends on a number of factors, including the demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, convenience and ease of administration, potential advantages over alternative treatment methods, competition, and marketing and distribution support. If ALK's new products fail to achieve market acceptance, this could have a significant influence on the company's ability to generate revenue.
ALK regularly conducts extensive surveys of market conditions and similar factors and spends significant resources on providing information on its products to doctors and patients. Commercialisation is a crucial part of the company's strategic basis and its strategic activities.
ALK's products may be associated with allergic reactions of varying extents, dura-

tions and severities. If such events occur in unexpected situations, they may have an impact on the company's earnings and sales. Due to the potentially serious consequences, it is crucial for ALK to stringently monitor product quality and safety, both in clinical development and in sales and marketing activities. If, despite the high level of quality and safety, a situation should occur in which it is necessary to recall a product, ALK has procedures in place to ensure that this can be managed swiftly and efficiently.
Competition ALK operates in markets characterised by intense competition. If, for instance, a competitor launches a new and more effective treatment for allergy, it may have a material impact on ALK's sales. A competitive market may also lead to market-driven price reductions just as the regulatory authorities may dictate price reductions. Both competition and price changes are risks that may have a material impact on ALK's ability to achieve its long-term goals. ALK therefore monitors economic developments, the competitive situation and initiatives in all important markets with the aim of appropriate risk mitigation.
Risks related to infrastructure
Production and quality ALK has concentrated most of its production capacity at plants in Denmark, France, Spain and the USA. Although the plants are located in areas that have not historically been affected by natural disasters, this geographical diversification calls for risk planning in order to avoid emergency situations, such as lack of, or poor access to raw materials: for instance, pollen. This planning includes the prevention of unwanted events and preventative inventory management; such as the build-up of contingency inventories in order to ensure an unbroken chain of production and supply.

Production and manufacturing processes are also subject to periodic and routine inspections by the regulatory authorities as a regular part of their monitoring process in order to ensure that all manufacturers observe the prescribed requirements and standards. Meeting these quality standards is a prerequisite for the company's license to operate. ALK's production processes and quality standards have been developed and optimised over many years.
Dependence on third parties ALK has partnership agreements with third parties with a view to commercialising the company's products in a number of markets and with external parties supplying important input to key production processes. Although there are financial incentives for all of ALK's partners to fulfil their contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that they will actually do so. The factors that motivate ALK's partners to develop and commercialise products may be affected by conditions and decisions beyond ALK's control.
The agreements with Merck & Co. Inc and Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd entitle ALK to receive certain milestone payments. These payments depend on continuing favourable results in the development of the pharmaceutical products to which ALK's partners hold licensing rights. Moreover, reliance on suppliers and third-party manufacturers entails risks which ALK would not be subject to if the company possessed the necessary in-house manufacturing capabilities. Such risks include but are not limited to:
· Reliance on a third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance
· Possible breach of a manufacturing agreement by a third party due to factors beyond ALK's control and influence
· Reliance on the ability of a third party to deliver and scale up the volume of production

ALK manages these risks through contracts, thorough planning and monitoring and through joint steering committees that work together with these external parties.
Risks related to key employees
ALK is dependent on its ability to attract and retain employees in key positions. A loss of key employees may have a material impact on the company's marketing and research efforts. ALK manages this risk, among other things, by continuously offering its staff professional development opportunities and competitive compensation.
Risks related to business ethics and legal issues
Business ethics ALK's good reputation is essential for operating within the pharmaceutical industry. ALK aims to maintain its standing by acting in compliance with all applicable regulation and legislation. ALK strives to act professionally, honestly and with high integrity throughout the company in relation to stakeholders, from customers, employees and shareholders, to society, suppliers and partners. ALK's Code of Conduct is updated regularly and defines ALK's high standard of ethical behaviour.
Patents and intellectual property rights Patents and other intellectual property rights are important for developing and retaining ALK's competitive strength. The risk that ALK might infringe patents or trademark rights held by other companies, as well as the risk that other companies may attempt to infringe the patents and/ or trademark rights of ALK, are monitored and, if necessary, suitable measures are taken.

Risks related to financial reporting
ALK's risk management and internal controls relating to financial reporting are designed to effectively control the risk of material misstatements. A detailed description of ALK's internal controls and risk management system in relation to financial reporting processes is included in the Statutory Corporate Governance Statement, cf. section 107b of the Danish Financial Statement Act available at the company's website: http://ir.alk-abello.com/risk.cfm
Financial risks
Due to the nature of its operations, investments and financing, ALK is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates. The ALK Group's financial risks are managed centrally, based on policies approved by the Board of Directors. The objective of ALK's financial risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and changes in credit rating. Group policy is to refrain from active financial speculation. See note 28 of this annual report for a specification of the Group's hedging of currency, interest rate and credit risks and the use of derivative financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk The general objective of ALK's foreign exchange risk management is to limit and delay any adverse impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow and thus increase the predictability of the financial results.
The most significant financial risk for ALK relates to exchange rate fluctuations. The greatest exposure is to USD and GBP. In 2015, 16% of ALK's revenue was denom

inated in USD, 2% in GBP and 73% in EUR. ALK's sales are not deemed to be exposed to EUR due to Denmark's participation in the European exchange rate cooperation.
The table below shows the estimated effect of a 10% increase in the USD and GBP exchange rates on revenue and EBITDA levels, respectively. Exchange rate risks relating to operations are primarily hedged by matching receipts and payments in the same currencies and by forward exchange contracts and options.

Moreover, ALK is exposed to exchange rate risks when intercompany balances and net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK. In accordance with accounting policies, such currency translation adjustments are recognised in the income state-

ment and in other comprehensive income, respectively.
Foreign exchange exposure relating to future transactions and assets and liabilities is evaluated and hedged by instruments such as forward exchange contracts. This serves to limit the impact on the financial results of any exchange rate fluctuations. The exchange rate exposure relating to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is not hedged by forward exchange contracts.
Interest rate and liquidity exposure At the end of the financial year, net interestbearing assets stood at approximately DKK 600 million. A change in the interest rate level by 1 percentage point would, consequently, correspond to a change in interest income of approximately DKK 6 million. It is not expected that the interest rate exposure will be hedged as this is not considered financially viable.
Cash is invested in credit-worthy, liquid, interest-bearing instruments of relatively short duration. The liquidity risk is consider ed to be minimal due to the company's current capital structure.

Net assets are defined as assets less liabilities

Credit exposure The credit exposure in connection with financial instruments is managed by contracting only with institutions with satisfactory credit-worthiness, in Denmark as well as abroad. In accordance with ALK's creditrisk policy, such institutions must have an acknowledged credit rating.
Trade receivables are monitored closely at the local level and are distributed on a number of markets and customers. The credit risk is therefore considered to be low.

Corporate matters

Corporate governance
ALK's Statutory Corporate Governance Statement for the financial year 2015, pursuant to section 107b of the Danish Financial Statement Act, is available at http://ir.alk-abello.com/risk.cfm
The statement provides a detailed account of ALK's management structure including the Board of Directors' composition, activities, remuneration and self-assessment. The statement furthermore describes key elements of ALK's internal controls and risk management systems relating to financial reporting processes.
As a listed company, ALK is subject to the recommendations of the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. ALK fulfils this obligation either by complying with the recommendations or by explaining the reason for non-compliance. ALK complies with 46 of the 47 recommendations. The Board of Directors' `comply or explain' review of all 47 guidelines is available at http://ir.alk-abello.com/guidelines.cfm
At the annual general meeting in March 2015, Steen Riisgaard was re-elected Chairman of the Board of Directors and Lene Skole was elected Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. The shareholders elected Lars Holmqvist and Per Valstorp as new members of the Board of Directors instead of Christian Dyvig and Thorleif Krarup who did not seek re-election. Anders Gersel Pedersen and Jakob Riis were re-elected.
At the annual general meeting in March 2016, ALK will propose that the remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors remains unchanged.

Corporate Social Responsibility
ALK's Statutory Report on Corporate Social Responsibility for the financial year 2015, pursuant to sections 99a and 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act, is available at http://www.alk-abello.com/ aboutalk/csr/AnnualCSRReports/Pages/ home.aspx
The report provides a detailed account of the foundation for Corporate Social Responsibility in ALK, namely the Code of Conduct and the CSR Policy. The Code of Conduct describes the ethical requirements for all employees' behaviour in relation to customers, employees, shareholders, society, suppliers and partners. The Code of Conduct supports and integrates UN Global Compact's 10 principles in the areas of human and labour rights, environment and anti-corruption. Based on the Code of Conduct, and anchored in ALK's core values, the CSR Policy outlines current priorities and focus areas. The CSR Policy is implemented via various policies and procedures, including HR policies, SHE (Safety, Health & Environment) action plans and organisations, quality procedures etc.
The Statutory Report on Corporate Social Responsibility furthermore reviews ALK's actual performance in the focus areas, measured by a number of Key Performance Indicators. In January 2015, Management adopted new global, long-term environmental goals for 2015-18. The new targets continue to focus on energy and CO2 emission, but efforts have also been extended to encompass water usage.

The objective is that absolute energy consumption by the end of 2018 must not exceed 2014 levels and by the end of 2018, CO2 emissions must be 5% down on 2014. Reflecting the fact that clean water is particularly scarce in Europe, the goal is that water usage in Europe by the end of 2018 must not exceed 2014 levels.
Shareholder information
The aim is that the share price offers a fair presentation of ALK and reflects the company's actual and expected ability to create shareholder value. ALK would further like the share to be liquid and to have a sound foundation to allow for efficient pricing and trading in the share.
Ownership At the end of the year, ALK had 14,695 registered shareholders ­ a slight increase over 2014 (14,203). The registered shareholders own 96% of the share capital (95).
As of 31 December 2015, three shareholders have notified shareholdings of 5% or more: Lundbeckfonden has a 40.3% interest (including A shares), ATP has a 5.1% interest and Invesco Canada has a 6.2% interest. 27 of the 30 largest shareholders are international institutional investors, from North America, the UK and Scandinavia in particular. The international ownership is estimated at approximately 22% (20), representing 39% of the free float of the share capital (36).
ALK's holding of own shares was reduced following settlement of share option and

conditional share programmes. At the end of the year, ALK held 361,051 or 3.6% of own shares (4.6% at the end of 2014) which is considered sufficient to cover current share option obligations.
Return and liquidity ALK aims to provide long-term shareholder return through an increased share price, the paying-out of dividends and the purchase of own shares.
At the end of 2014, the share price was DKK 651 and the share closed 2015 at DKK 876. Including payment of a dividend of DKK 5 per share, the return on each ALK share was 35%. By comparison, the Danish benchmark OMXC20 index increased by 36% and the Nordic MidCap index by 40%.
Dividend and capital structure The Board of Directors submits a recommendation for the dividend on the basis of ALK's earnings, risk, strategy, capital resources, investment plans and prospects. At the annual general meeting in March 2016, the Board of Directors proposes an unchanged dividend of DKK 5 per share.
The Board of Directors reviews ALK's capital structure on an ongoing basis. The Board considers that the current capital structure is appropriate, relative to ALK's strategy. ALK is well consolidated, with strong liquidity, reasonable debt obligations and stable earnings. Consequently, ALK is able to make the necessary investments in R&D, supply chain and growth initiatives, and this financial strength also facilitates acquisitions.

Investor Relations Based on its IR Policy (http://ir.alk-abello. com/policy.cfm) ALK seeks to provide timely, accurate and relevant information on matters of importance to the assessment of the share, including strategy, operations, performance, expectations, pipeline, market development, etc. ALK furthermore continuously works to strengthen the dialogue with all financial stakeholders in accordance with good IR practice and the provisions for companies listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen.
Besides hosting regular telephone conferences, ALK representatives held approximately 250 individual meetings with analysts and investors in 2015 and also presented at various conferences.
During the year, ALK published 24 company announcements (37), including reports on transactions by managerial staff. All announcements are available on the website together with e-newsletters, reports, presentations, telephone conferences, share price information, estimates from the analysts following the share, etc. Registered shareholders are encouraged to sign up at the InvestorPortal.

Lundbeckfonden
Lundbeckfonden is one of the largest industrial foundations in Denmark with a total market value of its commercial activities of approximately DKK 50 billion and an annually spend of DKK 400-500 million in grants to support biomedical research of the highest, international quality.

Remuneration is structured to offer a balance between fixed and performance-based pay to ensure ALK is able to attract and retain key personnel. The structure also serves to incentivise management to create long-term value for shareholders.
In addition to a fixed salary, pension and otherstandard, non-monetary benefits, Board of Management members are eligible for a performance-related cash bonus, capped at the equivalent of nine months' salary for the CEO and six months' salary for other Board of Management members.
In addition, Board of Management members are granted share options and conditional shares, the value of which may not exceed 30% of the combined base salaries and pension of the Board of Management.
Grants to Board of Management members are shown in the table left and are described in detail in note 5. Total Board of Management remuneration appears in note 4.

Financial review*

Revenue grew by 2% in local currencies to DKK 2,569 million (2,433). Developments in exchange rates impacted reported growth positively by approximately 4 percentage points.
Revenue in the base business came out higher than expected at DKK 2,384 million (2,219) following 4% growth. Base business growth was 5% excluding last year's upfront payment from ALK's collaboration partner in China. Conversely, income from the SLIT-tablet partnerships was down, as expected, to DKK 185 million (214) due to lower milestone and upfront payments.
Cost of sales totalled DKK 836 million (736) and gross profit was DKK 1,733 million (1,697), which corresponds to a gross margin of 67% (70). The gross margin was, as foreseen, negatively influenced by lower upfront and milestone payments, changes in the base business' sales mix as well as the build-up of capacity to supply partners with SLIT-tablets. The normalised gross margin, excluding milestone payments, was 66% (67).
Capacity costs increased 4% ­ and 1% in local currencies ­ to DKK 1,440 million (1,388). Research and development expenses increased slightly by 3% (1% in local currencies) and corresponded to 16% of revenue (16). Administrative expenses were down 5% (6% in local currencies) while sales and marketing expenses rose

6% (3% in local currencies). This reflected the planned step up of market-building activities ahead of the European launch of ACARIZAX® as well as efforts to support ALK's geographical expansion.
Throughout the year, ALK maintained a strong focus on the strategic initiatives under the Simplify programme to drive efficiency improvements and reduce costs. As a result, the capacity costs-to-revenue ratio decreased slightly to 56% (57) despite extra allocations to sales, marketing and production build-up.
EBITDA (operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) before special items was DKK 452 million (453). Excluding sales royalties and milestone payments, EBITDA before special items advanced to DKK 331million (273).
After special items of DKK -1 million (-49), reported EBITDA increased to DKK 451 million (404), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 18% (17%). Special items were mainly costs related to the restructuring of the Product Supply organisation and the commercial organisation in the Netherlands. Special items also included the net gain from the divestment of the European veterinary business.
Operating profit (EBIT) was DKK 292 million (264), corresponding to an EBIT margin of 11% (11).

Net financials were a gain of DKK 108 million (a gain of 36) due to unrealised exchange rate gains on USD and CHF intercompany loans.
Tax on the profit was DKK 56 million (119). The relatively low effective tax rate of 14% (40) was impacted by a one-off positive tax adjustment of DKK 74 million in Q2 following the transfer of activities from the Swiss subsidiary to the Danish parent company.
Net profit for the year was DKK 344 million (181).
Cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of DKK 183 million (an inflow of 320). Cash flow was negatively impacted by lower milestone and upfront payments as well as by changes in working capital, largely due to build-up of HDM SLIT-tablet inventories.
Cash flow from investment activities was an outflow of DKK 165 million (an outflow of 219) which primarily related to the continued build-up of capacity for tablet production. The cash flow also included the divestment of ALK's European veterinary business.
Free cash flow was an inflow of DKK 18 million (an inflow of 101). Lower milestone and upfront payments were only partly offset by gains from the divestment of the European veterinary business.

Cash flow from financing saw an inflow of DKK 298 million (an outflow of 124) as dividend payments and net cash settlement of share options were counterbalanced by a new 20-year mortgage-backed loan of DKK 351 million (net) which ALK took out to strengthen its financial position. A minor part of the proceeds from this loan was used to pay back existing loans of DKK 21 million.

ALK's holding of own shares was reduced following settlement of share option and conditional share programmes. At the end of 2015, ALK held 361,051 own shares or 3.6% of the share capital (4.6% at the end of 2014).
At the end of the year, cash and marketable securities totalled DKK 608 million (289).

Equity totalled DKK 2,697 million (2,354) at the end of 2015, and the equity ratio was 63% (69%).

Statement by Management on the annual report

The Board of Directors and the Board of Management have today considered and approved the annual report of ALK-Abelló A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2015.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. In addition, the annual report has been prepared in accord-

ance with Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent's financial position at 31 December 2015 as well as of their financial performance and the Group's cash flow for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2015.
We believe that the management review contains a fair review of the development

and performance of the Group's and the Parent's business and of their position as well as the Parent's financial position and the financial position as a whole of the entities included in the consolidated financial statements, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group and the Parent face.
We recommend the annual report for adoption at the annual general meeting.

Independent auditor's report

To the shareholders of ALK-Abelló A/S

Report on the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements We have audited the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements of ALK-Abelló A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2015, which comprise the income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including the accounting policies, for the Group as well as the Parent, and the statement of comprehensive income and the cash flow statement of the Group. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies, and the parent financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2015, and of the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Further, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the Parent's financial position at 31 December 2015, and of the results of its operations for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2015 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Statement on the management's review Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act we have read the management's review. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements.
On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the management's review is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1 Accounting policies
General
The consolidated financial statements for the period 1 January ­ 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies. Additional Danish disclosure requirements for the annual reports are imposed by the Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS issued under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is also the functional currency of the parent company.
The consolidated financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis, apart from certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value. Otherwise, the accounting policies are as described below. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.
Effect of new financial reporting standards The ALK Group has implemented all new and amended standards and interpretations (IFRIC) which are effective for the financial year 2015. A number of IFRS standards, amended standards and IFRIC interpretations which are effective on or after 1 January 2016 have not been implemented. It is estimated that these standards and interpretations are deemed to have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the coming years.
The consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of ALK-Abelló A/S (the parent company) and companies (subsidiaries) controlled by the parent company. The parent company is considered to control a subsidiary when it holds, directly and indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or is otherwise able to exercise or actually exercises a controlling influence.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the financial statements of ALK-Abelló A/S and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are prepared as a consolidation of items of a uniform nature. The financial statements used for consolidation are prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.
On consolidation, intra-group income and expenses, intra-group balances and dividends, and gains and losses arising on intra-group transactions are eliminated.

Business combinations Newly acquired or newly established companies and activities are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or establishment. The date of acquisition is the date when control of the company or activity actually passes to the Group. Companies sold or discontinued are recognised in the consolidated income statement up to the date of disposal. The date of disposal is the date when control of the company actually passes to a third party.
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method, according to which the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of companies acquired are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Non-current assets held for sale are, however, measured at fair value less expected costs to sell.
Restructuring costs are only recognised in the take-over balance sheet if they represent a liability to the acquired company. The tax effect of revaluations is taken into account.
The cost of a company or activity is the fair value of the consideration paid. If the final determination of the consideration is conditional on one or more future events these are recognised at their fair value as of the acquisition date.
Costs that can be attributed directly to the transfer of ownership are recognised in the income statement when they are defrayed. As a general rule, adjustments to estimates of conditional consideration are recognised directly to the income statement.
If the fair value of the acquired assets or liabilities subsequently proves different from the values calculated at the acquisition date, cost is adjusted for up to 12 months after the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of an acquired company or activity over the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (goodwill) is recognised as an asset under intangible assets and tested for impairment at least once a year. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the lower recoverable amount.
In connection with the transition to IFRS in 2005/06, the ALK Group chose to apply the optional exemption in IFRS 1, under which business combinations effected before 1 September 2004 are not adjusted in accordance with the provisions of IFRS, except that identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are separated from the calculated

goodwill and recognised as separate items under intangible assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries are stated as the difference between the disposal amount and the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill at the date of disposal, accumulated foreign exchange adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income, and anticipated disposal costs. The disposal amount is measured as the fair value of the consideration received.
Foreign currency translation On initial recognition, transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at average exchange rates, which are an approximation of the exchange rates at the transaction date. Receivables and debt and other monetary items not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the closing rate.
Exchange rate differences between the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and the exchange rate at the date of payment or the balance sheet date, respectively, are recognised in the income statement under financial items. Tangible assets and intangible assets, inventories and other non-monetary assets acquired in foreign currency and measured based on historical cost are translated at the exchange rates at the transaction date. Non-monetary items revalued at fair value are translated at the exchange rates at the revaluation date.
On recognition in the consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries whose financial statements are presented in a functional currency other than DKK, the income statements are translated at average exchange rates for the respective months, unless these deviate materially from the actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. In that case, the actual exchange rates are used. Balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Goodwill is considered to belong to the acquired company in question and is translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
Exchange rate differences arising on the translation of foreign subsidiaries' opening balance sheet items to the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and on the translation of the income statements from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign exchange rate adjustment of receivables or debt to subsidiaries which are considered part of the parent company's overall in-

vestment in the subsidiary in question are also recognised in other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as fair value hedges of a recognised asset or a recognised liability are recognised in the income statement together with any changes in the value of the hedged asset or hedged liability.

the year is recognised in the income statement, and the tax expense relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity, respectively, is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Exchange rate adjustments of deferred tax are recognised as part of the adjustment of deferred tax for the year.
Current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as the expected tax on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax paid on account.
The current tax charge for the year is calculated based on the tax rates and rules enacted at the balance sheet date.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as effective hedges of future transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income. When the hedged transactions are realised, cumulative changes are recognised as part of the cost of the transactions in question. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. On disposal of the foreign subsidiary in question, the cumulative changes are transferred to the income statement.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognised as financial items in the income statement as they occur.
Share-based incentive plans Share-based incentive plans (equity-settled share-based payments) which comprise share option plans and conditional share plans are measured at the grant date at fair value and recognised in the income statement under the respective functions over the vesting period. The balancing item is recognised in equity.
The fair value of share options is determined using the Black & Scholes-model.
The share option agreements entitle ALK to demand cash settlement of the options. Cashsettled share options are recognised as other liabilities and adjusted to fair value when ALK has an obligation to settle in cash. The subsequent adjustment to fair value is recognised in the income statement under financial income or financial expenses.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises the year's current tax and changes in deferred tax. The tax expense relating to the profit/loss for

Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of a transaction, apart from business combinations, and where the temporary difference existing at the date of initial recognition affects neither profit/loss for the year nor taxable income. Deferred tax is calculated based on the planned use of each asset and settlement of each liability, respectively. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and tax rules that, based on legislation enacted or in reality enacted at the balance sheet date, are expected to apply in the respective countries when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changed tax rates or rules are recognised in the income statement, in other comprehensive income or in equity, depending on where the deferred tax was originally recognised. Deferred tax related to equity transactions is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised in the balance sheet at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either through a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net assets to be offset against future positive taxable income. At each balance sheet date, it is reassessed whether it is likely that there will be sufficient future taxable income for the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
The parent company is included in national joint taxation with Lundbeckfonden and its Danish subsidiaries. The tax charge for the year is allocated among the jointly taxed companies in proportion to the taxable incomes of individual companies, taking into account taxes paid.

Income statement
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and manufactured goods is recognised in the income statement if delivery and the transfer of risk to the purchaser have taken place.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is measured exclusive of VAT, taxes etc. charged on behalf of third parties and less any commissions and discounts in connection with sales.
Furthermore, revenue includes licence income and royalties from outlicensed products as well as up-front payments, milestone payments and other revenues in connection with research and development partnerships. These revenues are recognised in accordance with the agreements and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the ALK Group and these benefits can be measured reliably. Non-refundable payments that are not attributable to subsequent research and development activities are recognised when the related right is obtained, whereas payments attributable to subsequent research and development activities are recognised over the term of the activities. When combined contracts are entered into, the elements of the contracts are identified and assessed separately for accounting purposes.
Cost of sales The item comprises cost of sales and production costs incurred in generating the revenue for the year. Costs for raw materials, consumables, goods for resale, production staff and a proportion of production overheads, including maintenance and depreciation, amortisation and impairment of tangible assets and intangible assets used in production as well as operation, administration and management of factories are recognised in cost of sales and production costs. In addition, the costs and write-down to net realisable value of obsolete and slow-moving goods are recognised.
Research and development expenses The item comprises research and development expenses, including expenses incurred for wages and salaries, amortisation and other overheads as well as costs relating to research partnerships. Research expenses are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Due to the long development periods and significant uncertainties in relation to the development of new products, including risks regarding clinical trials and regulatory approvals, it is the assessment that most of the ALK Group's development expenses do not meet

the capitalisation criteria in IAS 38, Intangible Assets. Consequently, development expenses are generally recognised in the income statement when incurred. Development expenses relating to individual minor development projects running for short-term periods and subject to limited risk are capitalised under other intangible assets.
Sales and marketing expenses The item comprises selling and marketing expenses, including salaries and expenses relating to sales staff, advertising and exhibitions, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on the tangible assets and intangible assets used in the sales and marketing process as well as other indirect costs.
Administrative expenses The item comprises expenses incurred for management and administration, including expenses for administrative staff and management, office expenses and depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on the tangible assets and intangible assets used in administration.
Other operating income and other operating expenses Other operating income and other operating expenses comprise income and expenses of a secondary nature relative to the principal activities of the ALK Group.
Special items Special items include significant income and expenses of a special nature in terms of the ALK Group's revenue-generating operating activities, such as the cost of extensive restructuring, as well as gains or losses arising from disposals in this connection and termination benefits which have a material effect over a given period.

value corresponds to the carrying amount of the asset or liability, respectively.
Balance sheet
Goodwill On initial recognition, goodwill is measured and recognised as the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, as described under Business Combinations. In addition, goodwill on acquisition of investments in subsidiaries from minority interests is recognised.
On recognition of goodwill, the goodwill amount is allocated to those of the ALK Group's activities that generate separate cash flows (cash-generating units). The determination of cash-generating units is based on the ALK Group's management structure and internal financial management and reporting.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment at least once a year, as described below.
Intangible assets Acquired intellectual property rights in the form of patents, brands, licenses, software, customer base and similar rights are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Interest expenses on loans to finance the development of intangible assets are included in cost if they relate to the development period. Other borrowing costs are charged to the income statement.
The cost of software includes costs of planning work, including direct salaries.

These items are shown separately in order to give a more true and fair view of the ALK Group's operating profit.
Financial items Financial items comprise interest receivable and interest payable, the interest element of finance lease payments, realised and unrealised gains and losses on securities, cash and cash equivalents, liabilities and foreign currency transactions, mortgage amortisation premium/ allowance etc. and supplements/ allowances under the on-account tax scheme.
Interest income and expenses are accrued based on the principal and the effective rate of interest. The effective rate of interest is the discount rate to be used on discounting expected future payments in relation to the financial asset or the financial liability so that their present

Such acquired intellectual property rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the contract period, not exceeding 10 years. If the actual useful life is shorter than either the remaining life or the contract period, the asset is amortised over this shorter useful life. Acquired intellectual property rights are written down to their recoverable amount where this is lower than the carrying amount, as described below.
Individual minor development projects running for short-term periods and subject to limited risk are capitalised under other intangible assets as described under `Research and development expenses' and are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for

impairment at least once a year. To the extent that the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount, the assets are written down to this lower amount, as described below.

Tangible assets Land and buildings, plant and machinery and other fixtures and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Land is not depreciated.

Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition and any preparation costs incurred until the date when the asset is available for use.

The cost of assets held under finance leases is determined as the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of future minimum lease payments.

Interest expenses on loans to finance the manufacture of tangible assets are included in cost if they relate to the production period. Other borrowing costs are taken to the income statement.

The depreciation base is cost less the estimated residual value at the end of the useful life. The residual value, estimated at the acquisition date and reassessed annually, is determined as the amount the company expects to obtain for the asset less costs of disposal.

The cost of an asset is divided into smaller components that are depreciated separately if such components have different useful lives.

Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Buildings  Plant and machinery  Other fixtures and equipment 

25-50 years 5-10 years 5-10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed once a year. Tangible assets are written down to the recoverable amount, if lower, cf. below.

Impairment of tangible assets and intangible assets The carrying amounts of tangible assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed at the balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If such indications are found, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated to determine any need for an impairment writedown and, if so, the amount of the write-down. For intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives and goodwill, the recoverable amount is calculated annually, regardless of whether any indications of impairment have been found.

If the asset does not generate any cash flows independently of other assets, the recoverable amount is calculated for the smallest cashgenerating unit that includes the asset.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or the cash-generating unit, respectively. In determining the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money as well as risks that are specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit and which have not been taken into account in the estimated future cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount. For cash-generating units, the write-down is allocated in such a way that goodwill amounts are written down first, and any remaining need for write-down is allocated to other assets in the unit, although no individual assets are written down to a value lower than their fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment write-downs are recognised in the income statement. If write-downs are subsequently reversed as a result of changes in the assumptions on which the calculation of the recoverable amount is based, the carrying amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit is increased to the adjusted recoverable amount, not, however, exceeding the carrying amount that the asset or cash-generating unit would have had, had the write-down not been made. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed.
Other financial assets On initial recognition, securities and investments are measured at cost, corresponding to fair value. They are subsequently measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, and changes to the fair value are recognised under net financials in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are measured at cost determined under the FIFO method or net realisable value where this is lower.
Cost comprises raw materials, goods for resale, consumables and direct payroll costs as well as fixed and variable production overheads. Variable production overheads comprise indirect materials and payroll costs and are allocated based on predetermined costs of the goods actually produced. Fixed production overheads comprise maintenance of and depreciation on the machines, factory buildings and equipment used in the manufacturing process as well as the cost of factory

management and administration. Fixed production overheads are allocated based on the normal capacity of the production plant.
The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the expected selling price less completion costs and costs incurred in making the sale.
Receivables On initial recognition, receivables are measured at fair value, and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost. Receivables are written down for anticipated losses. An impairment account is used for this purpose.
Prepayments Prepayments are recognised as an asset and comprise incurred costs relating to subsequent financial years. Prepayments are measured at cost.
Dividend Dividend is recognised as a liability when adopted by the shareholders at the annual general meeting.
Treasury shares Acquisition and sales sums arising on the purchase and sale of treasury shares and dividends on treasury shares are recognised directly in retained earnings under equity.
Pension liabilities etc. The ALK Group has entered into pension agreements and similar agreements with some of the Group's employees.
In respect of defined contribution plans, the Group pays in fixed contributions to independent pension funds etc. The contributions are recognised in the income statement during the period in which the employee renders the related service. Payments due are recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
In respect of defined benefit plans, the Group is required to pay an agreed benefit in connection with the retirement of the employees covered by the plan, e.g. in the form of a fixed amount or a percentage of the salary at retirement.
For defined benefit plans, an annual actuarial assessment is made of the net present value of future benefits to which the employees have earned the right through their past service for the Group and which will have to be paid under the plan. The Projected Unit Credit Method is applied to determine net present value.
The net present value is calculated based on assumptions of the future developments of salary, interest, inflation, mortality and disability rates.

The net present value of pension liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet, after deduction of the fair value of any assets attached to the plan, as either plan assets or pension liabilities, depending on whether the net amount is an asset or a liability, as described below.
If the assumptions made with respect to discount factor, inflation, mortality and disability are changed, or if there is a discrepancy between the expected and realised return on plan assets, actuarial gains or losses occur. These gains and losses concerning previous financial years are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when, as a consequence of a past event during the financial year or previous years, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, and it is likely that settlement of the obligation will require an outflow of the company's financial resources.
Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the costs required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date. Provisions with an expected term of more than a year after the balance sheet date are measured at present value.
Mortgage debt Mortgage debt is recognised on the raising of a loan at cost, equalling fair value of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, mortgage debt is measured at amortised cost.
Lease liabilities Lease liabilities regarding assets held under finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet as liabilities and measured at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of future lease payments.
On subsequent recognition, lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the present value and the nominal value of lease payments is recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as a finance charge.
Lease payments regarding operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including bank and financial loans and trade payables, are on initial recognition measured at fair value. The liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Deferred income Deferred income comprises income received relating to subsequent financial years. Deferred income is measured at cost.
Other accounting information
Cash flow statement The cash flow statement of the Group is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.
The cash effect of acquisitions and divestments is shown separately under cash flows from investing activities. In the cash flow statement, cash flows concerning acquired companies are recognised from the date of acquisition, while cash flows concerning divested companies are recognised until the date of divestment.
Cash flows from operating activities are stated as net profit, adjusted for non-cash operating

items and changes in working capital, less the income tax paid during the year attributable to operating activities.
Cash flows from investing activities comprise payments in connection with acquisition and divestment of companies and financial assets as well as purchase, development, improvement and sale of intangible assets and tangible assets.
Cash flows from financing activities comprise changes to the parent company's share capital and related costs as well as the raising and repayment of loans, instalments on interestbearing debt, purchase of treasury shares, cash settlement of share options and payment of dividends.
Cash flows in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised in the cash flow statement using average exchange rates for the individual months if these are a reasonable approximation of the actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. If this is not the case, the actual exchange rates for the specific days in questions are used.

Cash and marketable securities comprise cash and short-term securities subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value less any overdraft facilities that are an integral part of the Group's cash management.
Segment reporting Based on the internal reporting used by the Board of Management to assess the results of operations and allocation of resources, the company has identified one operating segment `Allergy treatment', which is in accordance with the way the activities are organised and managed. In addition, the disclosures in the financial statements include a breakdown of revenue by product line and a geographical breakdown of revenue and non-current assets.
Definitions and ratios The key ratios have been calculated in accordance with `Recommendations and Financial Ratios 2015' issued by the Danish Association of Financial Analysts. Key ratios and definitions are shown on page 4 and 73, respectively.

2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

In the preparation of the annual report according to generally accepted accounting principles, Management is required to make certain estimates as many financial statement items cannot be reliably measured, but must be estimated. Such estimates comprise judgements made on the basis of the most recent information available at the reporting date. It may be necessary to change previous estimates as a result of changes to the assumptions on which the estimates were based or due to supplementary information, additional experience or subsequent events. Similarly, the value of assets and liabilities often depends on future events that are somewhat uncertain. In that connection, it is necessary to set out e.g. a course of events that reflects Management's assessment of the most probable course of events. In the financial statements for 2015, Management considers the following estimates and related judgements material to the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements.
Recoverable amount of goodwill The assessment of whether goodwill is impaired requires a determination of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which

the goodwill amounts have been allocated. The determination of the value in use requires estimates of the expected future cash flows of each cash-generating unit and a reasonable discount rate. At 31 December 2015, the carrying amount of goodwill is DKK 423 million (2014: DKK 415 million).
Indirect production overheads Indirect production overheads (IPO) are measured on the basis of the standard cost method. The basis of standard costs is reassessed regularly to ensure that standard costs are adjusted for changes in the utilisation of production capacity, production times and other relevant factors. Changes in the method of determining standard costs may significantly affect gross margin and the valuation of inventories. At 31 December 2015, the value of IPO is DKK 165 million (2014: DKK 120 million) on the inventories. The increase is mainly due to HDM-SLIT tablet inventory build up.
Tax Management is required to make an estimate in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The ALK Group recognises deferred tax assets if it is probable that they can be set

off against future taxable income. At 31 December 2015, the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is DKK 278 million (2014: DKK 140 million). The increase is a result of the transfer of the Jext business from the Swiss subsidary to the Danish Parent Company.
Provisions and contingent assets and liabilities Management assesses provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities as well as likely outcome of pending or probable lawsuits etc. on an on-going basic. The result depends on future events, which by nature are uncertain. In assessment of the likely outcome of lawsuits and tax disputes etc., management bases its assessment on established legal precedents and external legal advisors. In connection with restructuring, an assessment of the employee obligations and other liabilities occurring in connection with restructuring has been taken into account.
As at 31 December 2015, other provisions amount to DKK 28 million (2014: DKK 36 million). Other provisions mainly include provisions for restructuring.

Share option plans The ALK Group has established share option plans for the Board of Management and a number of key employees as a part of a retention programme.

Each share option entitles the holder to acquire one existing B share of DKK 10 nominal value in the company. The right to exercise the option is subject to the holder of the option not having resigned at the time of exercise. No other vesting conditions apply. The option can be exercised only during a period of four weeks after the publication of annual reports or interim financial statements. Share options are considered sufficiently covered by treasury shares.

5 Share-based payments (continued)
Conditional shares The ALK Group has established conditional share plans for the Board of Management and a number of key employees as a part of a retention programme. Conditional shares will be available three years after the date of grant, provided that ALK achieves the targets for vesting.

Restricted Stock Units In 2015, Board of Directors decided to grant Restricted Stock Units to all employees not included in the conditional shares plan. The programme granted 10 Restricted Stock Units to employees permanently employed at ALK as of 31 March 2015. A Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) is a right to receive one share or the value of one share in ALK upon vesting.

The programme will run for three years and vesting will be no later than 31 March 2018.

A total of 18,150 RSU's were granted in 2015. The costs of the programme were calculated based on a share price of DKK 746 and in total amounted to DKK 14 million, which are expensed over the vesting period.

As of 31 December, outstanding RSU's were 18,100 and are considered sufficiently covered by treasury shares.

¹In 2015, ALK decided to dissolve the adrenaline business unit in Switzerland and transfer all adrenaline activities into other areas and locations. As a consequence ALK recorded a one-off positive tax adjustment of DKK 74 million.
 Tax related to equity and other comprehensive income comprises DKK 9 million (2014: income DKK 28 million).
Tax related to the disposal of ALK's Dutch veterinarian business to a third party is included in current income tax with an amount of DKK 11 million.

10 Acquisitions of companies and operations
In June 2015, ALK took over the allergy immunotherapy activities of its former distributor in Turkey, Albio Allerji Ürünleri Ith. Ve Tic. Ltd. S¸ti. (Albio) with a view to facilitating growth in the Turkish market. The acquisition was made through ALK's Turkish subsidiary.
The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method.
The total purchase value of DKK 12 million was settled in cash.
Intangible assets in the form of customer lists and distribution rights represented DKK 7 million. After recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value, goodwill related to the acquisition has been calculated at DKK 5 million. Goodwill represents the value of the future growth potential and the value of acquired employees.
The purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration corresponding to a minor part of the purchase price covering the period until 2017.
Out of the ALK Group's revenue of DKK 2,569 million for the full year 2015, DKK 3 million is attributable to sales generated by the acquired operations after the acquisition date.
Had the activities in Albio been consolidated from 1 January 2015, the contribution to revenue and profit would have been DKK 5 million and less than DKK 1 million respectively.

Goodwill has been subject to an impairment test and submitted to the Audit Committee for subsequent approval by the Board of Directors. The impairment test performed in 2015 revealed no need for impairment of goodwill. Goodwill has been tested at an aggregated level. ALK Group is considered as one CGU as the individual companies and business units in ALK cannot be evaluated separately because the value-adding processes are generated across corporations and entities.

In the calculation of the value in use of cash-generating units, future free net cash flow is estimated based on Board of Directors-approved budget, ALK's Focus 2018 strategy and projections for subsequent years.

The budget and the strategy plan are based on specific future business initiatives for which the risks relating to key parameters have been assessed and recognised in estimated future free cash flows. The key parameters in the calculation of the value in use are revenue, earnings, working capital, capital expenditure, discount rate and the preconditions for the terminal value. Estimates are based on historical data and expectations on future changes in the markets and products. These expectations are based on a number of assumptions including expected product launches, volume forecasts and price information regarding ALK's partnerships for the SLIT-tablet programmes, ALK's sales projections from base business including SLITtablets and adrenaline auto-injectors as well as geographical expansions. The Focus 2018 strategy including the guiding principles of Grow, Innovate and Simplify is described on pages 14-17.

For financial years after the strategy period, the cash flows in the most recent period have been extrapolated adjusted for a growth factor of 1.5% during the terminal period.

The calculated value-in-use shows that future earnings and cash flows fully support the book value of total net assets, including goodwill. The discount rate used is 9% after tax, 11% before tax (2014: 9% after tax, 11% before tax).

Other intangible assets concern minor finished development projects and development projects in progress. The additions for the year include software development in progress DKK 32 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: DKK 21 million).

Deferred tax at 31 December 2015 consists of deferred tax assets of DKK 378 million (2014: DKK 168 million) and deferred tax liabilities of DKK 100 million (2014: DKK 28 million).
Deferred tax is recognised as tax assets in the balance sheet, since it is assessed to be probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated for the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
ALK-Abelló A/S is included in national joint taxation with Lundbeckfonden and its Danish subsidiaries.

Contingent liabilities The Board of Management assesses that the outcome of pending claims and other disputes will have no material impact on the ALK Group's financial position.

Liabilities relating to research and development projects and asset acquirements are estimated at DKK 12 million as at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: DKK 5 million).

Joint taxation scheme ALK-Abelló A/S is part of a Danish joint taxation scheme with Lundbeckfonden. As from the 2013 financial year, the company has partly a joint and several liability and partly a secondary liability with respect to income taxes etc. for the jointly-taxed companies, and as from 1 July 2012 it also has partly a joint and several liability and partly a secondary liability with respect to any obligations to withhold tax on interest, royalties and dividends for these companies. However, in both cases the secondary liability is capped at an amount equal to the share of the capital of the company directly or indirectly owned by the ultimate parent company. The total commitment for the joint taxation companies are included in the annual report of Lundbeckfonden.

Financial risk management policy As a result of its operations, its investments and its financing, the ALK Group is exposed to exchange and interest rate changes. For further information of exchange rate, interest rate and credit exposure see page 22-23. ALK-Abelló A/S manages the ALK Group's financial risks centrally and coordinates the ALK Group's cash management, including the raising of capital and investment of excess cash. The ALK Group complies with a policy, approved by the Board of Directors, to maintain a low risk profile, ensuring that the ALK Group is only exposed to exchange rate, interest rate and credit risk in connection with its commercial activities.
Exchange rate exposure The ALK Group mainly hedges its foreign exchange rate exposure through matching of payments received and paid in the same currency and through forward exchange rate contracts and currency options.
Interest rate exposure The ALK Group does not hedge its interest rate exposure, as this is not considered to be financially viable.
Credit exposure According to the Group's credit risk policy, all major customers and other business partners are credit rated regularly.

* Effective interest rate of fixed interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities.


An increase in interest rate by 1 percentage point on mortgage debt, bank loans and financial loans will reduce profit and loss and equity by less than DKK 1 million.

An increase in interest by 1 percentage point on cash and marketable securities would concequently increase profit and loss and equity approximatly DKK 6 million.

Credit exposure The ALK Group's primary credit exposure is related to trade receivables and cash and marketable securities. The ALK Group has no major exposure relating to any one customer or business partner. According to the ALK Group's policy for assuming credit exposure, all customers and business partners are credit rated regularly.

Embedded derivative financial instruments The ALK Group has made a systematic review of contracts that might contain terms that would make the contract or parts thereof a derivative financial instrument. The review did not lead to recognition of derivative financial instruments relating to the contracts.

1 Accounting policies
General
The financial statements of the parent company ALK-Abello A/S for the period 1 January ­ 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act for reporting class D enterprises.
The financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is also the functional currency of the company.
The accounting policies are as described below. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.
Differences relative to the Group's accounting policies The parent company's accounting policies for recognition and measurement are in accordance with the Group's accounting policies with the following exceptions:
Income statement
Results of investments in subsidiaries Dividends from investments in subsidiaries are recognised in the parent company's financial

statements when the right to the dividend finally vests, typically at the date of the company's approval in general meeting of the dividend of the company in question less any write-downs at the investments.
Balance sheet
Acquisition of activities from subsidiaries Acquisition of activities from subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. On initial recognition, goodwill is measured and recognised as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquisition-date amounts of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life, which is determined to be 10 years based on Management's expectations to the related business activities. Goodwill is written down to its recoverable amount if this is lower than its carrying amount.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost.

Where the recoverable amount of the investments is lower than cost, the investments are written down to this lower value.
In addition, cost is written down to the extent that dividends distributed exceed the accumulated earnings in the company since the acquisition date. In the event of indications of impairment, an impairment test is performed of investments in subsidiaries.
Other accounting information
Cash flow statement As allowed under section 86 (4) of the Danish Financial Statements Act, no cash flow statement is presented, as this is included in the consolidated cash flow statement.
Statement of changes in equity Pursuant to the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, entries recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements are recognised directly in the statement of change in equity in the parent company's financial statements except for entries concerning other financial assets.
