IV. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") endorsed by the European Union. As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements for issue, given the ongoing process of implementation of the IFRS in the European Union and the scope of the Group's business, as far as the accounting policies applied by the Group are concerned there are no differences between the IFRS which have come into force and the IFRS endorsed by the European Union. IFRS comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC").
V. Going concern assumption and comparability of accounts These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group would continue as a going concern for the 12 months after the end of the most recent reporting period, i.e. December 31st 2015. As at the date of signing these financial statements, the Parent's Management Board was aware of no facts or circumstances that would involve a threat to the Group's continuing as a going concern in the 12 months after the end of the reporting period, as a result of any planned or forced discontinuation or material downsizing of its existing operations. By the date of these consolidated financial statements for 2015, no events occurred which have not but should have been disclosed in the accounting books for the reporting period. In these financial statements no material events related to prior years are disclosed.
VI. Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the Company's financial statements and the financial statements of the entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.
a) Subsidiaries An entity is the Group's subsidiary if the Group has: - power over the entity, - exposure, or rights, to its variable returns, - the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of its own returns. The acquirer recognises goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b) below: a) the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred measured in accordance with IFRS 3, which generally requires acquisition-date fair value, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with IFRS 3, and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree. b) the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with IFRS 3. Following initial recognition, goodwill is recognised at cost less any cumulative impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Non-controlling interests are recognised at the fair value of net assets attributable to such interests. In subsequent periods, losses attributable to non-controlling interests are attributed to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests even if, as a consequence, the value of non-controlling interests turns negative. Subsidiaries sold during a financial year are consolidated from the beginning of the financial year to the date of disposal. Financial results of entities acquired during a year are recognised in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Income and expenses, receivables and payables, and unrealised gains arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent there is no evidence of impairment of the asset transferred in the transaction. The accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been changed whenever it was deemed necessary to align them with the accounting policies applied by the Group.
18

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements

b) Equity and transactions related to non-controlling shareholders
Interests held by non-controlling shareholders include interests in consolidated companies which are not owned by the Group. Equity held by non-controlling shareholders is determined as the value of net assets of the related entity which are attributable, as at the acquisition date, to shareholders from outside the group. The value is reduced/increased by increases/decreases in equity attributable to the value of interests held by non-controlling shareholders.

c) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the total vote in an entity's governing bodies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The Group's share in an associate's net profit (loss) is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, and the Group's share of the movements in the entity's other components of equity after the acquisition date is recognised under other components of equity. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted for the total changes as from the acquisition date.

d) Companies included in the consolidated financial statements

The following Group entities are included in these consolidated financial statements for the periods ended December 31st 2015 and December 31st 2014:

VII. Applied accounting policies, including methods of measurement of assets, equity and liabilities, income and expenses
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on a historical cost approach, except with respect to financial derivatives, which are measured at fair value.
Historical cost is determined on the basis of fair value of payment made for goods or services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions, irrespective of whether the price is directly observable or measured using another valuation technique. When measuring fair value, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date. The methods described above are used for the purpose of fair value measurement and/or disclosure of information in the Group's consolidated financial statements, except for share-based payments, which fall within the scope of IFRS 2, lease transactions, which fall within the scope of IAS 17, and except for measurements which show certain similarities with fair value, but are not fair value, such as net realisable value under IAS 2 or value in use under IAS 36.

Consolidated financial statements

These financial statements are presented in the zloty ("PLN"), and unless specified otherwise, all amounts are given in thousands of PLN.

Presentation of financial statements
Presentation of the statement of financial position
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as current and non-current.
In accordance with IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale are presented separately in the statement of financial position.
Presentation of the statement of comprehensive income
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, in the statement of comprehensive income expenses are presented by function.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for each period are determined by dividing net profit for the period by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period. The weighted average number of shares accounts for the dilutive effect of the issue of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Intangible assets
As intangible assets the Group recognises such assets which are identifiable (they can be separated or sold), are controlled by the entity and are highly probable to bring future economic benefits to the entity.
Intangible assets include mainly software and development expense, and are initially measured at cost, which comprises the purchase price of an asset, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.
The table below summarises the Group's accounting policies with respect to intangible assets:

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements

Depreciation is charged using the straight-line method by estimating the useful lives of given assets, which are as follows:

Buildings and structures

from 10 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

from 5 to 30 years

Vehicles

from 5 to 10 years

Other tangible assets

from 5 to 15 years

Non-current assets held under finance lease agreements are recognised in the statement of financial position and depreciated in accordance with the same policies as those applied to other non-current assets.

Non-current assets held under finance leases and liabilities corresponding to those assets were initially recognised at amounts equal to the discounted value of future lease payments. Lease payments made in the reporting period were charged to finance lease liabilities in an amount equal to the principal, and the excess (finance charge) was charged in full to finance costs of the period.

Any gains and losses arising on sale or liquidation of an asset are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group has adopted the rule that the residual value of tangible assets is always equal to "zero".

Tangible assets under construction
Tangible assets under construction include expenditure on property, plant and equipment which is not yet fit for use but it is highly probable that it will be completed. Tangible assets under construction are presented in the statement of financial position at cost less any impairment losses. Tangible assets under construction are not depreciated.

Investment property
The Group classifies as investment property all property which is considered a source of income (earns rentals) and/or is held for capital appreciation.
Investment property is carried at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of the investment property, using the straight-line method. Land is not depreciated.

Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets include equity interests in related entities, assets at fair value through profit or loss, hedging derivatives, loans and receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities include borrowings and other debt instruments, other types of financing, overdraft facilities, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, hedging derivatives, trade payables, liabilities to suppliers of property, plant and equipment, and lease liabilities.
Except for investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, which are carried at cost in accordance with IAS 27 and IAS 28, financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Recognition and measurement of financial assets
Upon initial recognition, financial assets are recognised at fair value, which in the case of investments not measured at fair value through profit or loss is increased by transaction costs directly attributable to such assets.
Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at amounts initially invoiced, less any impairment losses on doubtful receivables. Impairment losses on receivables are estimated when the collection of the full amount of a receivable is no longer probable.

21

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
If the effect of the time value of money is material, the value of a receivable is determined by discounting the projected future cash flows to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the current market estimates of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the amount of receivables increases to reflect the passage of time. The increase is recognised as finance income. Other receivables include in particular prepayments made in connection with planned purchases of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held mainly in connection with the need to meet the Group's current demand for cash rather than for investment or any other purposes. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts, cash in hand, as well as all liquid instruments which may immediately be converted into cash of known amount and in the case of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. Recognition and measurement of financial liabilities
Liabilities under borrowings Liabilities under borrowings and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability increase the carrying amount of the liability, because upon initial recognition the liability is recognised at the fair value of amounts paid or received in exchange for the liability. Thereafter, such costs are amortised throughout the term of the liability, using the effective interest rate method. Hedge accounting There are three types of hedging relationships:
a) a fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or highly probable future liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the statement of comprehensive income;
b) a cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability and (ii) could affect the statement of comprehensive income;
c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation as defined in IAS 21. A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if, and only if, all of the following conditions are met:
a) At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. That documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
b) The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistently with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship.
c) For cash flow hedges, a forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.
d) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, i.e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging instrument, can be reliably measured.
e) The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
22

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
Inventories Inventories are measured at cost, using the weighted average cost formula. Any downward adjustment of the value of inventories to the net selling price is made through recognition of write-downs. Furthermore, inventories that are slow-moving or which have become obsolete or whose usability has become in any way limited are revalued as at the end of each financial year. If the circumstances leading to a decrease in the value of inventories cease to apply, the write-down is reversed. Write-downs of inventories and stocktaking discrepancies are charged to cost of sales.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and their tax values, as well as for any unused tax loss carry-forwards and unused tax credits. Deferred tax liabilities are substantially recognised in relation to all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised in relation to all deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that in the foreseeable future taxable income will be generated which will enable the deductible temporary differences to be offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise in relation to goodwill or on the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither tax nor accounting profit. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised if the temporary differences arise on initial recognition of goodwill. A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets attributable to deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are recognised only to the extent it is probable that taxable income will be generated which will enable the tax assets to be utilised and to the extent it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or asset realised. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the expenditures required to settle a provision are expected to be reimbursed, for instance under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received. The cost related to a given provision is disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income net of any recoveries. If the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision is determined by discounting the projected future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting the current market estimates of the time value of money, as well as any risk associated with a given obligation. Where discounting is used, the amount of a provision increases to reflect the passage of time. The increase is recognised as finance cost. The estimates of outcome and financial effect are determined by the judgement of the management, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
The Group recognises the following provisions: · provision for warranty repairs ­ on the basis of the historical cost of warranty repairs; · provision for accrued holiday entitlements ­ in an amount equivalent to the number of days of accrued unused holidays multiplied by average gross daily pay; · provision for employee benefits ­ bonus payments, salaries and wages; · provision for probable costs related to the current financial year which will only be invoiced in the following year (accrued expenses). Depending on the type of accrued expenses, they are charged to cost of sales, distribution costs or administrative expenses; · provision for a defined benefit plan. Fixed contributions are paid to a separate entity (a fund), as a consequence of which the actuarial risk (that benefits will be lower than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet the expected benefits) are borne by the Group.
Assumptions underlying the estimates and the provision amounts are reviewed as at the end of each reporting period.
Accruals and deferred income In order to ensure the matching of revenues with related expenses, expenses relating to future periods and deferred income are posted under liabilities of a given reporting period.
Accrued expenses The Group recognises accrued expenses at probable values of current-period liabilities arising in particular under:
· services provided to the Company by its trading partners, where the liability can be reliably estimated, · up to the estimated contract revenue, advances received under construction contracts reduce the receivables
under settlement of long-term contracts. Deferred and accrued income Deferred/accrued income includes primarily government grants intended to finance assets and revenue, as well as any excess of estimated revenue related to the stage of completion of a long-term contract, in accordance with IAS 11, over advances received. Government grants are disclosed in the statement of financial position at the amount of funds received and then recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants are not credited directly to equity. Accruals and deferrals settled over a period longer than 12 months as from the end of the reporting period are classified as non-current accruals and deferrals, whereas those settled over a period of 12 months or shorter are classified as current accruals and deferrals.
Functional currency and presentation currency a) Functional currency and presentation currency Items of the financial statements are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates ("functional currency"). The financial statements are presented in the Polish zloty (PLN), which is the functional currency and the presentation currency of the Group. b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of these transactions, as well as from changes in the carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Material judgements and estimates
In view of the fact that many items presented in the consolidated financial statements cannot be measured accurately, certain estimates need to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Management Board reviews such estimates taking into account the changes in the factors on which such estimates were based, new information and past experience. Therefore, the estimates made as at December 31st 2014 may change in the future.
Depreciation/amortisation charges
Depreciation/amortisation charges are determined based on the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The Group reviews the useful lives of its assets annually, on the basis of current estimates.
Depreciation/amortisation charges for assets used under finance lease agreements
Depreciation/amortisation charges for items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets used under finance lease agreements are determined based on their expected useful lives, which is consistent with depreciation policy for assets that are owned. Useful lives equal to agreement term are not applied. The Group assumes that assets used under lease agreements must be purchased.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of all unused tax losses to be deducted in the future to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available which will enable these losses to be utilised.
Provision for accrued holidays
Provision for accrued holidays is determined based on the number of days of accrued unused holidays as at the end of the reporting period.
Provision for old-age and disability retirement benefits
Disability severance payments and retirement bonuses are paid to employees of the Group's subsidiaries operating under Polish law in accordance with the provisions of Art. 92 of the Polish Labour Code, whereas at foreign companies such payments or bonuses are paid in accordance with the local labour laws. Actuarial valuation of long- and short-term benefits is performed at the end of each financial year.
Provision for warranty repairs
Provision for warranty repairs is calculated on the basis of the historical costs of manufacturing of the equipment sold and of the warranty repairs made in the previous years.
Long-term contracts
To account for long-term contracts, the Group applies the provisions of IAS 11 Construction Contracts. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, the percentage of completion method is used. The percentage of completion is determined by reference to costs incurred to date in comparison with total contract costs determined in accordance with the Group's best estimate.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group makes estimates regarding the outcome of each contract. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss.
The amount of such a loss is determined irrespective of: whether or not work has commenced on the contract, the stage of completion of contract activity, or the amount of profits expected to arise on other contracts which are not treated as single construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11:9.
The Group applies the above rules to settle commercial contracts related to the Group's principal operating activities whose performance terms exceed three months and whose total value is material from the point of view of reliability of the financial statements (revenue, expenses, and the financial result). The Company accrues only documented revenue, i.e. revenue which is guaranteed under the original contract, adjusted to account for any subsequent amendments to the original contract (annexes). Any changes of the contract revenue are taken into account if it is certain (i.e. a contract or annexes to a contract have been signed) or at least highly probable (i.e. annexes to a contract or preliminary contracts have been initialled) that the client will accept the amendments and the revenue amounts provided for in the amendments, and such revenue can be reliably measured.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined by reference to the contract costs actually incurred in the reporting period and documented by appropriate accounting evidence, and the costs of trading partners not yet invoiced.

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
The revenue as at the end of the reporting period is determined based on the percentage of completion of the contract, net of any revenue which affected the financial result in previous reporting periods. Estimated contract revenue attributable to the given reporting period is recognised as revenue from sale of finished goods for the period, and disclosed under assets in the statement of financial position as receivables under settlement of long-term contracts. Any excess of advances received under a contract over the estimated revenue attributable to a given reporting period is recognised under liabilities as prepaid deliveries. Up to the amount of the estimated contract revenue, advances reduce the receivables under settlement of long-term contracts. Any excess of invoiced revenue is recognised as deferred income.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value as at the relevant contract date, and subsequently they are remeasured at fair value as at the end of each reporting period. Any resultant gains or losses are recognised directly in profit or loss, unless a given instrument is used as a hedge, in which case the time of recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship.
Subjective judgement Where a given transaction does not fall within the scope of any standard or interpretation, the Management Board relies on its subjective judgement to determine and apply accounting policies which will ensure that the financial statements contain only relevant and reliable information. Within the period covered by these financial statements, no transactions were identified whose recognition would require the application of the Management Board's subjective judgement as defined above.
IX. Changes in accounting policies Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards and related interpretations issued in the form of the European Commission's regulations.
Status of EU endorsement of the Standards Currently, the EU-approved IFRS do not differ significantly from the regulations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), with the exception of the following interpretations, which have not yet been adopted as at the date of issue of these financial statements:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018
In its original version of 2009, IFRS 9 introduced new requirements concerning classification and measurement of financial assets. In October 2010, the standard was modified to include requirements concerning classification and measurement of financial liabilities and rules of derecognition. In November 2014, IFRS 9 was further extended to include new requirements concerning hedge accounting. Another revision of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It introduced a new impairment model and limited changes to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets (new classification of certain basic debt instruments: fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)).
Key requirements under IFRS 9:
· All financial assets to which IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement currently applies must be measured at amortised cost or at fair value. In particular, investments in debt instruments held based on a business model (the objective of which is to collect the contractual cash flows) which generate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are generally measured at amortised cost at the end of each accounting period. Debt instruments held based on a business model which envisages collection of contractual cash flows with the possibility to sell the instrument which generate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, must be measured at FVTOCI. All other debt and equity instruments are measured at fair value at the end of each accounting period. Moreover, in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity can make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes to the fair value of an equity investment (not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income recognised in profit or loss.
26

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
· With respect to financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, IFRS 9 requires that any changes in the fair value of a financial liability attributable to changes in credit risk of the liability be presented in other comprehensive income, unless the presentation of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in the fair value attributable to changes in credit risk of the liability which are presented in other comprehensive income may not be subsequently transferred to profit or loss. In accordance with IAS 39, the entire amount of the change of fair value of a financial liability designated for measurement at fair value through profit or loss must be recognised in profit or loss.
· With respect to impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 requires the application of the expected loss impairment model instead of the incurred loss impairment model previously required under IAS 39. The expected loss impairment model requires an entity to account for expected credit losses and their changes as at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk following its initial recognition. In other words, a credit event does not need to occur before credit losses can be recognised.
· The new requirements concerning hedge accounting retain the three types of hedge accounting defined in IAS 39. IFRS 9 is more flexible with respect to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting; in particular, it broadens the range of instruments eligible as hedges and allows designation of risk components in the case of non-financial items. Effectiveness tests were replaced by the requirement of existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Retrospective evaluation of the hedge effectiveness is no longer required. Also, additional requirements were introduced concerning disclosure of information on risk management by entities.
Preliminary analysis of the impact of IFRS 9 on the applied accounting principles revealed that for the Group a significant change will be related to replacing the existing models of classification and measurement under IAS 39 with a one model including only two classification categories: amortized cost and fair value. Classification under IFRS 9 is based on the business model used for managing financial assets. In addition, the standard introduces a new model of hedge accounting that requires extensive disclosures regarding risk management. Due to the large scope of change, evaluation of the impact of IFRS 9 on the separate financial statements is subject to further analysis
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2018
IFRS 15, which provides a single model to account for revenues under contracts with customers, was issued in May 2014. IFRS 15 is mandatory to all reporting entities. When it comes into effect, IFRS 15 will replace the revenue recognition guidance contained in IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related Interpretations.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework:
· Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. · Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. · Step 3: Determine the transaction price. · Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. · Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
In accordance with IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue when it has satisfied its performance obligation, i.e. when control over the goods or services which are the subject of this obligation has been transferred. IFRS 15 also contains far more restrictive guidance concerning specific aspects of revenue recognition, and requires disclosure of a broad range of information.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of these amendments will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Preliminary analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 on the applied accounting principles revealed that it changes the way the settlement of contracts with customers, especially when under one contract the services are provided and goods are supplied, as in the case of the Group may be important in the Sales segment. It is expected that the new guidelines of IFRS 15 may result in the need to change systems, whereas before the entry into force of the standard Group plans to analyse
27

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
contracts with customers in five steps - from the identification of the contract (or groups of contracts), by indicating the individual commitments and set prices, allocate them individual commitments and recognition of revenue. The new standard requires disclosure of a much larger amount of information about sales and revenues in the financial statements. Due to the large scope of change evaluation of the impact of IFRS 15 on the separate financial statements is subject to further analysis.
IFRS 16 "Lease" - effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later
According to IFRS 16, the lessee recognizes the right to use the asset and the lease obligation. The right to use the asset is treated like any other non-financial assets and depreciated accordingly. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable during the lease discounted at the interest contained in the lease, if the determination is not difficult. If it is not easily to determine this rate, the lessee uses the marginal rate. With regard to the classification of leases with lessors, it is performed as well as in accordance with IAS 17 - ie. as operating leases or finance. At the lessor's lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the assets concerned. Otherwise, the lease is classified as an operating lease. In the financial leasing lessor recognizes finance income over the lease term, based on a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment. Lessor operating lease payments in income linearly or other systematic way, if it better reflects the pattern receive the benefits from the use of assets.
Preliminary analysis of the impact of IFRS 16 on the applied accounting principles revealed that for the Group a significant change will be related to the need of recognition in the financial assets and lease obligations for leases currently classified as operating leases and the presentation of assets subject to finance leases, which now they recognized as part of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets. The Group plans to analyse all lease agreements to identify those that will require recognition of assets and liabilities in the financial statements or changes in the presentation. Due to the distant date of entry into force of IFRS 16, which has not yet been approved by the EU, on the date of approval for publication of the financial statements the Group has not yet analysed the impact of planned changes on the separate financial statements. Such an analysis will be carried out at a later date.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements ­ Disclosure Initiative ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016
The purpose of the amendments to IAS 1 is to encourage entities to use professional judgement in determining what information is required to be disclosed in an entity's financial statements. For instance, the amendments clarify that materiality considerations apply to all parts of the financial statements and that inclusion of immaterial information may obscure financial statements. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that entities should use professional judgement to determine where and in what order the disclosures should be presented in the financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ­ Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016
The purpose of the amendments is to remove the inconsistencies between the requirements contained in IAS 28 and those imposed under IFRS 10, and to clarify that the recognition of any gain or loss arising from a transaction between an investor and its associate or joint venture depends on whether the assets sold or contributed constitute a business.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of the above amendments will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures ­ Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
These minor amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 provide clarification with respect to accounting for investment entities. The amendments also introduce some exceptions in this respect, applicable in specific circumstances.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of these amendments will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements, because neither the parent nor its higher-tier parent or any of their subsidiaries, jointly-controlled entities or associates are investment entities.
IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2012-2014 ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016
28

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
The IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2012-2014 comprises a number of minor amendments to IFRS, which are briefly discussed below.
The amendments to IFRS 5 provide specific guidelines for reclassification of an asset (or a disposal group) from assets held for sale to assets held for distribution to owners (or vice versa), or where assets cease to be classified as held for distribution. The amendments stipulate that:
· such reclassification will not be deemed a change to the plan of sale or distribution to owners, and therefore the requirements concerning classification, presentation and valuation applicable to the new disposal method should be complied with; · assets which no longer meet the criteria to be classified as assets held for distribution to owners (and which do not meet the criteria for assets held for sale) should be treated in the same manner as assets which have ceased to be classified as assets held for sale.
The amendments apply prospectively.
Amendments to IFRS 7 add additional guidance to clarify whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement in a transferred asset for the purpose of determining the disclosures required with respect to transferred assets. Paragraph 42C (c) of IFRS 7 provides that the transfer of contractual obligations does not in itself imply a continuing involvement for the purpose of the transfer disclosure requirements.
The amendments to IFRS 7 have been introduced to eliminate doubts regarding inclusion of required disclosures on offsetting financial assets and liabilities (introduced in December 2011 and effective for periods beginning on or after January 1st 2014) in condensed interim financial statements and ­ if such inclusion is required ­ regarding whether the requirement applies to all such financial statements prepared after January 1st 2014 on only to those prepared in the first year after that date.
Amendments to IAS 19 clarify that in determining the discount rate for post-employment benefits an entity should use high quality corporate bonds issued in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid. The amendments will help assess the depth of the market for such bonds at a the currency level.
Amendments to IAS 34 clarify the requirements concerning disclosures which are required under IAS 34 and are presented elsewhere in the interim financial report, but not in the interim financial statements. According to the improvements, such information will be included in the interim financial statements by reference to another part of the interim report available to users on the same terms and at the same time as the interim financial statements.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of the above improvements will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
At the same time, the regulations endorsed by the EU still do not include hedge accounting of portfolios of financial assets and liabilities; relevant rules have not been adopted for use in the EU.
According to the entity's estimates, the application of hedge accounting of portfolios of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement would have no material effect on the financial statements, if the relevant rules had been adopted for use in the EU as at the reporting date.
First-time adoption of standards
The following standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed for use in the EU apply to the Group for the first time in the consolidated financial statements for 2015:
IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2011-2013
The IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2011-2013 comprises a number of minor amendments to IFRS, which are briefly discussed below.
29

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
The Basis for Conclusions of IFRS 1 was modified to clarify that an entity, in its first IFRS financial statements, may (though it is under no obligation to) apply early a new IFRS that is not yet mandatorily effective, provided that the new IFRS permits early application. If an entity opts for such early application, it has to apply the new IFRS retrospectively to all presented periods, unless an exemption is available under IFRS 1 or an exception from that rule applies.
In IFRS 3 the chapter devoted to scope was modified and clarification was provided that IFRS 3 excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint arrangement in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself.
Amendments to IFRS 13 included modification of the scope of the portfolio exception (an exception for measuring the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis); the modifications clarified that the portfolio exception includes all contracts accounted for within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, regardless of whether they meet the definition of financial assets or financial liabilities provided in IAS 32.
IAS 40 was amended to clarify that IAS 40 and IFRS 3 Business Combinations are not mutually exclusive and that the separate application of both standards may be required. Therefore, an entity purchasing investment property must determine whether the property meets the definition of both an investment property as defined in IAS 40 and that of a business combination as defined in IFRS 3.
IFRIC 21 Levies
IFRIC 21 is the interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. One of the criteria for the recognition of a liability under IAS 37 is the requirement for a present obligation to have arisen as a result of a past event (obligating event). The interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a public levy is an activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with applicable legislation.
The Group's Management Board believes that the above changes and the new interpretation have no significant effect on the amounts disclosed in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Early application of standards and interpretations
When preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group's Management Board decided that none of the standards will be applied early.
Standards published and endorsed by the EU but not yet effective
When authorising these financial statements, the Group had not applied the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which were issued and endorsed for use in the EU but not yet effective:
Amendments to various standards introduced as part of the IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2010-2012, endorsed by the EU on December 17th 2014 ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1st 2015
The IFRS Annual Improvements cycle 2010-2012 comprises a number of minor amendments to IFRS, which are briefly discussed below.
The amendments to IFRS 2 (i) amend the definition of `vesting condition' and `market condition' and (ii) add definitions for `performance condition' and `service condition' (which were previously part of the definition of `vesting condition').
Amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability must be measured at fair value at each reporting date, irrespective of whether such consideration has the form of a financial instrument that falls within the scope of IFRS 9 or IAS 39, or the form of a non-financial asset/liability. All fair value changes (other than fair value adjustments made as part of periodic valuation) must be taken to profit or loss.
Amendments to IFRS 8 (i) require an entity to disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments, including to provide a description of the aggregated operating segments and of the economic indicators taken into account when making the decision whether the given segments have similar economic characteristics, and (ii) clarify that an entity shall only provide reconciliations of the total of the reportable segments' assets to the entity's assets if the segment assets are regularly reported to the chief operating decision maker.
30

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
Amendments to the Basis of Conclusions of IFRS 13 clarify that issuing IFRS 13 and amending (accordingly) IFRS 9 and IAS 39 did not remove the ability to measure short-term receivables and payables with no stated interest rate at their invoice amounts without discounting if the effect of not discounting is immaterial. As no effective date was specified for the above amendments, it is assumed that they apply immediately after publication.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 eliminate the inconsistencies in accounting for accumulated depreciation or amortisation when an item of property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is revalued. The modified standards clarify that when an asset is revalued, the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset, and the accumulated amortisation or depreciation is equal to the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount net of accumulated impairment. Amendments to IAS 24 clarify that a management entity providing key management personnel services to the reporting entity is a related party of the reporting entity. Therefore, the reporting entity must disclose the amounts paid or payable to the management entity for providing key management personnel services as related party transactions. The components of such amounts are not required to be disclosed, though.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of the above improvements will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016)
The amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 introduce the definition of bearer plants and bring biological assets that meet this definition into the scope of IAS 16 so that they are accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment. Produce growing on bearer plants continues to be accounted for under IAS 41.
Given that the Group is not engaged in agricultural activities, the Management Board does not anticipate that application of the revised IAS 16 and IAS 41 will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets ­ explanations concerning acceptable methods of accounting for depreciation and amortisation (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016)
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortisation of an intangible asset. This presumption can only be rebutted in the following two limited circumstances: a) when the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, or b) when it can be demonstrated that revenue and consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016. Currently, the Group uses the straight-line method to depreciate/amortise its property, plant and equipment/intangible assets. The Management Board believes that the straight-line method is the most appropriate one to reflect the consumption of economic benefits inherent in the respective assets. Accordingly, the Management Board does not anticipate that application of the revised IAS 16 and IAS 38 will have a significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 19 `Employee Benefits ­ Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions', endorsed by the EU on December 17th 2014 ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1st 2015
The amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service.
Contributions not linked to the number of years in service may either be recognised as a reduction of service cost in a given period of service or attributed to periods of service using the projected unit credit method. Contributions linked to the number of years in service must be attributed to periods of service.
In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of the revised IAS 19 will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
31

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations ­ effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016 The amendments to IFRS 11 contain guidance on accounting for the acquisition of interests in joint operations in circumstances in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Specifically, the amendments state that the relevant principles on accounting for business combinations in IFRS 3 and other standards (e.g. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets regarding impairment testing of a cash-generating unit to which goodwill on acquisition of a joint operation has been allocated) must be applied. The same requirements should be applied to the formation of a joint operation if and only if an existing business is contributed to the joint operation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation. An entity is also required to disclose the relevant information required by IFRS 3 and other standards for business combinations. Amendments to IFRS 11 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2016. In the opinion of the Company's Management Board, application of the above amendments will have no significant effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Group did not opt for early application of the above standards, amendments, and interpretations. The Group estimates that the above standards, interpretations and amendments to standards would not have had a material effect on the financial statements if they had been applied by the Group as at the reporting date. Voluntary changes in accounting policies When preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group did not make any voluntary changes to the accounting policies applied in previous periods.

Note 2. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group's core business consists in manufacture of five key groups of products: vacuum furnaces, aluminium heat exchanger brazing systems, aluminium heat treatment systems and metallurgy equipment used for melting and vacuum casting of metals and specialty alloys. Also, in accordance with the Company's management accounts, a separate aftersales segment has been established. The SECO/WARWICK Group's operations are divided into five core business segments corresponding to the product groups:
Vacuum furnaces (Vacuum)
Vacuum furnaces have multiple applications in a number of industries, including machine tool, aviation, power, electrical engineering, medical equipment, automotive and specialised industries. Vacuum furnaces may be used in a wide variety of processes, such as heat treatment of steel and alloys, brazing, sintering, and degassing.
Melting furnaces
The metallurgy applications of the vacuum melting furnaces include alloying, melting and purifying specialty metals, including reactive metals (e.g. titanium, zirconium) and heat-resistant metals (e.g. tantalum). Due to their physical properties, specialty metals may only be treated with the use of technologically advanced solutions under high vacuum conditions.
The different types of melting furnaces include melting and holding furnaces used for the manufacture of precision castings (such as components of jet engines, power turbines and medical implants).
Melting furnaces may also be used as an element of the globally-unique processes involving disposal of hazardous waste (such as nuclear by-products).
Aluminium heat exchanger brazing systems (CAB)
The CAB systems are used primarily in the automotive industry for brazing heat exchangers mounted in passenger cars and trucks (charge air coolers, air conditioning evaporators and condensers, oil coolers, etc.). Outside the automotive industry, CAB processes are used in the manufacture of IC radiators, steam condensers for CHP plants, exhaust gas heat exchangers for power generators, etc.
Thermal
Atmosphere furnaces are widely used in the process of thermal and thermochemical treatment of steel and metals in protective atmospheres for improved hardness. Atmosphere furnaces designed for thermochemical treatment are employed in the gas carburising, gas nitriding and other processes. Such furnaces are used chiefly by the automotive and metal industries, including for the manufacturing of anti-friction bearings, as well as for use in commercial hardening plants and specialty industries.

34

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements
Aluminium heat treatment systems (Aluminium Process) The Aluminium Process solutions offered by the Group are used in the production of aluminium sheet for the automotive and aviation industries, as well as for the manufacturing of packaging foil for multiple applications. In addition, the Aluminium Process systems are used to heat treat aluminium castings. Aftersales The Aftersales Segment covers the conversion, modernisation and modification of customer-owned equipment, including the equipment manufactured by third parties. This segment also includes sale of spare parts and all aftersales services. Financial data for the segments includes only segment revenue, expenses and segment's profit or loss. It is impracticable for the Group to allocate assets to the particular segments as its plant and equipment (including buildings and structures) is shared by all the segments. Other Reportable geographical segments, delineated based on the geographical location of the respective sales markets, are as follows:
o the EU market, o Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian markets, o the US market, o the Asian market, o other countries. Financial data for the segments includes only segment revenue, expenses and segment's profit or loss. It is impracticable for the Group to allocate assets to the particular segments as its plant and equipment (including buildings and structures) is shared by all the segments.

Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2014

Note 15. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-ACCOUNTED ASSOCIATES
OOO SCT
The Group holds 50% of ordinary shares in OOO SCT (a company operating under Russian law), representing 50% of the total vote at the company's general meeting. The Russian shareholder holds the other 50% of the total vote.
OOO SCT was established by the SECO/WARWICK Group and the Russian shareholder on August 17th 2012. The company provides metal heat treatment services in Russia.

Dec 31 2014
191 111 4,534 227 723 267 -967 50%

The Parent does not control OOO SCT within the meaning of IFRS 3, as it has no power to govern its financial and operating policies. Pawel Wyrzykowski (President of the Parent's Management Board) and Jaroslaw Talerzak (VicePresident of the Parent's Management Board) sit on the four-member Board of Directors of OOO SCT but do not perform any day-to-day operational duties for OOO SCT. The current operational responsibilities have been transferred to the Management Board of the company OOO SCT. Given the above, and considering the fact that SECO/WARWICK holds more than 20% and less than 50% of ordinary shares and a corresponding interest in the net assets of the acquired company, the Management Board of the Parent believes that SECO/WARWICK has `significant influence' over the acquiree. Accordingly, the investment in OOO SCT is measured with the equity method in accordance with IAS 28.

Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2014

As prescribed by IAS 12.44, the Group recognises deferred tax for temporary differences arising from investments in associates only to the extent it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Parent's Management Board considers the investment in OOO SCT to be a long-term investment (currently there are no plans to sell the shares). In view of that and in accordance with IAS 12.44, no deferred tax was recognised in respect of the temporary differences arising from investments in associates.

Disclosures of derivative financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting
In 2015, SECO/WARWICK EUROPE Sp. z o.o. used currency forwards to hedge an average of 55% of its export cash flows denominated in EUR, 52% of its cash flows denominated in USD, and up to 90% of its cash flows denominated in GBP. The purpose is to hedge the budgeted exchange rates for contracts. Any changes in the value of EUR-, USD-, GBP-, or RUB-denominated cash flows are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting is applied if the criteria provided for in IAS 39:88 are met.
The balance-sheet valuation of derivative instruments is recognised in equity. If a transaction which has been hedged with a currency forward affects profit or loss, the valuation previously recognised in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.
Given that transactions in derivative instruments are entered into for the purposes of concluded long-term contracts (accounted for based on the stage of completion measured by reference to contract costs incurred), the Group assumed that the transactions affect profit or loss in proportion to the percentage of completion of a given contract.
The Group further assumed that the valuations of derivative instruments as at the reporting date provided by partner banks reliably reflect the fair value of its currency forwards, and so this value was disclosed in its accounting records.
The effectiveness of transactions is assessed by comparing the maturity dates and nominal values of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.

Social assets and liabilities of the Company Social Benefits Fund (Polish companies)
The Act on Company Social Benefits Fund of March 4th 1994 (as amended) stipulates that an employer should set up a Company Social Benefits Fund if it has more than 20 full-time employees. The Company has set up such a Fund and makes periodic contributions to the Fund in the amount of the basic contribution / contribution agreed upon with the trade unions. Additionally, the Fund holds property, plant and equipment. The Fund is used to subsidise the Company's social activity, loans advanced to the employees and other social expenses.
The Group set off the Fund's assets against its liabilities towards the Fund, as the Fund's assets do not represent a separate asset category.

Note 35. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective behind the Group's capital management is to maintain good credit rating and safe capital ratios, in order to support the Group's operations and enhance its shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and modifies it in response to changes in the economic environment. To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Company may make changes regarding dividend distributions, return capital to the shareholders or issue new shares. During the year ended December 31st 2015, no changes were made to capital management objectives, policies and processes.
In monitoring its capital, the Group uses the leverage ratio calculated as net debt divided by total equity plus net debt. The Group's net debt includes interest-bearing borrowings and other debt instruments, trade payables and other liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes convertible preference shares and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, less capital reserve from unrealised net gains.

The gearing ratio at end of the year was as follows:
Debt Cash and cash equivalents Net debt Equity Net debt to equity

Dec 31 2015 PLN'000 71,776 -58,054 13,722 176,030 7.80%

Dec 31 2014 PLN'000 47,075 -46,702 373 249,305 0.15%

The low net debt to equity ratio is a result of the Management Board's conservative approach to debt. Accumulated cash is used to fund the Group's operating activities.

Note 36. TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
The Parent carried out impairment tests on goodwill in subsidiaries Seco/Warwick Allied Pvt. Ltd., Seco/Warwick Corp., Retech Systems LLC and SECO/WARWICK Services. In the course of the tests, impairment of goodwill was identified in two subsidiaries. The recoverable amounts attributable to individual cash-generating units were determined based on their calculated value in use.
Cash-generating unit
In each case, value in use was calculated based on the 2016 budget and projections for the following four years. The projections reflect the management's business experience and an analysis of third-party information. The table below presents the key assumptions concerning the discount rate and the estimated growth rate after the period of detailed projections:

SECO/WARWICK Allied ­ the low number of new orders resulted in adopting a more conservative approach to the Company's forecasts. Political changes that followed the 2014 elections inhibited the capital investment decision-making process. The Company's Management Board expects a market recovery in 2016 and beyond.
SECO/WARWICK Brasil ­ forecasts are reduced due to political and macroeconomic factors. New orders fell to a low level again as a result of potential customers (including from the automotive industry) freezing a large number of capital projects. The Management Board sees no signs of a significant improvement in this market in the near term.
Other important assumptions for the calculation of the value in use are as follows:
Estimates of the value in use of a cash-generating unit are sensitive to changes of the following variables:
· free cash flows;
· discount rates;
· market share in the projection period.
Free cash flows are estimated based on historical data concerning individual cash-generating units and forecast operating profit, depreciation and amortisation, capital expenditure, changes in non-cash current assets and non-financial liabilities.
The discount rate applied in the impairment tests, the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted in each case (ie. For each test of the shares and the "goodwill") of premiums and discounts on account of the risks specific to a particular test asset (as well as the risk country and for differences in expected inflation in the countries in which they operate individual companies of the Group Seco / Warwick).
Growth rates are estimated based on the published findings of industry research.
Assumptions regarding the market are material because ­ in addition to using industry data to determine the growth rate ­ the management assesses how the assets and financial standing of individual cash-generating units may change over the budget period relative to their peers. The management expects the market share to remain stable over the projection period.

Note 37. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICY In the course of its operating and financing activities, the SECO/WARWICK Group is exposed to risks arising mainly in connection with the financial instruments held. Those risks may be broadly defined as market risk, comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The objective behind the Group's financial risk management is to mitigate any adverse movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, stabilise cash flows and ensure an adequate level of liquidity and financial flexibility. The rules of financial risk management within the Group are determined by the Parent's Management Board. As part of the risk management process, an expert management accounting system has been developed and implemented. The key risk parameters at the level of operating and financing activities are monitored through monthly reports for the Group companies.

37.1 Currency risk

Its active international presence and a broad geographical reach require the Group to enter into transactions like sales and purchase denominated in foreign currencies. Some of the Group's borrowings and other financial liabilities are also denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes the Group to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.

37.2 Interest rate risk

The Group companies use interest-bearing liabilities. Therefore, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk, with the risk assessment presented based on a 1% increase/decrease in interest rates.

Year ended Dec 31 2014
+/- 14 +/- 471

For the purposes of the assessment the average interest rate was assumed at 7.4% for 2015 and 7.0% for 2014. Total borrowings in 2015 amounted to PLN 69,319 (2014: PLN 47,075). The effect of interest rate movements on profit or loss and equity was calculated by adding/deducting 1pp to/from the average interest rate.
The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce to an acceptable level by the Group to adverse changes in market interest rates on cash flows.
37.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may face problems with meeting its financial liabilities. Liquidity risk is managed by projecting future cash flows, analysing the relation of liquid assets to cash flows, monitoring liquidity ratios based on items of the statement of financial position and ensuring constant access to various sources of financing at the level of individual Group companies.
The Group also manages its liquidity risk by maintaining available unused credit facilities which serve as a liquidity reserve securing solvency and financial flexibility. The Group considers its bank borrowings as financial instruments that may potentially lead to a concentration of liquidity risk as the Company enters into cooperation with selected financial institutions only (see Note 24). As at December 31st 2015, bank borrowings represented 13% of total current liabilities (December 31st 2014: 16%).

The maturity structure of liabilities is presented in Note 27.

37.4 Credit risk
The Group operates a policy of selling its products and services only to customers whose credibility has been verified. Management believes that thanks to this policy there is no additional credit risk beyond the level defined by the impairment losses recognised with respect to uncollectible trade receivables. The Group discloses no past due receivables which would not have been deemed uncollectible.
The Group defines its exposure to credit risk as the total amount of outstanding receivables and monitors the balances owed by each customer on a regular basis. As at December 31st 2015, the share of receivables from one of the customers was in the range 10%­15% of total net trade receivables. The maturity structure of receivables is presented in Note 19.
The Group manages credit risk to counterparties mainly through the use of the following mechanisms and techniques: - Assessment of the financial standing of contractors, along with giving credit limits; - Standardization of contractual provisions in the field of credit risk; - A system of ongoing monitoring of payment; - Ongoing monitoring of the financial condition of the counterparty.
Note 38. MANAGEMENT STOCK OPTIONS
With a view to providing additional incentives to the Company's management staff to continue work on the development and consolidation of the SECO/WARWICK Group, and to further increase the value of SECO/WARWICK shares, on May 28th 2012 the Annual General Meeting approved the key objectives of the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme for members of the SECO/WARWICK Group's management staff (the "2012­2016 Incentive Scheme").
Key terms of the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme:
1. The person serving as President of the Management Board as at the date of the Resolution ("President of the Management Board") and the key company employees indicated by the President of the Management Board in consultation with the Supervisory Board (jointly with the President of the Management Board - the "Eligible

Persons") will be eligible for participation in the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme. With respect to each Eligible Person other than the President of the Management Board, an ai ratio, referred to in Par. 2.11 below, will be determined along with the indication of the person. A list of Eligible Persons will be prepared by the Supervisory Board in consultation with the President of the Management Board within three months from the date of the Resolution.
2. The 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme will include up to 500,000 (five hundred thousand) of Company Series E Shares ("Series E Shares"). The President of the Management Board will be entitled to acquire up to 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) Series E Shares, and the other Eligible Persons will have the right to acquire the maximum of the remaining 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) Series E Shares.
3. Under the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme, Eligible Persons will be entitled to acquire Series B subscription warrants ("Series B Warrants") free of charge. Series B Warrants will confer the right to acquire Series E Shares at their par value of PLN 0.20 (twenty grosz) per share.
4. One Series B Warrant will confer the right to acquire one Series E Share.
5. The 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme will be implemented by way of resolutions passed by the General Meeting on conditional share capital increase by up to PLN 100,000 (one hundred thousand zloty), through an issue of up to 500,000 (five hundred thousand) Series E Shares and an issue of up to 500,000 (five hundred thousand) Series B Warrants, with full waiver of the existing shareholders' pre-emptive rights to all Series E Shares and Series B Warrants.
6. The 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme is planned to cover a period of four years starting from the date of its approval by the General Meeting. The duration of the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme may be extended by the Supervisory Board making relevant changes in the Rules of the Incentive Scheme.
7. The number of Series B Warrants issued to Eligible Persons will depend on:
(i) the price of the Company shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange ("WSE"), or
(ii) the selling price of shares, whether sold in one or more transactions (including as part of a tender offer), conferring the rights to at least 33% (thirty-thee per cent) of the total votes at the General Meeting, by a shareholder or shareholders acting jointly under a memorandum of understanding, agreement, arrangement, or as part of any other relationship in fact or in law, holding in aggregate, directly or indirectly, Company shares conferring the right to at least 33% (thirty-thee per cent) of the total votes at the General Meeting ("Major Shareholder"; the term may refer to one or more shareholders acting jointly), to a third party (other than a Major Shareholder or a related party of any of the Major Shareholders). If the shares are sold by a Major Shareholder in more than one transaction, then the number of Series B Warrants to be issued to Eligible Persons will be calculated on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the selling prices in all the transactions, weighted by the number of the Company shares sold in a given transaction.
8. An Eligible Person will be entitled to acquire Series B Warrants a number of times during the term of the Incentive Scheme, however, not more frequently than twice in a calendar year. The limited frequency with which the right to acquire Series B Warrants may be exercised does not apply when the exercise of the right by an Eligible Person is based on the sale of the Company shares by a Major Shareholder.
9. An Eligible Person will be entitled to acquire Series B Warrants if:
(i) the average price of the Company shares from the 6 (six) months immediately preceding the date of acquiring Series B Warrants by the Eligible Person is at least PLN 35 (thirty-five zloty) per share, or
(ii) a Major Shareholder decides to sell at least 33% (thirty-three per cent) of all Company shares to an entity other than a Major Shareholder or a related party of a Major Shareholder, at a price of at least PLN 35 (thirty-five zloty) per share. An Eligible Person may acquire Series B Warrants no sooner than 3 (three) months from the date of notifying the Company of his or her intention to acquire Series B Warrants. The Company will procure that Series B Warrants are issued to Eligible Persons no later than within 4 (four) months following the receipt of the notification. Series B Warrants may be issued through an investment firm, acting as a custodian.
10. The maximum number of Series B Warrants which may be acquired by the President of the Management Board will be calculated based on the following formula:
provided that:

Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2014
where: Q stands for the number of Series B Warrants; P stands for, as the case may be, (i) the average price of the Company shares in the 6 (six) months immediately preceding the date of acquiring Series B Warrants by the President of the Management Board, or (ii) the price of one Company share sold in a transaction between a Major Shareholder and a buyer. If the number of Series B Warrants which may be acquired by the President of the Management Board as determined based on the above formula is not an integer, such number will be rounded down to the nearest integer. Each time the President of the Management Board exercises his or her right to acquire Series B Warrants, the number of Series B Warrants to which he or she is entitled will be reduced, in accordance with the above formula, by the number of Series B Warrants previously issued to the President of the Management Board under the 2012­ 2016 Incentive Scheme. 11. The maximum number of Series B Warrants which may be acquired by an Eligible Person other than the President of the Management Board will be calculated based on the following formula:
provided that:

where:
Q stands for the number of Series B Warrants;
P stands for, as the case may be, (i) the average price of the Company shares in the 6 (six) months immediately preceding the date of acquiring Series B Warrants by the given Eligible Person, or (ii) the price of one Company share sold in a transaction between a Major Shareholder and a buyer.
ai is a ratio determined individually for each Eligible Person, provided that:

If the number of Series B Warrants which may be acquired by an Eligible Person as determined based on the above formula is not an integer, such number will be rounded down to the nearest integer.
Each time an Eligible Person exercises his or her right to acquire Series B Warrants, the number of Series B Warrants to which he or she is entitled will be reduced, in accordance with the above formula, by the number of Series B Warrants previously issued to the Eligible Person under the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme.
12. The number of Series B Warrants acquired by each Eligible Person will in no event be higher than: (i) 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) in the case of Series B Warrants acquired by the President of the Management Board; and (ii) ai × 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) in the case of an Eligible Person other than the President of the Management Board.
13. The Eligible Person who has acquired Series B Warrants under the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme will be entitled to acquire Series E Shares at any time, however, no later than by December 31st 2016.
The incentive scheme was valued by an actuary. In the valuation, it was assumed that the share price process is a stochastic process following a geometric Brownian motion, and as such it is the solution of a stochastic differential equation. In order to measure the fair value of the awarded rights, the cost of implementation of an investment strategy whose final value would equal the value of the rights was determined (for every possible scenario). Only strategies allowing for investments in company shares and bonds were considered. The calculations were made on the assumption

that no arbitrage is available on the WSE and that the costs of dynamic portfolio reorganisation are negligible. The valuation technique was used to determine a risk-neutral measure equivalent to the measure adopted (resulting from the assumptions on price dynamics) and the expected payment amount under the new measure. In calculating the value of the rights, Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used. The adopted method is commonly used for the valuation of derivative instruments and it is compliant with IFRS 2. It is an approximation to the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
The fair value of the scheme covering 500,000 options is PLN 8,519 thousand, assuming that all non-market conditions will be met.
As at December 31st 2015, 261,627 Series E Shares had been acquired under the 2012­2016 Incentive Scheme for management personnel of the SECO/WARWICK Group, approved by virtue of Resolution No. 21 of the Annual General Meeting of May 28th 2012, of which: - 132,325 Series E Shares, with a fair value of PLN 2,997 thousand, were acquired by Pawel Wyrzykowski, President of the Management Board; - 25,558 Series E Shares, with a fair value of PLN 575 thousand, were acquired by Wojciech Modrzyk, Vice-President of the Management Board; - 25,558 Series E Shares, with a fair value of PLN 575 thousand were acquired by Jaroslaw Talerzak, Vice-President of the Management Board. The remaining shares were acquired by the other members of the management team.

Note 39. CAPITALISED BORROWING COSTS In the presented reporting periods, the Group companies did not capitalise any borrowing costs.
Note 40. REVENUE GENERATED SEASONALLY, CYCLICALLY OR OCCASIONALLY In the presented reporting periods, there were no material items of seasonal, cyclical or occasional revenue at the Group.
Note 41. COURT PROCEEDINGS
Seco/Warwick Corporation (SWC), a subsidiary of the Issuer, with its registered office in Pennsylvania, USA, along with a third party not associated with the Issuer ("Third Party"), are parties to a court dispute with Liberty Mutual Insurance (LMI), in which they claim from LMI additional insurance limits for continued product liability insurance coverage under insurance policies issued to the Third Party in 1980-1986. SWC and the Third Party are seeking coverage for the claims being raised against SWC and the Third Party in connection with product liability personal injury lawsuits filed by individuals alleging injury from asbestos as a result of their exposure to the Third Party's products manufactured by legal predecessors of SWC and the Third Party in 1958-1984 (the Asbestos Claims). SWC was not established until 1984, and was not a part of the Issuer's Group until 2006.
SWC and the Third Party have alleged in court that the insurance policy contract entered into by LMI extends additional coverage to the Asbestos Claims, including the costs of settlements entered into with injured parties and the legal costs in connection with verifying the legitimacy of such claims and negotiating such settlements. LMI claims that the policy limits have been exhausted, citing certain special provisions of the insurance policy. SWC and the Third Party disagree with LMI's contract interpretation.

THE SECO/WARWICK GROUP
Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2014
To the best of the Issuer's knowledge, by the date of this Report, 409 Asbestos Claims have been filed against SWC, out of which 124 such Claims were rejected, 31 Claims ended in settlements entered into by LMI for the total amount of USD 3m, and 252 Claims are being verified or negotiations of the terms of settlements, if any, with injured parties are being conducted in respect thereof.
Should no agreement be reached with LMI on continued insurance coverage for SWC or should the lawsuit against LMI be dismissed in this respect, there arises the risk that SWC will be forced to bear the costs relating to the Asbestos Claims while SWC and the Third Party pursue the excess carriers to take over the asbestos product liability claims.
To the best of the Issuer's knowledge, the risk of SWC being forced to bear further costs relating to the Asbestos Claims is not significant, as the Third Party holds other excess insurance policies contracted with other insurance companies, which policies can, according to the information received from SWC, cover the Asbestos Claims.
As at the date of this Report, the Issuer is not able to reliably estimate the total amount of its contingent liability related to the claims discussed above. The Issuer will publish any important information regarding the matter.
Note 42. TAX SETTLEMENTS Tax settlements and other regulated areas of activity (e.g. customs or foreign exchange control) are subject to inspection by competent administration authorities, which are authorised to impose high penalties and sanctions. Lack of reference to well-established legal regulation in Poland has resulted in ambiguity and inconsistency of the applicable laws and regulations. Frequent differences of opinion on the legal interpretation of tax laws, both between different governmental authorities and between governmental authorities and companies, create areas of uncertainty and conflicts. Therefore, the tax risk in Poland is significantly higher than is usually the case in countries with more developed tax systems.
Tax settlements may be subject to tax inspection for a period of five years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax payment was made. As a result of such inspections, additional tax liabilities may be assessed with respect to the tax settlements made by the Group. In the Management Board's opinion, as at December 31st 2015, there was no need to recognise provisions for any recognised and measurable tax risks. The Company pays its tax liabilities when due.
Note 43. WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT In the reporting periods presented, the Group recorded no events that would have to be disclosed in Note 43.
Note 44. EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD
