LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholders,
Besi generated solid results in 2019 against the backdrop of an industry downturn which persisted for most of the year. Consistent with a difficult market environment, revenue of  356.2 million and net income of  81.3 million declined by 32% and 40%, respectively, versus 2018. Revenue development was negatively influenced by supply/demand imbalances which began in Q2-18 post the large capacity build in 2017 and continued throughout 2019. In addition, revenue was also adversely affected by high levels of customer uncertainty caused by trade tensions between the US and China, particularly during the second and third quarters. Despite such headwinds, Besi achieved strong levels of profitability and efficiency as we further reduced overhead levels in alignment with market conditions, adjusted our Asian production model to reflect changing global supply chain realities and increased development efforts in preparation for the next customer investment round. Moreover, we realized quarterly gross margins in excess of 55% throughout the year, reduced base line operating expenses to their lowest levels since 2015 and maintained high levels of cash flow efficiency. In fact, operating income and operating margins in 2019, the bottom of this current downcycle, increased by 58.7% and 9.2 points, respectively, in comparison to the last industry downturn in 2015, on roughly comparable revenue levels ( 356.2 million versus  349.2 million).
Our favorable results during the current downturn demonstrate the improved scalability and profitability of our business model both in strong industry upcycles such as 2017 as well as during the sharp downdraft experienced in 2018 and 2019. As a result, Besi maintained peer leading metrics of profitability such as gross and net margins (55.8% and 22.8%, respectively) and return on equity (24.2%). We successfully reduced costs in the face of lower customer demand as a result of the ongoing execution of strategic initiatives including a 9.3% reduction in fixed overhead and tight control of inventory and supply chain activities. Besi's spares/ service activities also helped provide some cushion during this downturn. This less cyclical, high margin business generated revenue equal to approximately 20% of consolidated revenue in 2019.

Besi ended the year with a solid liquidity base consisting of cash, cash equivalents and deposits aggregating  408.4 million ( 5.66 per basic share) which positions us favorably to take advantage of future growth opportunities. In addition, we bolstered our financing resources by securing a five-year,  80 million revolving credit facility in July 2019 with a consortium of leading European banks. The facility can be expanded to  136 million and its maturity extended to seven years at our discretion. We are pleased to add this flexible financing layer to Besi's capital structure, which replaces and centralizes various credit facilities at subsidiary levels.
Shareholders were rewarded for their investment in Besi both by our capital allocation policy and share price performance this year. In 2019,  167.1 million was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since 2011, total dividends and share repurchases have aggregated to  652.9 million. Moreover, share repurchase activities since 2011 have enabled us to accumulate approximately 7.9 million shares in treasury by December 31, 2019 at an average cost per share of  15.05. In the aggregate, share repurchases equaled 9.8% of total shares outstanding at year end.

In addition, Besi's shareholder total return was 98.7% in 2019 versus a 71.3% return by our most comparable peers and a 66.5% return for the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor ("SOX") index. Further, over the past five years, Besi's stock has produced a cumulative total return of 395.7%, significantly outpacing returns of both our peers and the SOX index. We can also report a significant expansion of our investor base this year, with numerous US, UK and European institutions now added to Besi's shareholder community.
Given profits earned in 2019 and Besi's solid financial position, we propose to pay a cash dividend of  1.01 per share for approval at Besi's AGM to be held on April 30, 2020. The proposed distribution is the ninth consecutive annual dividend paid and reflects a pay-out ratio relative to net income of 90%.
Business review
Semiconductor assembly equipment market declined significantly in 2019 versus 2018. Indications of a renewed industry upturn appeared in Q4-19 VLSI Research currently estimates that the semiconductor assembly equipment market declined by 30.4% in 2019 to reach a cyclical low of approximately $ 3.0 billion. The current 2019 estimate reflects a much more negative outcome than the 5% decrease initially forecast as late as July 2019 and underlines the severity of the 2018-2019 downturn.

Source: VLSI January 2020

Looking forward, VLSI estimates that growth will return to the assembly equipment market with increases of 10.3% and 7.2% forecast for 2020 and 2021, respectively. VLSI believes that an upturn began in Q4-19 after an extended downturn of five to six quarters. Growth will be driven primarily by 5G network expansion, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Everything, innovations in packaging technology and the gradual reduction of excess industry capacity.

Strategically well positioned for next generation of electronics applications We believe that we are in the early stages of a transition to a digital society accompanied by a new generation of electronics applications. In such a society, intelligence and electronic content in all facets of our life will increase such as smart mobility, homes, factories, municipalities and transportation to name just a few. Already, we see evidence daily of productivity enhancing technologies such as cloud computing, 5G networks, artificial intelligence, data mining and predictive analysis, autonomous driving, robotics and blockchain software. In response, new leading-edge semiconductor devices are being developed this investment cycle which will play a critical role in furthering the use of many such applications.
Consistent with these trends, a new technology cycle is underway wherein customers increasingly demand more complex advanced packaging solutions containing ever more functionality in ever smaller form factors. Advanced packaging is now recognized by customers as a critical part of the semiconductor value chain to produce next generation devices. As such, Besi is actively involved with the leading semiconductor producers and supply chains at an early stage in the design process.

Successful strategic plan execution enhances revenue and profit potential in next industry upcycle One of Besi's core strengths lies in its disciplined focus on expanding the revenue and profit potential of its business model. Besi's Board of Management reviews its strategy on a semi-annual basis. In addition, an independent consulting firm was engaged both in 2016 and 2019 to assess our strategic plan and long-term value creation model. Specific revenue and cost initiatives have been created for the next planning phase (2020-2025) and owners and targets designated.

Besi's new strategic plan includes initiatives to increase our market presence, revenue growth and market share. Revenue initiatives focus primarily on our largest end-user application markets: mobile internet, computing and automotive and the expansion of our addressable market and market share within each of these verticals. We estimate that these three areas represented approximately 32%, 22% and 17%, respectively, of our revenue in 2019.
Revenue initiatives In our largest market, mobile internet devices, there are many opportunities for future growth. A significant customer focus for the next investment round is the development of die bonding and packaging solutions for smaller, highly complex and feature packed 5G compatible smart phones. 5G is a unifying connectivity platform for future innovation enabling secure cloud access on a continuous basis at significantly higher data and video transmission speeds. User adoption of 5G capabilities should greatly expand mobile broadband activities and accelerate the usage of artificial intelligence for the Internet of Everything. The utilization of advanced packaging processes is essential to the realization of customer development roadmaps and new device introductions.

Specifically, Besi is engaged in providing next generation mobile device capabilities such as microLED screens, 5G antennas, front-back facing cameras, multiple camera modules (8+) and enhanced 3D sensing and facial recognition features. Each of these applications has the potential to significantly increase Besi's addressable market. In addition, we look to leverage our technology position to expand opportunities in the Android market, particularly with Chinese subcontractors, as the Chinese government seeks to gain increased technological independence. We are also investing in a next generation of hybrid bonding systems to facilitate wafer level bonding integrating multiple devices at geometries as small as 7 nanometers.

Another revenue initiative is to expand Besi's reach in the logic and memory markets in the era of cloud computing, data mining and artificial intelligence. One objective is to increase the market share of Besi's flip chip and 3D stacked die bonding solutions versus traditional wire bonding processes due to the increased complexity, accuracy and miniaturization required for next generation applications. Further, we see the introduction of high volume TCB die bonding systems for advanced memory and logic applications as another potential source of revenue growth given the push to <5 nano device geometries. In the automotive sector, Besi seeks to increase its share of existing European and North American customers due to the higher electronic content, performance and safety standards required for such markets. We also actively support customers in the development of autonomous driving applications and seek to expand our share of Japanese automotive supply chains.

For 2020, major CSR priorities include (i) a review of Besi's sustainability strategy with a third party consultant, (ii) improved internal reporting and monitoring of KPI compliance and target achievement during the year and (iii) the upscaling of sustainability initiatives proposed by Besi personnel for consideration by senior management.

Outlook We are cautiously optimistic as we enter 2020. It appears that the current industry downcycle which began in Q2-18 ended in Q4-19. In this regard, Besi's Q4-19 orders grew by 22% on a quarterly sequential basis, a quarter which is typically our weakest from a bookings perspective. Improved industry conditions are also evident in VLSI's climate index set forth below and supported by recent announcements from leading memory and logic producers. The impact of the COVID-19 virus on the emerging industry recovery and Besi's 2020 prospects is difficult to assess at present but could cause volatility in the development of quarterly order patterns this year.

Besi has emerged from each of the past four downcycles a stronger company with increased revenue, market share and profit potential. We have a leading position in the advanced packaging space whose outlook is bright as an important enabler of the digital society and the new applications which will be generated along with it. In combination with new strategic initiatives, a highly scalable and flexible production model and ample liquidity, we are well positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities no matter which way the market moves in the quarters to come. We are excited about our industry's prospects and the opportunities available to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.

We are also optimistic about the next five-year planning phase and the revenue and profit initiatives established. These initiatives are supported by strong long-term growth drivers for the advanced packaging segment of the assembly equipment market including 5G network adoption, artificial intelligence and the continued build out of cloud computing infrastructure to name just a few. The issue, as always, is the near-term timing and translation of these opportunities into assembly equipment orders in any given quarter or fiscal year. That is the dynamic of our industry.

In closing, we want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, business partners and shareholders for helping Besi navigate this industry downturn. Time now to focus our efforts on the many exciting growth opportunities present today as we move Besi forward in the next decade.

more efficiently both in terms of environmental impact

and cost savings, for instance by introducing products

with fewer and lighter materials. We also analyze

and investigate ways in which to reduce other

environmentally harmful materials such as the usage

We made progress on our CSR agenda in 2019, highlights of which included:
· Reduction of absolute levels of packaging, waste, water usage, hazardous materials and electricity in our operations versus 2018.
· Installation of solar panels at our principal Malaysian manufacturing facility with the objective of producing 15% of its power requirements.
· Receipt of the MISA `19 Audience Award for Besi's development of an innovative plating system to significantly increase solar panel efficiency.
· Achievement of Gold status by our Asian manufacturing operations post an RBA validated audit process.
· Development by our packaging group of a system to better evaluate environmental aspects in the product design process.
· Execution of agreements by Besi's suppliers confirming their compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances standard.
· Launch of new management training and e-learning programs at Besi's Asian manufacturing facilities.
· Initiatives undertaken to reduce travel including the usage of a new company wide video conferencing system.
Achieve a more scalable, flexible and lower cost manufacturing model The semiconductor equipment market has become increasingly more volatile in recent years due to heightened global economic uncertainty, trade tensions, changing end market applications, more seasonal purchasing patterns and shorter lead times for delivery. In response, Besi decided to fundamentally reorganize its global operations and management structure starting in 2007 to streamline operations, transfer production and supply chain activities to its Asian operations, improve returns from its product portfolio, reduce break even revenue levels and increase through cycle profitability. European and North American headcount was significantly reduced, inefficient operations closed and substantially all European production and all tooling capacity were transferred to our Malaysian and Chinese facilities.

In addition, strategic initiatives were implemented to: · Increase the scalability and flexibility of Besi's
production model via the use of temporary Asian production personnel and the establishment of a high quality Asian supply chain network. · Lower unit manufacturing costs and cycle times. · Increase material cost efficiencies through common platform design and vendor consolidation. · Transfer certain logistics, software support and technical personnel from Europe to Asia. · Develop and staff an Asian sales, customer support and development center in Singapore. · Expand Besi's Chinese production capabilities and Asian production flexibility. · Reduce European facility space and fixed headcount. · Simplify and harmonize diverse manufacturing and IT processes. · Roll out and implement the SAP ERP system to all operations worldwide.
As a result, Besi has significantly reduced labor, material and overhead costs, improved delivery times and inventory turnover and enhanced its local customer presence. We have also been able to upwardly and downwardly scale our operations in response to volatile industry trends during the 2017-2019 period while consistently maintaining gross margins in excess of 55%. Increased scalability combined with tight inventory control have also greatly expanded Besi's cash generation capabilities and market share potential.
Key operational highlights in 2019 included: · The realignment of Asian production in response
to global trade tensions wherein Besi's Chinese production is now primarily focused on Chinese customers. · A 9.3% headcount reduction versus year end 2018 consistent with an ongoing industry downturn. · The continued transfer of general and administrative functions from Europe to Singapore.

Expand our Asian operations, capabilities and supply chain activities Besi has pursued strategic initiatives and made capital investments over the past decade in an effort to improve profitability, expand production capacity and better service a customer base that migrated from Europe and North America to Asia. In 2019, approximately 72% of revenue was derived from sales to Asian customer locations. In particular, we have funded expansions of our Malaysian and Chinese production facilities and Singapore development/sales and service center over the past five years to expand capacity and better service our Asian customer base.
In the Besi operating model, all system production, sourcing, product applications engineering, process and software support and tooling/spares operations take place at Besi's Asian locations. All product ownership and new product development remains at our European operations. Only highly customized systems are produced in Europe for which we generate attractive gross margins. In recent years, Besi has diversified its Asian manufacturing and engineering capabilities and significantly increased the scope of operations in China and Singapore to further drive cost reduction, increase capacity, technical and field service support and enhance our local customer presence. Additional selling, general and administrative functions will be transferred over the next five years from Besi's European locations to its operations in Singapore, Malaysia and China.
In addition, we have actively developed and qualified local supply chains for each of our Malaysian and Chinese operations which produce substantially all components, modules and subassemblies used in our assembly and plating system production. The successful development of a flexible Asian supply chain is an important factor in our profitable navigation of volatile semiconductor equipment markets and low capital intensity.
GEOGRAPHIC HEADCOUNT TRENDS*

Exceed industry average benchmarks of financial performance. Create long-term value for shareholders The successful execution of Besi's strategic plan and long-term valuation model has significantly benefited shareholders. Peer leading financial metrics have been achieved in the areas of gross, operating and net margin. Our addressable market share has also increased. In addition, Besi's capital allocation plan has resulted in the distribution to shareholders of  652.9 million since 2011 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, of which  167.1 million was distributed in 2019. Profit generation and capital allocation have also resulted in peer leading return on average equity of 24.2% in 2019 and an average of 27.3% over the past five years. Finally, shareholders have benefited from an increase of 98.7%, 160.1% and 395.7%, respectively, in their total stock market return (share price appreciation plus dividends) from an investment in Besi over the past year, three years and five years. This total return significantly exceeded total returns from an investment in the Philadelphia SOX index of leading semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies and our peer group of assembly equipment companies during such periods.
Selectively acquire companies with complementary technologies and products In order to provide customers with leading edge process solutions, it is critically important to identify and incorporate new technologies on a timely and continuous basis. As a result, Besi actively identifies and evaluates acquisition candidates that can assist it in (i) maintaining process technology leadership, (ii) increasing market share in those assembly markets with the greatest long-term potential such as wafer level packaging, (iii) enhancing the productivity and efficiency of our Asian manufacturing operations and (iv) growing less cyclical, "non-system" related revenues from tooling, spares and service.
Besi has made four important acquisitions which have furthered its advanced packaging strategy, accelerated underlying organic growth and generated significant long-term value creation for stakeholders:

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Financial Review

General BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. ("Besi" or the "Company") is engaged in one line of business, the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service of semiconductor assembly equipment for the global semiconductor and electronics industries. Since Besi operates in one segment and in one group of similar products and services, all financial segment and product line information can be found in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Besi's revenue and results of operations depend in significant part on the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and for products utilizing semi conductors. Demand for semiconductor devices and expenditures for the equipment required to assemble semiconductors is highly cyclical, depending in large part on levels of demand worldwide for smart phones, tablets and other personal productivity devices, computing and peripheral equipment and automotive and industrial components, as well as the production capacity of global semiconductor manufacturers. Furthermore, a rise or fall in the sales levels of semiconductor equipment typically lags any downturn or recovery in the semiconductor market due to the lead times associated with the production of semiconductor equipment.
In recent years, Besi has experienced significant upward and downward movements in quarterly order rates due to global macroeconomic concerns, trade tensions and increased seasonality of end-user application revenue. Customer order patterns have become increasingly more seasonal due to the growing influence of more retail oriented electronics applications in the overall demand for semiconductor devices such as smart phones, tablets, wearable devices and automotive electronics. Order patterns have been characterized typically by a strong upward ramp in the first half of the year to build

capacity for anticipated year end demand followed by a subsequent decline in the second half of the year as capacity additions are digested by customers. Volatile global macroeconomic conditions and seasonal influences have also contributed to the significant upward and downward movements in Besi's quarterly and semi-annual revenue and net income.
Besi's revenue is generated primarily by shipments to the Asian manufacturing operations of leading European and American independent device manufacturers ("IDMs") and Taiwanese, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other Asian IDMs and subcontractors. Besi's sales to individual customers tend to vary significantly from year to year depending on global economic conditions generally and the specific capital expenditure budgets, new product introductions, production capacity and packaging requirements of its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer represented 10.5% of Besi's revenue and its largest 10 customers accounted for 44.1% of revenue. In addition, Besi derives a substantial portion of its revenue from products that have an average selling price in excess of  300,000 and that have lead times of approximately 4-12 weeks between the initial order and delivery of the product. The timing and recognition of revenue from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Besi only recognizes orders upon receipt and acceptance of a firm purchase order.
Corporate and financial structure Besi's corporate organization consists of a Dutch holding company in which shareholders own ordinary shares and a network of wholly-owned subsidiaries located globally which reflects its product group and business activities. To get a better overview of Besi's largest shareholders, reference is made to the Shareholder Information section of the Annual Report.

Besi's quarterly results of operations in 2019 were adversely affected by an industry downturn which commenced in the second half of 2018 and continued throughout the year. In addition, quarterly results relative to 2018 were also adversely affected by global trade tensions, particularly between the United States and China, which increased customer caution relative to the timing of new order placement and created significant uncertainty as to the functioning of global supply chains. The impact of the industry downturn was felt across Besi's product portfolio, with particular weakness experienced in mobile internet and automotive applications.
In recent years, Besi's first half year revenue and net income have increased as compared to the prior semi-annual period as customers significantly added incremental semiconductor assembly capacity to meet rising orders for smart phones and automotive electronics and new device introductions. Typically, the seasonal upcycle has ended by early summer as customers digested incremental capacity additions made in the first half year.

This pattern held for 2018 but varied significantly in 2019 relative to historical trends. During 2019, order and revenue patterns varied by only a small amount sequentially due to the length and depth of the current industry downturn.

(32.2%) (27.8%) (34.9%) (12.8%)

Besi's revenue decreased by  169.1 million, or 32.2%, in 2019 versus 2018. Besi's revenue development was negatively influenced by supply/demand imbalances which began in Q2-18 post the large capacity build in 2017 and continued throughout 2019. In addition, revenue was also adversely affected by high levels of customer uncertainty caused by trade tensions between the US and China, particularly during the second and third quarters. The revenue decline was broad based by product group, partially offset by favorable forex influences associated with a 5.5% average appreciation of the US dollar versus the euro.

Similarly, orders in 2019 decreased by 27.8% versus 2018. The order decrease was broad based across product lines and end-user applications, with particular weakness in orders for smart phone and automotive applications by IDM customers and their respective supply chains. In 2019, bookings by IDMs and subcontractors represented approximately 61% and 39%, respectively, of Besi's total orders versus 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2018.

Gross profit Gross profit decreased by  99.7 million, or 33.4%, versus 2018 primarily as a result of lower revenue levels. However, despite the revenue decrease, Besi's gross margin reduced only slightly to 55.8% versus 56.8% in 2018 primarily due to its realignment of temporary

production overhead and supply chain activities in response to changing market conditions. Gross margin levels in 2019 also benefited from favorable net forex influences from an appreciation of the US dollar versus the euro which more than offset increased costs from an increase in the value of the Swiss franc, Singapore dollar and US dollar versus the euro.
Selling, general and administrative expenses Total SG&A expenses decreased by  18.8 million, or 20.8%, in 2019 versus 2018. The decrease in 2019 was due primarily to (i) a  3.8 million reduction in personnel expenses as a result of lower headcount levels, (ii) a  2.7 million reduction in share-based compensation expense, (iii) a  5.5 million reduction in variable sales related costs such as warranty, commission and freight and (iv) lower overhead costs generally, particularly discretionary travel expenses. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses increased from 17.2% in 2018 to 20.1% in 2019.
Research and development expenses Besi's R&D spending is primarily focused on advancing its leadership position in advanced packaging process technology and regular system upgrades but can vary from year to year depending on specific customer roadmaps and the timing of new device introductions. R&D expense of  35.4 million in 2019 was approximately equal to 2018 levels but, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 9.9% in 2019 versus 6.7% in 2018 as a result of significantly lower revenue.
Restructuring charges Besi recorded  0.2 million and  1.0 million of restructuring charges in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to employee severance which are included in cost of sales and operating expenses.

Working capital Besi's working capital (excluding cash and debt) decreased by  25.3 million, or 31.0%, to reach  56.2 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to lower accounts receivable and inventory outstanding associated with lower sales volume as well as improvements in receivable collections and inventory management.

Capital expenditures Besi's capital expenditures declined to  2.5 million in 2019 versus  6.6 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the completion in 2018 of its Chinese production capacity expansion. Besi anticipates that capital expenditures in 2020 will range between  4 and  5 million.

2019 bank revolving credit facility On July 24, 2019, BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. entered into an  80 million revolving credit facility due 2024 with a consortium of European banks (the "2019 Facility"). The 2019 Facility can be expanded to  136 million and its maturity extended to 2026. Interest rates on borrowings under the 2019 Facility vary per currency utilized and the level of cash balances outstanding and amounts utilized. The 2019 Facility replaces and centralizes various credit facilities at subsidiary levels. It ranks pari passu with the 2016 and 2017 Convertible Notes and is secured by guarantees from certain operating subsidiaries. Borrowings under the 2019 Facility can be repaid at any time at 100% of principal amount and can be used for working capital and other corporate purposes. The principal covenants associated with the 2019 Facility include a maintenance test of consolidated debt to equity and a limitation on the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness.
Issuance of Convertible Notes On December 2, 2016, Besi issued  125 million principal amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due December 2023 (the "2016 Convertible Notes"). Interest on the 2016 Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The 2016 Convertible Notes will be repaid at maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and convert into approximately 6.3 million Besi ordinary shares at a conversion price of  19.93 (subject to adjustment). The original exercise price of  43.51 has been adjusted for the two for one stock split effective May 4, 2018 and dividends paid subsequent to the date of issuance of the 2016 Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms and conditions related thereto. The net proceeds from the offering totaled  122.7 million and were added to Besi's cash and deposits.

Besi may redeem each of the outstanding 2016 and 2017 Convertible Notes at 100% of their principal amount after December 23, 2020 (in the case of the 2016 Convertible Notes) and after December 27, 2021 (in the case of the 2017 Convertible Notes), provided that the market value of its ordinary shares exceeds 130% of the then effective conversion price for a specified period of time. In the event of a change of control (as defined), each noteholder will have the right to require Besi to redeem all (but not less than all) of its Convertible Notes at 100% of their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms and conditions governing each of the 2016 and 2017 Convertible Notes contain no incurrence tests nor maintenance covenants which could materially limit Besi's ability to conduct its operations in the normal course.
Capital allocation Besi's capital allocation policy seeks to provide a current return to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases while retaining a capital base sufficient to fund future growth opportunities.
Dividends Besi's dividend policy considers the payment of dividends on an annual basis based upon (i) a review of its annual and prospective financial performance, liquidity and financing needs, the prevailing market outlook and Besi's strategy, market position and acquisition strategy and/or (ii) a dividend payout ratio in the range of 40-100% relative to net income to be adjusted accordingly if the factors referred to under (i) so require.

Due to Besi's earnings and cash flow generation in 2019, the Board of Management will propose a cash dividend to shareholders of  1.01 per share for approval at Besi's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 30, 2020.
The payments for the year 2018 and proposed for the year 2019 represent a dividend payout ratio relative to net income of 91% and 90%, respectively.
Share repurchase program On July 26, 2018, Besi announced a  75 million share repurchase program through October 26, 2019 (the "2018 program") which represented approximately 4.2% of shares outstanding at such date. The 2018 program was initiated for capital reduction purposes and to help offset dilution associated with Besi's 2016 and 2017 Convertible Notes and share issuance under employee stock plans. On October 24, 2019, Besi extended the 2018 program for an additional year until October 26, 2020. From program inception through December 31, 2019, a total of 3.1 million shares have been repurchased at an average price of  21.91 per share for a total of  67.1 million under this program.
At present, Besi has shareholder authorization to purchase up to an aggregate of 10% of its ordinary shares outstanding (approximately 8.0 million shares) until October 26, 2020. At December 31, 2019, Besi held approximately 7.9 million shares in treasury equal to approximately 9.8% of its ordinary shares outstanding at a weighted average price of  15.05 per share.

Due to Besi's earnings and cash flow generation in 2018, the Board of Management proposed and Besi paid a cash dividend to shareholders of  1.67 per share which resulted in cash payments to shareholders of  122.4 million.

Besi believes that its cash position, internally generated funds and available lines of credit will be adequate to meet its anticipated levels of capital spending, research and development, debt service requirements, working capital and capital allocation policy for at least the next twelve months.

condition and results of operations.

Because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for its products, Besi may not succeed in closing transactions on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect its revenue and operating results. The average selling price for a material portion of Besi's equipment exceeds  300,000, and as a result of such potential investment size, the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable. Factors affecting the sales cycle include:
· Customers' capital spending plans, capacity utilization rates, technology roadmaps and budgetary constraints.

In addition, various industries have experienced consolidation and other ownership changes or the emergence of dominant firms and supply chains within those industries, including the smart phone, computing and automotive industries. Any future changes in market structure to industries in which we sell our equipment could decrease the number of potential customers for our product offerings and/or risk an increase in competition for our clients' equipment purchases. Moreover, our competitors may respond to such changes in market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers.

acceptance. Besi must also accurately forecast

industry so that its products provide the functions required by its customers and are configured for use in their facilities. Besi may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes or to specific product announcements by competitors. As a result, the introduction of new products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new or enhanced industry standards could render Besi's existing products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint, obsolete or unmarketable.
In addition, Besi is required to invest significant financial resources in the development of new products or upgrades to existing products and in its sales and marketing efforts before such products are made commercially available and before Besi is able to determine whether they will be accepted by the market. Revenue from such products will not be recognized until long after Besi has incurred the costs associated with designing, creating and selling such products. In addition, due to the rapid technological changes in its market, a customer may cancel or modify a product before it begins manufacture of the product and receives revenue from the customer. While Besi typically imposes a fee when its customers cancel an order, that fee may not be sufficient to offset the costs Besi incurred in designing and manufacturing such product. In addition, the customer may refuse or be unable to pay the cancellation fee Besi assesses. It is difficult to predict with any certainty the frequency with which customers will cancel or modify their projects or the effect that any cancellation or modification would have on Besi's results of operations.

In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent any patent issued to Besi, the rights granted under any patent issued to Besi may not provide competitive advantages and third parties may assert that Besi's products infringe patent, copyright or trade secrets of such parties. Also third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent technology which Besi licenses from third parties. If any party is able to successfully claim that Besi's creation or use of proprietary technology infringes upon their intellectual property rights, Besi may be forced to pay damages. In addition to any damages Besi may have to pay, a court could require Besi to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license which may not be available on terms which are favorable to Besi or at all.
Operational risks
Difficulties in forecasting demand for Besi's product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or surpluses. Besi typically operates its business with limited visibility of future demand. As a result, it sometimes experiences inventory shortages or surpluses. Besi generally orders supplies and otherwise plans production based on internal forecasts for demand. Besi has in the past failed, and may fail again in the future, to accurately forecast demand for its products. This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments or, alternatively, an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. If it fails to accurately forecast demand for its products, Besi's business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

Besi is largely dependent upon its international operations. Besi has manufacturing and/or sales and service facilities and personnel in the Netherlands, Austria, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Switzerland and the United States. Its products are marketed, sold and serviced worldwide. In addition, 84% of its sales in 2019 were to customers outside of Europe and 69% of its employees were located in facilities outside of Europe at year end 2019.

Besi seeks to manage its exposure to currency fluctuations in part by hedging firmly committed sales contracts denominated in US dollars.

Besi has established a Code of Conduct which governs the behavior of our employees worldwide on matters such as corruption and human rights behavior as well as integrity and ethical behavior, all of which are important values to the Company.
However, we might still encounter unethical behavior and breaches to our Code of Conduct due to intentional fraudulent behavior by individual employees. Issues can arise unintentionally as well as from a lack of adherence to appropriate rules and regulations.

Employees regularly receive EHS training. Our Malaysian operation has its own Health & Safety Committee as required by law.
CSR initiatives, progress, developments and risks related thereto are discussed regularly between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and are reported in the Annual Report including CSR, non-financial information and non-financial risks that could affect both Besi's strategy and business operations. Please refer to Risks and Risk Management for an overview of Besi's most important risks. Short and long-term topics are assessed by management through measures such as materiality analysis, key performance indicators for energy, water and waste usage, packaging, customer and employee satisfaction metrics, supplier audits and continuous stakeholder dialogue.
CSR activities 2019 We made progress on our CSR agenda in 2019, highlights of which included:
· Reduction of absolute levels of packaging, waste, water usage and electricity in our operations versus 2018.
· Installation of solar panels at our principal Malaysian manufacturing facility with the objective of producing 15% of its power requirements.
· Receipt of the MISA `19 Audience Award for Besi's development of an innovative plating system to increase solar panel efficiency.
· Achievement of Gold status by Besi's Asian manufacturing operations post an RBA validated audit process.
· Development by our packaging group of a system to better evaluate environmental aspects in the product design process.

· Execution of agreements by Besi's suppliers confirming their compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") standard.
· Launch of new management training and e-learning programs at Besi's Asian manufacturing.
· Launch of a Quality and Reliability Campaign at Besi's Malaysian and Chinese operations.
· Initiatives undertaken to reduce travel including usage of a new company wide video conferencing system.
Quality and sustainable impact of products
Customer satisfaction Customer satisfaction is an important measure to determine the level of customer fulfillment with Besi's products, services, technology and other forms of customer engagement. It also helps us to identify areas for improvement.
We regularly receive feedback about our products and services through Besi's sales and service departments and periodically through customer scoring of our performance based on designated criteria. In addition, once a year, we perform a customer satisfaction survey through which we measure our performance with customers on topics such as service and support, technological issues and quality and product management. The survey results form part of the management review per product group. Besi achieved an average score of 80% in 2019, an increase of 5% versus 2018 based on 52 survey respondents. All aspects of Besi's performance showed an upward trend with Quality being highlighted as the most important factor in our improved performance (an increase of 7% versus 2018). Besi scored highest in the areas of Project Management, Commercial & Administration and Technical Issues. Relative to competitors, customers were particularly satisfied with the reliability and durability of Besi's products as well as our technical support and customer service.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In its conflict minerals due diligence, Besi has focused on compliance with the requirements as defined in the Dodd Frank Act in the United States. In 2020, we will evaluate compliance with requirements as defined by the EU and the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals Minerals & Chemicals Importers & Exporters ("CCCMC") and prepare for an update of our Conflict Mineral Policy considering EU and Chinese standards.
The Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") is an EU directive that restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacturing of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. We believe that all our systems are compliant with the RoHS standard.

In 2019, we conducted performance reviews of 32 suppliers in Malaysia and 12 key suppliers in China representing approximately 57% of total purchasing volume. The outcomes of these reviews showed an average score of approximately 80% (out of a maximum 100%) based on certain business and quality performance criteria. We communicated the overall performance score to all key suppliers at the 2019 Annual Supplier Day. In addition, we scheduled and completed 48 annual supplier audits this year.

Environmental impact of our transportation and logistics processes The transportation of Besi's equipment, spare parts and assemblies has been a particular focus given customers' requirements for speed, reliability, cost and environmental impact. We have implemented a number of measures to improve delivery times to our predominantly Asian installed base of customers and to reduce transportation costs and their environmental impact.

Towards this end, Besi seeks to procure more goods on a local level which helps decrease aggregate transport costs and their associated environmental impact. It also can result in shorter lead times for customer deliveries. In addition, the transportation of heavy parts (>100 kg) is now carried out by sea transportation instead of by plane. If time is of the essence and sea transportation is not an option, Besi will opt for truck transit instead of air transit which results in significantly less harmful emissions. Finally, we encourage suppliers to follow our transportation and logistics methods to reduce related costs and minimize any adverse environmental impact.

Environmental impact of our business travel Employee business travel represents another aspect of Besi's impact on the environment. Employees travel frequently both locally and overseas given the global scope of our business and the need to interface with customers for sales, marketing, development and service calls.
Management is undertaking measures to reduce employee business travel. In 2019, Cisco's WebEx conferencing software was implemented company-wide to improve productivity, free up management resources, reduce business travel and lower costs. In addition, Besi's Meco plating group is piloting the use of a Hololens at customer locations such that a Besi technician can remotely analyze a service problem digitally and thus eliminate a site visit. If the pilot is deemed successful, Besi will consider applications at other product groups as well. This program offers the possibility of significant reductions in Besi's business travel, related costs and our environmental impact while substantially increasing employee productivity.
ESH awareness campaign Besi APac organizes an Environment, Safety and Health ("ESH") awareness campaign on an annual basis. In 2018, the campaign theme was `Mind your posture'. In 2019, the theme was `Beat plastic pollution' which corresponded to the United Nations theme for World Environmental Day. During the campaign, several activities were organized to raise awareness among employees of the issues involved including the removal from the canteen of all single use plastics and the distribution to employees of reusable straws and coffee cups.
Packaging and waste Besi seeks to reduce waste in its operations wherever possible. In all facilities, waste separation systems are in place and the re-use, reduce, recycle concept is communicated to employees. Our principal focus is the reduction of waste used in the packaging process wherein we use materials such as plastic, wood and cardboard to ensure proper protection. In order to minimize waste, packaging quality has been improved to better protect products during transport. Existing

Investor relations Besi uses a range of activities to initiate and maintain contact with investors. After publication of its annual and quarterly results, roadshows are held in Europe and the United States to meet existing and potential new institutional investors. Planned roadshows and presentations can be found on the Besi website. Contacts with institutional investors are further maintained by means of conference calls, conferences organized by brokers and Euronext and by investor visits to Besi.
The Company's investor outreach includes meetings with institutional and retail investors, research analysts, private investors, journalists and media outlets to help communicate the Besi story to the investment community and general public. Shareholders are also engaged through quarterly and annual conference calls and participation at Besi's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ("AGM").
Investors in Europe and North American markets are increasingly considering sustainability and CSR themes as part of their investment process. Investors are requesting more CSR information from us than in previous years particularly in the areas of conflict minerals and climate change as well as fossil fuel and CO2 reduction strategies and human rights within the supply chain. Shareholders expect Besi to protect their investment and provide a competitive return on invested capital while operating responsibly as a corporate citizen. Besi has engaged in important face to face dialogue with such stakeholders and received valuable feedback about its business and CSR issues in its 2019 investor relations program.

Important investor relations dates in 2020 that are currently planned (subject to change) are as follows:

Prevention insider trading Besi has implemented a Code of Conduct governing the use of inside information by the members of the Supervisory Board, the member of the Board of Management and any other designated persons, including key staff members. In addition, there is a separate Code of Conduct governing the use of inside information by Besi employees generally. Designated persons have agreed in writing to observe the relevant Code of Conduct concerning the reporting and regulation of transactions in Besi securities (and other designated securities) and the treatment of price-sensitive information. Besi has appointed a compliance officer who is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Codes of Conduct and communication with the AFM.

Besi Incentive Plan Besi may grant performance shares on an annual conditional basis to the member of the Board of Management, key employees and officers under the current Besi Incentive Plan. Further information on this subject is given in the Remuneration Report.

In determining the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board also takes into account the impact of the overall remuneration of the Board of Management with respect to pay differentials in the Company.
In its evaluation of the efficacy of Besi's Remuneration Policy, the Supervisory Board has performed in-depth scenario analyses of the variable remuneration components under the policy. The probability of vesting and pay-out of the performance share awards have been taken into account in these scenario analyses. The Supervisory Board has set the performance targets on the basis of the outcome of the scenario analyses. Pay differentials and the executive's position within Besi have also been considered and discussed, including the internal pay ratio. In 2019, the internal pay ratio was 37 (2018: 39) based on the annual total remuneration of the member of the Board of Management and the average total remuneration of all other full-time employees, as reported in accordance with IFRS, excluding discretionary elements.

Conditional award The number of performance shares conditionally awarded will be determined by the Supervisory Board based on at target level equal to 100% of the individual's gross annual base salary, as follows:
At target number of performance shares to be awarded is determined based on (i) 100% of the individual's gross annual base salary, divided by (ii) the average closing price of Besi's shares for all trading days in the calendar quarter immediately preceding the start of the threeyear performance period.
Vesting At the end of the three-year performance period, depending on Besi's actual performance during the performance period, the number of shares that become unconditional (i.e. number of shares vesting) will be determined. Vested shares are subject to a two-year lock-up period which means that the member of the Board of Management will have to retain them for two years following the vesting date. However, he will be allowed to sell sufficient shares to cover the income tax liability upon vesting of the performance shares. The actual number of performance shares which will vest at the end of the three-year performance period will be determined based on the following grid:

The performance shares awarded subject to Besi's TSR performance are based on the actual absolute ranking of Besi within the comparator group and vest in a range between 0% and 75% of the total number of performance shares awarded to the individual. The vesting is determined based on the following schedule:

Performance adjustment After evaluating the three-year performance period for awards made from 2017 up to and including 2019, the Supervisory Board may at its absolute discretion upwardly or downwardly adjust the number of performance shares that will vest by a maximum of 20%. This discretionary performance adjustment may be applied by the Supervisory Board to reflect the overall performance achieved and market developments, and further aligns the interests of members of the Board of Management with those of shareholders.

Loans At the end of 2019, no loans, advances or guarantees were outstanding to the CEO in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
Remuneration Supervisory Board members The remuneration of Supervisory Board members is reviewed on an annual basis. Effective April 26, 2018, the General Meeting of Shareholders approved the proposal of the Supervisory Board, upon recommendation of the Committee, to upwardly adjust the remuneration of the Supervisory Board by 10% given that the last adjustment was made in 2014 and in light of the associated increase in the responsibilities, workload and liabilities of Supervisory Board members during such time given Besi's growth. Furthermore, an intercontinental travel allowance was introduced and approved in order to retain and attract international Supervisory Board members based on a review by an independent external expert utilizing a compensation benchmark of AMX companies. The AMX companies were selected based on their comparable size and market capitalization as determined by Euronext Amsterdam.

The current remuneration of Supervisory Board members is as follows:
· Member of the Supervisory Board, including committee membership(s):  62,700.
· Member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of a committee:  66,000.
· Chairman of the Supervisory Board:  79,200. · Meeting attendance fees, including conference calls:
none. · Intercontinental travel allowance:  6,000 for physical
attendance of at least three meetings.
Currently no formal Remuneration Policy is in place for Supervisory Board members. As required by Dutch law, a Remuneration Policy will be proposed to the General Meeting of Shareholders on April 30, 2020.
The members of the Supervisory Board are not entitled to any performance or equity related compensation and are not entitled to any pension allowance or contribution.
Loans At the end of 2019, no loans, advances or guarantees were outstanding for each of the members of the Supervisory Board.

The total cash remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

Report of the Supervisory Board

Besi is pleased to present its 2019 Annual Report prepared by the Board of Management. The Annual Report includes Besi's Financial Statements as prepared by the Board of Management for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. At its meeting on February 19, 2020, the Supervisory Board approved these Financial Statements. Ernst & Young Accountants LLP ("EY"), independent external auditors, duly examined the 2019 Besi Financial Statements and issued an unqualified opinion thereon.
The Supervisory Board recommends that the General Meeting of Shareholders adopts the 2019 Financial Statements as submitted by the Board of Management and approved by the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management has also submitted a proposal stating that a cash dividend of  1.01 per share will be declared for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Supervision Besi has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board that is responsible for supervising and guiding the Board of Management. The Board of Management is currently comprised of one member, Mr Richard Blickman. The Supervisory Board is currently comprised of five members, all of whom are considered independent within the meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the independence requirements referred to in best practice provisions 2.1.7 to 2.1.9 (inclusive) of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code have been fulfilled.

expertise, background, competencies and independence to carry out its duties properly and that all members of the Supervisory Board have sufficient time to spend on their respective duties and responsibilities.
The Supervisory Board currently has a diverse composition in terms of experience, background, competencies, education and nationality and is on all those points in line with the objectives of its diversity policy and Supervisory Board profile. Diversity in general and gender diversity in particular are important factors in the selection process of Supervisory Board candidates. When considering new candidates, the Supervisory Board will retain an active and open attitude with respect to the selection of female candidates. Gender is, however, only one factor of diversity. The qualifications of a particular person and the requirements for the position shall always prevail over all other factors and considerations when filling a vacancy.
During 2019, the Supervisory Board held seven meetings, of which three consisted of conference calls and two were combined meetings of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. Further, the Supervisory Board made a full week trip to visit Besi Leshan, China, Besi Singapore and Besi APac in Shah Alam, Malaysia. During 2019, one member was absent with notice for two Supervisory Board meetings and one member was absent with notice for one Supervisory Board meeting.
Supervisory Board meeting topics Key topics discussed by the Supervisory Board during 2019 included:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Basis of presentation

General BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. ("Besi" or "the Company") was incorporated in the Netherlands in May 1995 as the holding company for a worldwide business engaged in the development, production, marketing and sales of back-end equipment for the semiconductor industry. BE Semiconductor Industries N.V.`s principal operations are in the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Malaysia, Singapore and China. BE Semiconductor Industries N.V.`s principal executive office is located at Ratio 6, 6921 RW Duiven, the Netherlands. Statutory seat of the Company is Amsterdam; number at Chamber of Commerce is 09092395.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. for the year ended December 31, 2019, were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on February 19, 2020. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as at December 31, 2019 will be presented to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for their adoption on April 30, 2020.

Statement of compliance The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the European Union. They also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in section 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, as far as applicable.

This is the first set of the Company's annual financial statements in which IFRS 16 Leases has been applied. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in Note 2.

2. Summary of significant accounting principles

Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company"). The financial statements are presented in thousands of euro, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise. The accounting principles which the Company uses to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements are based on historical cost, unless stated otherwise. Exceptions to the historical cost basis include derivative financial instruments and share-based compensation which are based on fair value. In addition, for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, actuarial present value calculations are used.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

At the AGM of April 26, 2018, the General Meeting of Shareholders approved a stock split of the Company's shares, effective May 4, 2018 whereby each issued ordinary share was split into two shares. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share and per share information included in the financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. and its

subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity

when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect

those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated

Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial

statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent

accounting policies. All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealized gains and losses resulting from intra-

94

group transactions are eliminated in full. Accounting policies, as set out below, have been applied consistently for all

periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and by all subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the following subsidiaries are included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Foreign currency translation The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company's functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are:

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are accounted for into the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their Statement of Comprehensive Income is translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation of assets and liabilities are recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"), and presented as legal currency translation adjustment in equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Changes in accounting policies Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has applied IFRS 16 as from January 1, 2019. Due to the transition method chosen by the Company in applying this standard, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not been restated to reflect the requirements of the new standards.

A number of other new standards and amendments are also effective as from January 1, 2019 but they do not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. These new standards and amendments are as follows: · IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments · Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement · Annual IFRS Improvement Process (Amendments to IFRS 3, 11 and IAS 12, 23)

IFRS 16 - Leases The Company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated ­ i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations. The Company also elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at commencement date had a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ("short-term leases") and lease contract for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low value assets"). As a lessee, the Company leases assets including land and building, equipment and company cars.

At transition, the Company has applied the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. The lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Company's incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2019. Right of use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid payments. The Company used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17: · Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics and country. · Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right of use assets at the date of initial application. · Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend.

On transition to IFRS 16, the Company recognized right of use assets and lease liabilities. The impact on transition is summarized below:

Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity date at the date of acquisition of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. Money market funds are also included as cash equivalents. The money market funds are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Deposits Deposits consist of cash and cash equivalents which have been placed on deposit with a maturity between 3 and 24 months.

Trade receivables and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently at amortized cost less any impairment loss. The Company applies the expected credit loss model to determine any trade receivables impairment losses. The trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component (in accordance with IFRS 15) and therefore the loss allowance is always measured as equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The Company uses a provisioning matrix to calculate the level of the provision and measures lifetime expected credit losses at percentages of amounts outstanding for current trade receivables, 30 days past due, 60 days past due, 90 days past due and over 120 days past due. The total accounts receivable impairment consists of two elements: provision if and when required based on Company estimates and additional provision as determined by the use of the provision matrix. Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using moving weighted average costs) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and costs to make the sales. Cost includes net prices paid for materials purchased and all expenses to bring the inventory to its current location, charges for freight and custom duties, production labor costs and factory overhead.

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including financing expenses of capital investment projects under construction.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the following estimated useful lives:

Category

Estimated useful life

Land Buildings Leasehold improvements1 Machinery and equipment Office furniture and equipment
1 Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or economic life of the asset.

Not depreciated 15­30 years 10­15 years 2­10 years 3­10 years

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.

The Company recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of

such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefit relating to that subsequent

97

expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. Other costs are recognized in the Consolidated

Statement of Comprehensive Income as expense, as incurred.

Right of use assets

Accounting principles applicable from January 1, 2019

Definition of a lease At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. This policy is applied to contracts entered into, on or after January 1, 2019.

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price.

Right of use assets The Company recognizes right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The right of use asset are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets (see accounting policy for property, plant and equipment).

In addition, the right of use asset is periodically assessed for impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

Lease liabilities Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities comprise the following: · Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments. · Lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value (i.e. below  5,000). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms of one to five years. The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. It considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.

Accounting principles applicable before January 1, 2019

Assets acquired under financial leases are included in the Statement of Financial Position at the present value of the

minimum future lease payments and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated economic lives.

A corresponding liability is recorded at the inception of the financial lease and the interest element of financial leases is

charged to interest expense. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of

98

Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. All intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Other intangible assets, such as goodwill and intangible assets not yet in use, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually. In cases where the carrying value of the intangibles exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment charge is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Company takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.

The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: · The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus · The recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus · If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less · The net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss.

Capitalized development expenses Expenditures for research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an expense, as incurred. Expenditure for development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the Company has the intention and sufficient resources to complete development, the Company has the ability to use or sell the development and the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the development during its process.

The expenditure capitalized includes the cost of materials, direct labor and other directly attributable costs. Other development expenditures are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an expense, as incurred. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Capitalized development expenditures are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

Other identifiable intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost (i.e. fair value of the consideration given) at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

Amortization Amortization is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Amortization of capitalized development expenses and other intangible assets commence from the date they are available for use.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Category

Estimated useful life

Software Development expenses

3­5 years 3­7 years

The Company does not have any other intangible assets with indefinite lives.

The amortization is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.

Impairment of non-financial assets

99

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets are reviewed at each year's end balance sheet date to

determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is

estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at

each balance sheet date.

An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis.

Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of other assets is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

100

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Reversals of impairment An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Other non-current assets Funds with insurance companies for pension liability are stated at fair value.
Other current liabilities Other current liabilities consist of notes payable to banks, trade payables and other payables and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets recognition and derecognition With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized when: · The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. · The Company retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full
without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement. · The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (i) has transferred substantially
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. · When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognized on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost; Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ("FVOCI") ­ debt investment; FVOCI ­ equity investment; or Fair Value through Profit and Loss ("FVTPL"). Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: · It is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and · Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: · It is held within business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling
financial assets; and · Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investmentby-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

Business model assessment The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice, how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company's management, the risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed, how managers of the business are compensated and the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, "principal" is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. "Interest" is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.

Subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial assets at FVTPL: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortized cost: These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss. Debt investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. Equity investments at FVOCI: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

Impairment of financial assets

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Impairment The Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses ("ECLs") on the following: · Financial assets measured at amortized cost; · Debt investments measured at FVOCI; and · Contract assets.

The Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, expect for debt securities that are determined

to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk has not

increased significantly since initial recognition, which are measured at 12-month ECLs. 12-month ECLs are the portion of

ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting

date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognized are referred to as "Stage 1 financial instruments". Life-

time ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.

Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognized but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as "Stage 2

101

financial instruments".

Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at equal to lifetime expected credit losses. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.

Measurement of ECLs ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is "credit-impaired" when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in OCI.

Write-off The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Company individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In line with its hedging strategy, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to operational activities denominated in foreign currencies. In accordance with its treasury and risk policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company uses hedge accounting. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.

The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in financial income (expense). Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

The Company applies the cash flow hedge accounting model. In this hedging model, the effective part of a hedge transaction is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, which is reclassified to earnings in the same period(s) in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective part of the hedge is recognized directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in financial income (expense).

Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings and compound financial instruments, such as Convertible Notes.

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Compound financial instruments issued by the Company comprise Convertible Notes denominated in euro that can be

102

converted to share capital at the option of the holder, when the number of shares to be issued is fixed and does not vary

with changes in fair value. The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially at the fair

value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognized initially at

the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability

component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion

to their initial carrying amounts. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial

instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound

financial instrument is not remeasured. Interest related to the financial liability is recognized in profit or loss. On

conversion, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognized.

Provisions A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Warranties A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.

Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly and is irrevocable. Future operating costs are not provided for.

Revenue recognition

Significant accounting policy revenue Revenue is measured on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a product of service to a customer.

Nature of goods and services The following is a description of principal activities - aggregated into a single reporting segment, the semiconductor's back-end segment - from which the Company generates its revenue.

The main portion of our revenue is derived from contractual arrangements that have multiple deliverables. The Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are a distinct performance obligation ­ i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in the arrangement based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The relative stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the list prices for products and services that are sold separately or based on the expected costs plus a margin approach. For products and services that are not sold separately, the Company estimates relative stand-alone selling prices using the expected costs plus margin approach.

Products and services

Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and significant payment terms

Machines

After successful internal buy-off, machines are shipped to customers at the following

Conversion kits and upgrades

shipping terms:

· Ex Works: the customer takes control once the machine leaves the Besi premises

and the customer pays for shipping and handling activities.

· Free on Board: the customer takes control once the machine is delivered to the

carrier (on to the ship in case of sea or to airport in case of air freight) and Besi pays

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

for the shipping and handling activities until the hand-over to the sea or air carrier.

· Delivery at Place: the customer takes control once the machine arrives at the

customers' premises and Besi pays for the shipping and handling activities.

· Revenue is recognized when the customer takes control of the shipped item.

· Regular payment terms vary between 30 and 90 days after date of delivery.

Installation, start-up and

These services are separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized at the

training services

moment of performance of these services. Regular payment terms vary between 30

and 90 days after date of delivery.

Spare parts

Revenue of spare parts is recognized upon shipment to the customer, based on the

applicable shipment terms (refer to above). Regular payment terms vary between 30

and 90 days after date of delivery.

Extended warranty

Extended warranty is considered a separate performance obligation under IFRS 15.

Revenue for Extended Warranty for a warranty term in excess of the standard warranty

term is deferred and recognized over the term of the extended warranty period.

103

Extended warranty, if any, is sold as part of the machine contract.

Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets are recognized according to the Company's rights to consideration for the fulfilled but not yet invoiced performance obligations at the reported date. Contract liabilities are recognized when advanced consideration is received from a customer or when the Company has outstanding performance obligations relating to warranties and installation.

The Company applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121 and does not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.

Segment reporting

Operating segments The Company is engaged in one line of business, the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service of semiconductor assembly equipment for the global semiconductor and electronics industries. The Company identifies three operating segments (Product Groups). These Product Groups are Die Attach, Packaging and Plating. The chief operating decision maker reviews each Product Group in detail and all operational functions are allocated to these Product Groups: 1) Product Marketing, 2) Research and Development, 3) Product Group management, 4) Customer Project management and 5) Operations. Corporate functions (Finance, Legal, Human Resources and Sales & Service) do not qualify as operating segments. Hence, Besi identifies three operating segments which meet the IFRS 8 criteria.

Reportable segment IFRS 8 allows for operating segments to be aggregated into reportable segments if the operating segments share similar economic characteristics. The Company deems the three operating segments to meet the aggregation criteria, as the nature of the products and services, production processes, classes of customer and methods used to distribute the products and provide services and gross margins are similar. Hence the three Product Groups are aggregated into a single reporting segment; the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service of assembly equipment for the semiconductor's back-end segment. The basis for aggregation is explained directly below and as the Company has only one reporting segment all financial segment information can be found in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Indicators for aggregation into single reporting segment The similarity of economic characteristics can be evaluated based on future prospects. Within the semiconductor backend segment the market information is based on VLSI Research, a leading independent industry analyst, forecasts. Industry trends are captured in these forecasts and always used as a source when referring to the future developments (e.g. press releases). Demand for semiconductor devices and expenditures for the equipment required to assemble semiconductors is cyclical, depending in large part on levels of demand worldwide for computing and peripheral equipment, telecommunications devices and automotive and industrial components as well as the production capacity of global semiconductor manufacturers. All operating segments move up or down in the same response to the same positive and negative factors like general economic upturns and downturns, changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.

The nature of products and services within the Besi group is very much the same, all captured in the semiconductor backend industry and served by one service organization, which is designing and supporting that equipment.

Furthermore, all production processes are organized as manufacturing and assembly of projects and are mainly produced in our Asian production facilities in Malaysia and China. This means that the production of the different Product Groups shares the same facilities, employees and processes. Also, similar materials are used to produce the systems.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The evaluation of the type or class of customer for products and services leads to the conclusion that the risk exposure profile of the customers is similar because of the fact that all customers are leading US, European and Asian semiconductor manufacturers and assembly subcontractors which in their turn depend on the global market conditions.

One worldwide responsible person for Sales & Customer Support, indicates the centralization of the Sales organization and the method used to distribute our products. The Besi name is used throughout the global operations and the Besi logo has been adopted to be used by all Product Groups. As from January 1, 2013, legal entity names have been changed, amongst others, to put more emphasis on this uniformed global operating, like Besi Austria GmbH, Besi Switzerland AG and Besi Netherlands B.V.

Furthermore, in order to assess performance and to make resource allocation decisions based on sufficient detailed

104

information, the chief operating decision maker must have financial information which covers all of the Product Groups,

including corporate functions, meaning full Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, the total external financing

of the Besi group is evaluated on consolidated level and not split into business operations.

Accordingly, all information consolidated is the reportable segment under IFRS 8, reported in the semiconductor back-end industry.

Employee benefits

Pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

The Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability (asset).

The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions paid to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Company. An economic benefit is available to the Company if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.

Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Company recognizes them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

A majority of the Company's Dutch employees participate in a pension plan operated by an industry-wide pension fund, which classifies as a defined contribution plan under IAS 19.

Severance provisions A provision for severance obligations is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position if the Company is obligated to severance payments, even if future termination of the contract is initiated by the employee. For some of our subsidiaries this is mandatory by law.

Share-based payments In 2016, the Company adopted the Remuneration Policy 2017-2019 which is mainly a prolongation of the Remuneration Policy 2011-2016 which contains specific conditions for the performance shares awarded to the Board of Management. The Company established the BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. Long-Term Incentive plan for the Board of Management and other employees (the "2014 and the 2017 Framework Incentive Plan"). For more details, reference is made to Note 25.

The grant date fair value of the performance shares granted to Board Members and key employees is measured taking into account the impact of any market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance conditions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The grant date fair value of the equity-settled share-based payment awards is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period between the grant date and the vesting date of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service condition and any nonmarket performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

Subsidies and other governmental credits Subsidies and other governmental credits to cover research and development costs relating to approved projects are recorded as research and development credits in the period when the research and development costs to which such subsidy or credit relates occurs. If the related development costs are capitalized, the subsidies and other governmental credits will be offset against capitalization.

Net financing expenses and borrowing costs

Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, foreign

exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognized in the Consolidated Statement

of Comprehensive Income. Interest income is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it

105

accrues, using the effective interest method. The interest expense component of lease payments is recognized in the

Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition or

production of a qualifying asset are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective

interest method.

Income taxes The Company applies the liability method of accounting for taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enactment tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future.

Judgements In the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements:

Impairment of non-financial assets The Company assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value-in-use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further details are contained in Notes 9, 10 and 11.

Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Further details are contained in Note 29.

Pension and other post-employment benefits The costs of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment medical benefits are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Further details are given in Note 25.

Development costs Development costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy as reflected before. Initial capitalization of costs is based on management judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. Further details are contained in Note 11.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Inventory obsolescence Provisions for obsolete inventories are recognized for inventories which are deemed obsolete. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount which is considered obsolete. Further details are contained in Note 6.

New IFRS standards and interpretations

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on

or after January 1, 2020. However, the Company expects no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The Company annually carries out impairment tests on capitalized goodwill, based on the cash-generating units.

The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill with indefinite lives allocated to each cash-generating unit are as follows:

Die Attach Plating Total

43,308 1,981
45,289

43,118 1,981
45,099

The value-in-use of the cash-generating units subject to impairment testing is calculated based on the discounted cash flow method. The value-in-use calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on the budget for the year 2020 and financial projections per Product Group approved by management for the projection period (2021-2024).

The key assumptions used by management underlying the value-in-use calculation per cash-generating unit are as follows:

Cash flows per cash-generating unit for the five-year projection period are based on: · The Company's budget for 2020. · Revenue forecasts for 2021-2024 as per market growth estimates from VLSI Research, a leading independent analyst for
the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, and the Company's estimated market shares. · Bottom-up estimates for gross profit, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses as
per management's strategic planning. · A pre-tax discount rate of 9.9% (Die Attach) to 10.2% (Plating) representing the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) is determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (in 2018 a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% (Die Attach) and 11.4% (Plating)). · Residual value is based on a 1.0% perpetual growth rate (in 2018: 1.0%). · The risk free rate of 0.3% (in 2018: 1.0%) and equity risk premium of 5.8% (in 2018: 5.5%).

All assumptions used reflect the current market assessment and are based on published indices and management estimates which are challenged by a third party financial advisor. Based on this analysis, management believes that the value-in-use of the cash-generating units subject to impairment testing substantially exceeded their carrying values and that, therefore, goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2019.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The outcome of a sensitivity analysis was that reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions of 100 basis points (lower revenue growth rates and higher discount rates respectively) would not result in other conclusions for the impairment test performed.

19. Leases The Company has lease contracts for various facilities and other equipment used in its operations. Leases of facilities generally have lease terms between 1 and 10 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment generally have lease terms between 1 and 4 years. The Company's obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor's title to the leased assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension options. These options are negotiated by management to provide flexibility in managing the leased-asset portfolio and align with the Company's business needs. Management exercises significant judgement in determining whether these extension options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also has certain leases of machinery and offices with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with low value. The Company applies the `short-term lease' and `lease of low-value assets' recognition exemptions for these leases.

Share-based payments Remuneration Policy 2017-2019 In 2016, the Company adopted the Remuneration Policy 2017-2019, which is mainly a prolongation of the Remuneration Policy 2011-2016. The total number of ordinary shares that will be awarded may not exceed 1.5% of the total number of outstanding shares at December 31 of the year prior to the year in which the award is made.

At the Annual General Meeting in 2018, shareholders approved a proposal whereby each Besi ordinary share is split into two ordinary shares with a simultaneous increase in the number of total ordinary shares authorized from 160 million to 320 million. Shareholders of record at the close of business on May 7, 2018 were eligible for the stock split. For comparative purposes, the award numbers prior to the stock split have been multiplied by two and the share prices and fair values prior to the stock split have been divided by two in this share-based payment note.

Under the Remuneration Policy 2017-2019, the Supervisory Board may, at its own discretion and upon recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, award additional shares to a member of the Board of Management as a reward for extraordinary achievements of excellent performance, up to a maximum of 60,000 shares (120,000 shares following the two for one stock split in May 2018). For the performance year 2019, the Supervisory Board at its own discretion and upon recommendation by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, awarded the member of the Board of Management 120,000 shares on a split-adjusted basis, which vested on January 17, 2019.

2014 and 2017 Framework Incentive Plan The performance shares awarded as from 2014 to the member of the Board of Management and other employees under the 2014 and the 2017 Framework Incentive Plan will vest at the end of the three-year performance period, depending on the actual performance of the Company. If at target performance is achieved, 100% of the performance shares awarded will vest. The maximum number of shares that can vest amounts to 150% of the target number of performance shares conditionally awarded.

After the three-year performance period the actual number of performance shares that vests, subject to continued employment, will be determined based on: · Net Income relative to Revenue (NIR) over a three-year performance period (50%). · The Company's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") relative to that of the TSR peer group consisting of 19 peer companies
operating in the semiconductor industry (50%).

Upto and including 2019, Besi's Swiss operations had a mixed company status on Cantonal and Communal level. Effective January 1, 2020, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financial ("Swiss Tax Reform") becomes effective, abolishing the current privileged corporate tax regimes. Upon transition, the Company has decided to use the current law step up method, which creates tax free reserves. These tax free reserves can be depreciated against taxable income on Cantonal and Communal level for a period of five years (years 2020 upto 2024) and to a maximum of 70% of the taxable income. Based on the available tax free reserves and the profit projections for the Company's Swiss operations, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of  11.6 million in 2019. In addition, an amount of  20.8 million related to the Swiss Tax Reform is not recognized, as the Company does not expect to utilize these tax credits within five years.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The deferred tax assets for operating losses carry forward are related to the US, Dutch and Austrian operations of the Company. In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.

The US carry forwards amount to  13.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and expire during the period of 2022 and thereafter. Based on actual results realized in 2019 and projection for the US operations, a valuation allowance of  1.5 million has been recorded in 2019. The net deferred tax asset related to the US carry forward amounts to  1.2 million and is expected to be fully recovered.

The Dutch carry forwards relating to operating losses amount to  7.0 million and expire during the periods of 2020 and 2021. In 2019, the Dutch Government revised the statutory tax rate as follows: for 2020 a tax rate of 25% still applies, from 2021 onwards the tax rate is reduced to 21.7%.

Under the Dutch innovation box regime, qualifying income that results from endeavours in the field of R&D is taxed at an effective Dutch corporation tax rate of 7%. In 2019, the Company has been granted the Dutch innovation box regime, effective January 1, 2015. Upon final agreement, the Company recognized a tax benefit of  5.1 million, of which  4.8 million was reported in 2018 and the remainder of  0.3 million in 2019.

There are no income tax consequences attached to the proposed payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

Tax risk Given the international business structure of the Company and the increasing number and amounts of intercompany transactions and the internationally growing attention for tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS"), certain tax risks hereto may exist. The Company does not pay taxes or make use of tax structures in countries where the Company has no economic activities.

Description of uncertain tax positions Following a tax audit in Malaysia, the Company was by law obliged to pay additional income taxes of  0.4 million relating to transfer pricing adjustments. However, based on the relevant facts and circumstances whereas the Company has followed OECD practices and guidelines for the transfer pricing, management has assessed that it is probable that the claim will be reversed or refused by court. Hence, no provision to reflect this uncertainty is recorded in the financial statements.

30. Earnings per share The following table reconciles ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the year to average shares outstanding used to compute income per share. The share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted for the two for one stock split effected in May 2018.

31. Financial instruments, financial risk management objectives and policies

Fair value of financial instruments The Company assumes that the book value of the Company's financial instruments, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, deposits, trade receivables and accounts payable, does not significantly differ from their fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments and to the fact that interest rates are floating or approximate the rates currently available to the Company. For the valuation of the Convertible Notes reference is made to Note 18.

The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are
observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based
on observable market data.

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, are as follows:

There were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

The only recurring fair value measurement is the valuation of forward exchange contracts for hedging purposes. According to IFRS 13 this measurement is categorized as Level 2. Money market funds are part of our cash and cash equivalents and therefore categorized as level 1. Non-recurring fair value measurements were not applicable in the reporting period.

Financial risk management objectives and policies

Risk management framework The Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks, such as foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. These risks are inherent to the way the Company operates as a multinational with a number of local operating companies.

The Company's overall risk management policy is established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to risk limits. Risk management policies and systems are managed at central level and reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities.

All material findings that result from the use of the Company's risk management policy are discussed with our Audit Committee and Supervisory Board.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

The Company, through its training, management standards and procedures, such as guidelines and instructions governing hedging of financial risks, developed a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. In addition, the Company performs several reviews at all significant operating companies, such as reviews of the foreign currency positions. The Company's policies, specifically regarding to foreign currency hedging, interest rate, credit, market and liquidity risks, are further described in the remainder of this Note.

Foreign exchange Due to the international scope of the Company's operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in the value of the euro, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Chinese yuan against the US dollar and US dollar-linked currencies, since approximately 68% of its sales in 2019 (2018: approximately 67%) are denominated in US dollar. Furthermore, due to the Company's ongoing transfer of the supply chain to Asia, the Company is increasingly exposed to fluctuations of the Malaysian ringgit, Chinese yuan and Singapore dollar against the euro and US dollar.

130

The Company seeks to protect itself from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates by hedging firmly

committed sales contracts, which are denominated in foreign currencies through the use of forward foreign currency

exchange contracts. In addition, the Company also uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge balance

sheet positions that are denominated in a foreign currency. During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any derivative

financial instruments that were held for trading or speculative purposes. Furthermore, the Company does not use financial

instruments to hedge the translation risk related to equity, intercompany loans of a permanent nature and earnings of

foreign subsidiaries. The Company has adopted the cash flow hedge model in line with IFRS 9. In this hedging model, the

effective part of a hedge transaction is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, which is reclassified to

earnings in the same period(s) in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Due to cash flow hedge transactions,  541 was reported as other comprehensive income at December 31, 2019. The amount in 2019 released from equity in revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was  238. The cash flow hedging reserve included in equity comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedges related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. The ineffective part of the hedges recognized, directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was a loss of  488 in 2019 and a loss of  1,082 in 2018.

The Company has exposure to credit risk to the extent that the counterparty to the transaction fails to perform according to the term of the contract. The amount of such credit risk, measured as the fair value of all forward foreign currency exchange contracts that have a positive fair value position, was  1,396 and  2,143 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company believes that the risk of significant loss from credit risk is remote, because it deals with creditworthy financial institutions. The Company does not, in the normal course of business, demand collateral from the counterparties.

The Company's principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise of bank loans and overdrafts, Convertible Notes, financial leases and trade payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company's operations. The Company has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.

The Company enters into derivative transactions exclusively with forward currency contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the currency risks arising from the Company's operations.

The Company's policy is, and has been throughout 2019 and 2018, that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

Foreign currency risk As a consequence of the global nature of Besi's businesses, its operations, reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other major world currencies. Currency exchange rate movements typically also affect economic growth, inflation, interest rates, government actions and other factors. These changes can cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.

The discussion below of changes in currency exchange rates does not incorporate these other economic factors. For example, the sensitivity analysis presented in the foreign exchange rate risk discussion below does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category. As currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of Besi's international business into euro affects year-over-year comparability.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Besi's currency risk exposure primarily occurs because the Company generates a portion of its revenue in currencies other than the euro while the major share of the corresponding cost of sales is incurred in euro, Swiss franc, Malaysian ringgit and Chinese yuan. The percentage of its consolidated net revenue which is presented by US dollar or US dollar-linked currencies amounted to approximately 68% and 67% of total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, whereas revenue denominated in euro amounted to approximately 32% in 2019. Approximately 33% of its costs and expenses were denominated in euro, 10% in Swiss franc, 25% in Malaysian ringgit, 11% in Chinese yuan and the remaining 21% in various currencies. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, Besi continually assesses its remaining exposure to currency risks and hedges such risks through the use of derivative financial instruments. The principal derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company to cover foreign currency exposures are forward foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify for hedge accounting.

132

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis of the Company`s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of

monetary assets and liabilities) and the Company's equity (due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts)

related to reasonable potential changes in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the euro, Swiss franc and Malaysian

ringgit, with all other variables held constant. This comparison is done as most transactions are in US dollar and are

hedged against the local currencies of the main operations in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Malaysia. The analysis

includes the effects of fair value changes of the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures and focuses

only on balance sheet positions.

The current outstanding forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.

Interest rate risk The Company has interest-bearing assets and liabilities exposing it to fluctuations in market interest rates. The Company is hardly exposed to the risk of changes in market interest rates through borrowing activities due to very limited debt with floating interest rates. Given the Company's cash position, fluctuations in market interest rates are affecting the Company's results. An increase of interest rates will have a positive effect, while a decrease of market interest rates will negatively impact the Company's results. No derivative interest rate related swaps have been entered into for trading or speculative purposes or to manage interest exposures.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and from its financing activities for cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments. With its treasury and cash investment policies the Company manages exposure to credit risks on an ongoing basis including monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties. The Company does not anticipate on non-performance by counterparties given their high creditworthiness expressed in good credit rates.

The Company's maximum exposure to credit risk for financial instruments are the carrying amounts of financial assets as illustrated in the table at the beginning of Note 31. The Company does not hold collateral as security.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Cash and cash equivalents The Company is managing the credit risk from balances with banks and cash equivalents in accordance with the Company's cash investment policy. In addition to preserving the principal amount main objectives of this policy are maintaining appropriate liquidity for business operations, diversifying cash investments to minimize risk from inappropriate investments and concentrating the Company's cash at the highest level, i.e. BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. Diversification is aimed by distributing the cash and cash equivalents over at least five counterparties including money market funds. Cash pool arrangements based on zero-balancing are in place to concentrate cash enabling BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. to fulfil the role of internal bank.

The Company invests cash and cash equivalents in (short-term) deposits with financial institutions that have good credit ratings and in triple A money market funds that invest in highly rated short-term debt securities of governments, financial institutions and corporates. These investments are readily convertible to a known amount in cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade receivables and other receivables

The Company has established a credit policy under which credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring

133

credit over specified thresholds. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics

of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the

default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.

As the Company's revenue is generated by shipments to Asian manufacturing operations of leading US, European and

Asian semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors, an industry and geographical concentration of credit risk exists,

however, this risk is reduced through the long-term relationships with its customers.

Expected credit loss assessment The Company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses ("ECLs"). ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. In addition, the Company has, as an addition (sensitivity) analysis compared the outcome based on historical losses with the credit ratings of its largest individual customers.

Based on the above, an amount of  100 of impairment has been recognized on trade receivables and contract assets as per December 31, 2019.

Forward exchange contracts The forward exchange contracts are with multiple counterparties that have high credit ratings. Currently, the Company does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. The Company buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's liquidity needs are affected by many factors including uncertainties of the global economy and the semiconductor industry resulting in fluctuating cash requirements. The Company believes that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its current liabilities including expected capital expenditures and repayment obligations in 2019. The Company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing cash flows of all entities throughout the year. The Company intends to return cash to the shareholders on a regular basis in the form of dividend payments and, subject to actual and anticipated liquidity requirements and other relevant factors, share buybacks.

Capital management The primary objective of the Company's capital management is to ensure healthy capital ratios, with focus on liquidity and financial stability throughout the industry cycles, in order to support its business and maximize shareholder value.

The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may make a dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Company only regards equity as capital. This capital is managed using solvency ratio (excluding intangible assets) and return on investment.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements

1. Summary of significant accounting policies The Financial Statements of the parent company have been prepared using the option of article 362.8 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, meaning that the accounting principles used are the same as for the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign currency amounts have been translated, assets and liabilities have been valued, and net income has been determined, in accordance with the principles of valuation and determination of income presented in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsidiaries of the parent company are accounted for using the net equity value. The net equity value is determined on the basis of IFRS accounting principles applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In case of a negative net equity value of a subsidiary, the negative value is deducted from the loan due from the respective subsidiary.

In addition, the Company will apply the option provided under RJ 100.107a to eliminate the impact of IFRS 9 on intercompany receivables and payables in the parent company financial statements against their book value of these receivables and payables in order to have no impact on the reconciliation between the consolidated equity and company equity position.

The remuneration paragraph is included in Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reference is also made to the Remuneration Report included in this Annual Report.

The negative equity adjustments in the movement schedule are adjustments of the income for the period related to the net income of the subsidiaries with a negative equity value.

Loans due from/to subsidiaries Interest on loans from/to subsidiaries is calculated based on monthly base rates plus a market-conform mark-up. An amount of  20.2 million relates to loans granted by BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. to its US subsidiaries. These loans are repaid upon lenders' demand for repayment. Therefore, no interest is calculated on these loans.

For an overview of all subsidiaries, reference is made to "Principals of consolidation" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

5. Shareholder's equity At the AGM of April 26, 2018, the General Meeting of Shareholders approved a stock split of the Company's shares whereby each issued ordinary share was split into two shares.

Preference shares At the AGM of April 26, 2018, the General Meeting of Shareholders approved a stock split of the Company's shares whereby each issued ordinary share was split into two shares. After the effectuation of this stock split in May 2018, Besi's authorized share capital consists of 160,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value  0.01 per share, and 160,000,000 preference shares, nominal value  0.01 per share.

No preference shares were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

In April 2000, the foundation "Stichting Continuïteit BE Semiconductor Industries" (the "Foundation") was established. The Foundation is an independent legal entity and is not owned or controlled by any other legal person. The purpose of the Foundation is to safeguard the interests of the Company, the enterprise connected therewith and all the parties having an interest therein and to exclude as much as possible influences which could threaten, among other things, the continuity, independence and identity of the Company contrary to such interests. The aim of the preference shares is, among other things, to provide a protective measure against unfriendly take-over bids and other possible unsolicited influences which could threaten the Company's continuity, independence and identity. The issue of preference shares would enable the Company to consider its position in the then-existing circumstances.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2019

By agreement of May 19, 2008, between the Company and the Foundation, which replaces a similar agreement dated April 19, 2002, the Foundation has been granted a call option pursuant to which it may purchase a number of preference shares up to a maximum of the number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding at the time of exercise of this option, minus one.

The Company has also granted to the Foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and conduct of business of the Company with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer). The Company believes that this may be a useful option in the period before the issuance of preference shares, without causing a dilution of the rights of other shareholders at that stage.

Foreign currency translation adjustment The foreign currency translation adjustment comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.

Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report".

OTHER INFORMATION

We are independent of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the "Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties" (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the "Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten" (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the "Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants" (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).  We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our audit approach

Our understanding of the business

BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. is the holding company for a worldwide business engaged in the development, production,

marketing and sales of back-end equipment for the semiconductor industry. The group is structured in components and

145

we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the

operations of the group and our risk assessment.

We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks, and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Materiality

Materiality Benchmark applied Explanation

 5,600,000 (2018:  7,500,000) Around 7% of profit before tax Based on our professional judgement we have considered an earnings-based measure as the appropriate basis to determine materiality. We consider profit before tax to be the most relevant measure given the nature of the business and the users of the financial statements. Due to the cyclicity in the semiconductor industry and subsequent lower results in 2019 compared to 2018, we have used a higher percentage (2019: 7%, 2018: 5%) to determine our materiality.

We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.

We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of  280,000, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations

Our responsibility Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the Company that may have a material effect on the financial statements.

Our audit response related to fraud risks In order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal control. We do not audit internal control per se for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.

We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors and the Supervisory Board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption.

We evaluated the design and the implementation of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important judgement areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in Note 2 in the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries.

OTHER INFORMATION

We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on our audit procedures.

Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations

We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected

to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through discussions with

146

the Board of Management, reading minutes, inspection of internal compliance reports, and performing substantive tests

of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.

We also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.

Going concern In order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, we consider based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Scope of the group audit BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.

Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities in Austria, China, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore and Switzerland. We have: · Performed audit procedures ourselves at the group entities located in the Netherlands, on the key audit matters revenue
recognition and valuation of goodwill and certain centralized accounts. · Used the work of other EY auditors when auditing the group entities in Europe and Asia. · Performed review procedures or specific audit procedures at other group entities.

In total these procedures resulted in the following coverage:

PRE-TAX INCOME

EXTERNAL REVENUES

ASSETS

5% 24%

1% 28%

2% 18%

Full scope

71%

By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER INFORMATION

Teaming and use of specialists We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the semiconductor industry. We included specialists in the areas of valuation, IT audit, share based payments, income tax and corruption and bribery.

General audit procedures

Our audit further included among others:

· Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

· Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related

disclosures made by management.

147

· Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures.

· Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves

fair presentation.

Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.

Following the changes in tax legislation in Switzerland, a new key audit matter has been defined related to the valuation of the related deferred tax asset.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

OTHER INFORMATION

Revenue recognition

Risk

Our audit response

Due to the nature of the Company's industry the Company enters into various customer contracts and revenue arrangements which may include a combination of multiple performance obligations and can include different shipping terms.
We identified the following risks related to improper revenue recognition and management override for the Company: 1. Machines sales revenue could be recorded
in the incorrect year (cut-off). 2. Recognition of other performance obligations
(e.g. extended warranty) not in accordance with IFRS 15 (revenue from customer contracts). 3. Posting of manual journal entries in external revenues on management instructions. 4. Issuance of invoices for fictious revenue transactions.
Reference is made to Note 2 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the significant accounting policies on revenue recognition.

We have assessed the appropriateness of the Company's revenue recognition accounting policies and assessed compliance with EU-IFRS accounting policies (IFRS 15).
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, testing individual sales orders and transactions to assess proper identification of the identifiable performance obligations in the contracts and correct allocation of the transaction price to these performance obligations and recognition hereof. We used data analytics to correlate revenues to cash receipts. Furthermore, we tested manual journal entries with supporting evidence. We also selected sales transactions before and after year-end to assess whether revenue was recognized in the correct period by, amongst others, inspection of sales contracts, internal acceptance tests, client acceptance documents and shipping documents.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures provided by the Company in Note 2 and 23.

Observations
We assessed that the Company's revenue recognition accounting policies were appropriately applied and disclosed in Note 2 and 23 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, we assessed that the revenues were recorded in the correct year (cut-off) and that no invoices were issued for fictious sales transactions.

Valuation of goodwill
Risk
The Company's goodwill of  45.3 million is allocated to two cash generating units, Die Attach ( 43.3 million) and Plating ( 2.0 million) at December 31, 2019. The annual goodwill impairment test for the Die Attach cash generating unit is a key audit matter because the amount is material and the assessment process is judgemental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market and economic conditions.
Considering the downturn of the semiconductor industry and the declined performance of the Company during 2019, we considered the valuation of goodwill as a key audit matter.
Reference is made to Note 10 for the disclosure related to goodwill.

Our audit response
We assessed and challenged management's assumptions used in the impairment model as outlined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, amongst others, the discount rate used, relevant allocations, forecasted cash flows and growth rates.
For the financial forecast after 2020, the Company used assumptions in respect of market growth estimates from semiconductor equipment industry reports.
We have evaluated the historical accuracy of management's estimates that drive the assessment, such as business plans and expected growth rates. In our audit we were assisted by our valuation experts.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures provided by the Company in Note 10 in relation to its impairment assessment.

Observations
We assessed that the Company's goodwill impairment analysis was performed in accordance with EU-IFRS accounting policies (IAS 36) and adequate disclosed in Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation of deferred tax asset (Swiss tax reform)

Risk

Our audit response

Effective January 1, 2020, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financial (Swiss Tax Reform) becomes effective in Switzerland, abolishing the current privileged corporate tax regimes. Upon transition, the Company has decided to use the current law step up method, which creates tax free reserves. The amortization of these tax free reserves can be offset against future taxable Income on Cantonal and Communal level for a period of five years (years 2020 up to and including 2024) and to a maximum of 70% of the taxable income. Based on the available tax free reserves and the profit projections for the Company's Swiss operations, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of  11.6 million in 2019. Comprising of a gross amount of  32.4 million and a recorded valuation allowance of  20.8 million, as the Company does not expect to utilize the full tax credits within the coming five years. The recognition of this deferred tax asset is considered a key audit matter as the amount is material and the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is based on forward looking assumptions that may be affected by future market and economic conditions.

Our audit procedures included the use of tax specialists in Switzerland to assess the new tax legislation and evaluating the underlying tax calculations of the Company. We have evaluated the Company's assumptions and estimates in relation to the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income based on budgets and strategic business plans, principally by performing sensitivity analyses and evaluating and testing the key assumptions used to determine the amounts recognized.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures provided by the Company in Note 29 in relation to income taxes.

Reference is made to Note 29 for the disclosure related to income taxes.

Observations
We assessed that the Company's tax accounting policies were appropriately applied in accordance with the EU-IFRS accounting policies (IAS 12 and IFRIC 23) and adequate disclosed in Note 29 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We concur with management that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to use.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Engagement We were engaged as auditor of BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. as of the audit for the year 2018 and have operated as statutory auditor since the appointment in the AGM of 26 April 2018.

No prohibited non-audit services We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.

Description of responsibilities for the financial statements

Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EUIFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.  Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

OTHER INFORMATION

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit approach section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.

Communication We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit.

In this respect we also submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation

150

on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional

report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.

We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Other Information
Preference shares At December 31, 2019, the Company's authorized capital consisted of 160,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value  0.01 per share, and 160,000,000 preference shares, nominal value  0.01 per share.
No preference shares were outstanding at December 31, 2019.
In April 2000, the foundation "Stichting Continuïteit BE Semiconductor Industries" (the "Foundation") was established. The Foundation is an independent legal entity and is not owned or controlled by any other legal person. The purpose of the Foundation is to safeguard the interests of the Company, the enterprise connected therewith and all the parties having an interest therein and to exclude as much as possible influences which could threaten, among other things, the continuity, independence and identity of the Company. The aim of the preference shares is, among other things, to provide a protective measure against unfriendly take-over bids and other possible unsolicited influences which could threaten the Company`s continuity, independence and identity, including, but not limited to, a proposed resolution to dismiss the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management. The issue of preference shares would enable the Company to consider its position in the then-existing circumstances.
By agreement of May 19, 2008 between the Company and the Foundation, which replaced a similar agreement dated April 19, 2002, the Foundation has been granted a call option pursuant to which it may purchase a number of preference shares up to a maximum of the number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding at the time of exercise of this option, minus one.
The Company has also granted to the Foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and conduct of the business of the Company with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer). The Company believes that this may be a useful option in the period before the issuance of preference shares, without causing a dilution of the rights of other shareholders at that stage.
The members of the board of the Foundation are W.L.J. Bröcker (Chairman), J.N. de Blécourt, F. van Hout and T. de Waard. Except for Mr De Waard who is a former Supervisory Board member, none of the members of the board of the Foundation are connected to the Company. The Foundation therefore qualifies as an independent legal entity within the meaning of section 5:71 paragraph 1 sub c of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).
Appropriation of the result The Articles of Association provide that the Company can only distribute profits from its free distributable reserves. The Board of Management, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, will propose to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to determine the total dividend over 2019 at  1.01 per ordinary share, amounting to a total of  72.9 million. The Board of Management proposes to allocate the part of the net income for the year 2019 remaining after payment of the dividend to the retained earnings. The Supervisory Board has approved this proposal.
The General Meeting of Shareholders approved the 2018 statutory financial statements on April 26, 2019.
