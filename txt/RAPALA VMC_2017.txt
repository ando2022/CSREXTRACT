MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Trading conditions were challenging throughout the year, particularly during the first half. Especially in the US, consumers are increasingly shifting to digital sales channels, which is disrupting the traditional retail channels. The turmoil had a negative impact on the Group's sales in North America as two major customers entered Chapter 11. However, the Group has been able to shift lost business to other customers in the marketplace.
In Europe, cold spring and late start of the summer impacted negatively the main fishing season. In addition, the increased price competition in Europe led to underperformance of certain product categories.

BUSINESS REVIEW The Group's net sales for the year were 3% below last year. Changes in translation exchange rates had a minor negative impact on sales.
North America With comparable exchange rates, sales were at last year's level in North America. The weakened US dollar, however, pulled the sales below last year. The ongoing changes in the US retail landscape, where e-commerce is taking market share from the traditional retail

business, caused turmoil during the year. The Group expects to have kept its market share in the US market as the whole fishing tackle business is hit by the same challenges. Canada contributed positively to the whole region's sales as the full year sales grew well above last year's level. The fourth quarter sales in North America were below last year partly driven by early deliveries of certain winter fishing products in the third quarter.
Nordic In the Nordic countries, full year sales were slightly below the level of last year. During the second half of the year, sales recovered well from the first half drop caused by lower hunting sales in Denmark and unfavorable weather conditions in Finland, and the whole region's sales in the second half exceeded last year's level. The Group's knife factory Marttiini showed strong growth supported by the Finland 100 Anniversary Knife sales. Sweden and Norway were also able to significantly increase sales from last year.
Rest of Europe Full year sales for Rest of Europe were below last year's level. Foreign exchange rates supported the region's sales as the Russian ruble appreciated. Unfortunately, the strengthened ruble did not materialize into higher consumer demand. Sales in the other large market in Europe, France, also lagged last year. Sales in France were affected by generally weak demand of fishing tackle products and, at the same time, tightened competition in the industry. Poland, on the other hand, suffered from product portfolio changes. On a positive note, Spain's and Portugal's sales exceeded last year.
Rest of the World Sales for the region were below last year despite positive development in some of the markets. New hunting and outdoor business and sales to Middle East and North Africa helped South Africa to grow sales. Latin America also contributed positively to the region's sales. On the other hand, Thailand suffered from difficult market conditions, especially during the first half of the year. Sales in Australia were impacted by changes in product portfolio and outsourcing of the warehouse operations, which had a negative impact on sales.

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROFITABILITY Comparable (excluding mark-to-market valuations of operative currency derivatives and other items affecting comparability) operating profit decreased by EUR 7.4 million from last year. The effect of translation exchange rates was slightly positive and with comparable translation exchange rates comparable operating profit was EUR 7.6 million lower than last year. Reported operating profit increased by EUR 1.7 million from last year as the items affecting comparability were lower than last year.
Comparable operating profit margin was 4.5% (7.2) for the year. The decline in profitability was driven by lower sales, operational challenges at the factory in Indonesia and write-downs of account receivables in North America. Despite investments in strategic development areas, which increased fixed costs, Group's overall fixed costs decreased from last year.
Reported operating profit margin was 3.5% (2.8) for the full year. Reported operating profit included loss of mark-to-market valuation of operative currency derivatives of EUR 0.3 million (1.6). Net expenses of other items affecting comparability included in the reported operating profit were EUR 2.3 million (10.0). 2017 items affecting comparability included mainly organizational restructuring expenses and restructuring of the Batam plant in Indonesia. In 2016 items affecting comparability consisted for the most part of inventory write-offs according to renewed Group policy and restructurings.
Total financial (net) expenses were EUR 3.2 million (5.0) for the year. Net interest and other financing expenses were EUR 2.1 million (3.7) and (net) foreign exchange expenses were EUR 1.2 million (1.3). In the second half of the year, the future change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduced Group's deferred tax liability by EUR 0.6 million, with a corresponding deferred tax income in the income statement.
Net profit for the year was above last year's level and earnings per share were 0.05 EUR (-0.08). The share of noncontrolling interest in net profit decreased from last year and totaled EUR 0.0 million (1.0).

SEGMENT REVIEW Group Products With comparable exchange rates, sales of Group Products were slightly below last year's level.
Group fishing product sales were below last year's level driven by lower lure sales in North America as a consequence of the retail turmoil. Carp fishing sales grew clearly from last year following the increased focus and investments on the product category. Winter fishing products benefited from good winter conditions and the sales were higher than last year, especially in the US.
Sales of other group products were up from last year. The sales of hunting products were supported by increased Marttiini Finland 100 Anniversary Knife sales. The sales of winter sports products were also up from last year.
Comparable operating profit for Group Products declined compared to last year. Operating profit was burdened by operational challenges in lure manufacturing and write-downs of account receivables in North America.
Third Party Products The sales of Third Party Products were below last year's level, driven by the loss of a product category in Poland as well as challenging market situation affecting sales especially in Russia and France. Additionally, Third Party hunting products were struggling in Denmark.
Comparable operating profit for Third Party Products was below last year`s level burdened by lower sales and increased competition.

the year. Following the successful issuance of a hybrid bond in 2017, gearing and net interest-bearing debt decreased from last year and equity-to-assets increased from last year's level. Following the higher ratio between net interest bearing debt and reported EBITDA at the end of the year, the Group renegotiated the leverage covenant for the last quarter of 2017. The Group expects to fulfill the requirements of the lenders also at the end of the first quarter of 2018.

FINANCIAL POSITION
Cash flow from operations decreased from last year's record level to historically good level of EUR 19.1 million (26.7) for the year. As a consequence of decreased inventories and timing of trade payables, working capital continued to develop positively and the net change in working capital was EUR -11.6 million (-10.5). The declined profitability, however, pulled cash flow from operations below last year.
Despite lower than anticipated sales, inventories decreased from the end of last year amounting to EUR 92.5 million (102.2). Organic decrease in inventories was EUR 8.0 million, while the rest of the decline is related to changes in translation exchange rates and inventory allowance. The inventory reduction is driven by the ongoing focus on working capital management and various supply chain initiatives.
Net cash used in investing activities was on last year's level amounting to EUR 4.9 million (6.0). Capital expenditure was EUR 6.0 million (8.4), net acquisitions EUR 1.5 million and disposals EUR 0.8 million (2.2). The acquisition was related to South-African subsidiary where the non-controlling interest of the company was acquired. In 2017, the Group received the final installment related to the disposal of the gift business in 2011.
The Group issued a EUR 25 million hybrid bond in May 2017. The bond is treated as equity in the financial statements. It has no maturity but the company may exercise an early redemption option at the earliest on 31 May 2019.
Liquidity position of the Group was good. Undrawn committed long-term credit facilities amounted to EUR 59.9 million at the end of

STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
The Group updated its strategy in February 2017. Following the conclusions of the strategy update, in order to build a solid financial and operational platform for long term growth, the Group's primary focus in the coming years will be on capturing organic growth opportunities in the fishing tackle business. The Group will also take determined actions to improve its profitability, lighten balance sheet and improve operational performance. In longer term, the target is to return to more aggressive growth track and actively seek synergistic growth opportunities also outside the fishing tackle business.
The Group's existing assets and capabilities form the foundation for future strategies, both in short and long term. Future strategies are built upon utilizing and capitalizing the brand portfolio, manufacturing platform, research and development knowledge, as well as the broad distribution network and strong local presence all around the world supporting the sales of Group's own and selected synergistic third party products.
The execution of the updated strategy started on all levels in the Group. Several organic growth projects are ongoing in all businesses utilizing deep market and customer understanding. Special focus has been set to leverage our global innovation power to serve growing product categories and niches within fishing.
Significant focus and resources were allocated to streamline internal supply chains and to develop sales and operations planning to achieve lower group-wide inventories. Additionally, lean projects were ongoing in several factories. Certain production phases were transferred from Finland to Estonia and Russia. One of the key projects for 2018 is to develop the operations at the lure factory in Indonesia and to fix identified challenges.
The Group made investments in group-wide common IT systems to increase efficiencies and enable better end-to-end supply chain and product management. The Group also increased investments towards digital channels in order to exploit these opportunities stronger in the future.
The Group will organize a capital markets day in May 2018 to elaborate the updated strategy and its execution.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
In line with the Group's updated strategy, strengthening and further leveraging the Group's global innovation power is one of the key success factors in the future and key requirement for enhancing the organic growth. By utilizing its unique global market knowledge

combined with R&D, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, the Group will address target markets with new innovative products and concepts and will swiftly respond to market needs.
The Group has reorganized and boosted its lure product development procedure by centralizing the product development know-how and key resources to one location in V‰‰ksy, Finland. The R&D center serves both the European and Asian lure manufacturing units. This has also increased the agility of the product development procedures.
The most important product launch in 2017 was the introduction of the Storm 360 GT soft plastic lure in January 2017, supported with coordinated global marketing campaigns. Rapala Rip Stop hard bait was launched to the US market at the iCAST show in July, aimed mainly at the bass market, the largest target category in the US. The revolutionary Sufix Advance monofilament line with proprietary material technology, was introduced to the trade at EFTTEX in July, winning the Best New Monofilament Line award at the show.
Preparations for the first 2018 new product introductions were finished during the second half of the year 2017, and the Rapala big predator baits, targeted at the European pike and global large predator fishing, were launched with great success in January at the Clermont-Ferrand show in France. Other preparations for new lure and fishing line 2018 launches in the second and third quarter are well under way.

The Group develops the reporting and follow-up on environmental matters.
Environmental, economical and social responsibility issues are

SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK 2017 was a year of market turmoil and structural changes in retail especially in the US. There is still somewhat lower visibility to the North American market due to the structural changes experienced during 2017. However, the Group sees continued healthy consumer demand for its products via old and new channels. In Europe, the price competition in certain product categories has increased and the markets continue to be competitive.
The Group has launched various strategic initiatives to boost organic growth and improve cost and capital efficiency as well as operational performance in the future. These initiatives will continue to trigger some additional expenses and investments in 2018.
The Group expects full year net sales with comparable FX rates to be above last year's level and comparable operating profit (excluding mark-to-market valuations of operative currency derivatives and other items affecting comparability) to exceed EUR 15 million.
PROPOSAL FOR PROFIT DISTRIBUTION The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of 0.04 EUR for 2017 (0.10 EUR) per share is distributed from the Group's distributable equity and remaining distributable funds are carried forward to retained earnings. It is proposed that the dividend is distributed in two equal installments. At December 31, 2017 the distributable equity in Group's parent company totaled EUR 20.1 million.
No material changes have taken place in the Group's financial position after the end of the financial year. The Group's liquidity is good and the view of the Board of Directors is that the distribution of the proposed dividend will not undermine this liquidity.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE Events after the balance sheet date are disclosed in the note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

COMPANY'S BACKGROUND
Rapala VMC Corporation ("company") is a Finnish public limited liability company organized under the laws of Finland, domiciled in Asikkala and listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange since 1998. The parent company Rapala VMC Corporation and its subsidiaries ("the Group") operate in some 40 countries and the company is one of the leading fishing tackle companies in the world.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the accounting period of 12 months from January 1 to December 31, 2017. The Board of Directors of the company has approved these financial statements for publication at its meeting on February 15, 2018. Under Finland's Companies Act, shareholders have the option to accept or reject the financial statements in a meeting of shareholders, which will be held after the publication of the financial statements. The meeting has also the option of changing the financial statements.
A copy of the consolidated financial statements is available at the Group's website www.rapalavmc.com or from M‰kel‰nkatu 91, 00610 Helsinki, Finland.

BASIS FOR PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including IAS and IFRS standards as well as the SIC and IFRIC interpretations in effect on December 31, 2017. The term `IFRS standards' refers to standards and interpretations which are approved and adopted by the European Union (regulation EY 1606/2002) and thus are in force in the Finnish legislation. The Group has not early adopted any new, revised or amended standards or interpretations.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated.

APPLIED NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The Group has adopted the new and amended standards and interpretations that took effect during the financial year 2017 and are relevant to its operations. The changes did not have material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
∑ IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows ≠ Disclosure Initiative (amendment, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January, 1 2017). The amendment requires an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The change will not have

a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
∑ IAS 12 Income Taxes ≠ Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (amendment, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January, 1 2017). The amendment harmonizes the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealized losses for assets recognized at fair value. The change will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS IN 2018≠2020 In 2018 the Group will adopt the following new, revised and amended standards and interpretations, which are relevant to its operations as they become effective. They are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
∑ IFRS 15 establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the customer obtains control of the goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In addition, IFRS 15 requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the entity's contracts with customers, performance obligations in the contracts and significant judgements made.
In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Group finalized the impact evaluation and summarized results of the standard, taken necessary actions for implementation of the standard and prepared documentation before the standard effective date. The Group will start reporting according to IFRS 15 during H1/2018. The standard will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statement, although increasing disclosure requirements.
The Group is in the business of manufacturing, sourcing and distributing of mainly fishing tackle equipment as well as hunting, outdoor and winter sports equipment. Contract terms for sale of fishing tackle and other equipment cover only one distinct performance obligations per contract, which are normally not linked to any other goods or services, and are thus accounted for separately. The Group recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring goods to customers, which is when the customer obtains control of the goods. Some contracts with customers include cash discounts, volume rebates and marketing support fees. Such provisions give rise to variable consideration under IFRS 15 and will be required to be estimated at contract inception. The accounting treatment does not materially differ from the Group's current practice.
∑ IFRS 9 includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting and replaces current IAS 39. The impairment model in IFRS 9 is

12

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

based on the premise of providing for expected losses. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Group finalized the impact evaluation and summarized results of the standard, taken necessary actions for implementation of the standard and prepared documentation before the standard effective date. The Group will start reporting according to IFRS 9 from January 1, 2018. No restatement of prior periods is required by the new standard.
The Group has observed that there will be modest, non-material, impacts on the bad debt provisions of trade receivables due to the new ECL (Expected Credit Loss) model introduced by the standard. The Group has finalized the impact assessment of the standard during the fourth quarter of 2017 and if the the Group had already applied this new ECL model at the end of 2017 bad debt provisions would have been EUR 0.1 million greater. The Group designed an ECL model where Group entities were divided by market areas and their trade receivables data were analyzed by aging, actual bad debts and allowance booked. The allowances were analyzed to be higher than the actual bad debts booked. For aging receivables, the percentages are rising based on best estimates regarding the increased risk of expected credit loss and for the receivables over 18 months old, 100% are written off.
In 2019 or later, the Group will adopt the following new, revised or amended standards and interpretations, which are relevant to its operations:
∑ IFRS 16 Leases. According to the current Leases standard, IAS17, a lessee has to separate leases into finance lease agreements booked on the balance sheet and operating lease agreements classified as off-balance sheet items. IFRS 16 standard specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. It introduces a single model for accounting leases on a balance sheet of a lessee. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and low value leases. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard, where leases are classified either as finance or operating leases. Based on the Group's industry and business model it acts mostly as lessee in numerous contracts. The Group has started a preliminary assessment of the impacts on its financial statements. The Group will recognize new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of facilities and vehicles. The nature of lease expenses will change, as IFRS 16 replaces the lease expenses currently shown in other operating expenses with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities shown in financial expenses.
The amount of off-balance sheet commitments was EUR 11 million on December 31, 2017. Agreements treated as commitments however differ from the lease agreements determined by IFRS16 and thus the amount of agreements that will be booked on balance sheet can differ from these commitments. The Group continues with more detailed assessment of the impacts of this new standard.

CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries in which it has control. The control is based either to governing power established through direct or indirect holding of over 50% of the voting rights and/or control established through other means. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same accounting period as the company, using consistent accounting policies.
Acquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition cost method, according to which the assets and liabilities of the acquired company are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group's share of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly through income statement. Goodwill on consolidation is not amortized but tested for impairment annually. Consideration includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement. Also, cost directly related to acquisition were included in the cost of acquisition up to 1 January 2010. The consolidated financial statements include the results of acquired companies for the period from the completion of the acquisition. Conversely, divestments are included up to their date of sale.
Associated companies are companies where the Group holds voting rights of 20≠50% and/or in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. Joint ventures are companies, over which the Group has contractually agreed to share control with another venturer. Currently associated companies and joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Group's share of the profit or loss of an associate or a joint venture is recognized in the consolidated income statement before operating profit.
The Group's interest in an associated company or a joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at an amount that reflects the Group's share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture together with goodwill on acquisition, as amortized, less any impairment. Unrealized gains, if any, between the Group and the associated companies or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's ownership. Associated companies' and joint ventures' financial statements have been converted to correspond with the accounting principles in use in the Group. If the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and any recognition of further losses ceases unless the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associated companies or joint venture.
The investments in subsidiaries have been eliminated using the acquisition cost method. All transactions between Group companies as well as assets and liabilities, dividends and unrealized internal margins in inventories and tangible assets have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interest is presented separately from the net profit and disclosed as a separate item in the equity in accordance with the share of the non-controlling interest. All transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded in equity when the parent company remains in control. When the Group loses the control in a subsidiary, the remaining investment is recognized at fair value through the income statement.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATIONS
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency, measured at fair value, are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Other non-monetary items have been translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses for operating business items are recorded in the appropriate income statement account before operating profit. Foreign exchange gains and losses from the translation of monetary interest-bearing assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in financial income and expenses. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms a part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the company's functional and reporting currency. Income statements of subsidiaries, whose functional and reporting currencies is not euro, are translated into the Group reporting currency using the average exchange rate for the year. Their balance sheets are translated using the exchange rate of balance sheet date. All exchange differences arising on the translation are entered in the statement of other comprehensive income and presented in equity. The translation differences arising from the use of the purchase method of accounting and after the date of acquisition as well as fair value changes of loans which are hedges of such investments are recognized in statement of other comprehensive income and presented in equity. On the disposal of a subsidiary, whose functional and reporting currency is not euro, the cumulative translation difference for that entity is recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign company and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary and translated using the exchange rate of balance sheet date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition prior to January 1, 2004 have been treated as assets and liabilities of the Group, i.e. in euros.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Net sales comprise of consideration received less indirect sales taxes, discounts and exchange rate differences arising from sales denominated in foreign currency. Sales of goods are recognized after the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and no significant uncertainties remain regarding the consideration, associated costs and possible return of goods. The costs of shipping and distributing products are included in other operating expenses. Revenues from services are recorded when the service has been performed.
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Royalty income is

recorded according to the contents of the agreement. Interest income is recognized by the effective yield method. Dividend income is recognized when the company has acquired a right to receive the dividends.
INCOME TAXES The Group's income tax expense includes taxes of the Group companies based on taxable profit for the period, together with tax adjustments for previous periods and the change in deferred income taxes. The income tax effects of items recognized directly in other comprehensive income are similarly recognized. The current tax expense for the financial year is calculated from the taxable profit based on the valid tax rate of each country. The tax is adjusted with possible taxes related to previous periods. The share of results in associated companies is reported in the income statement as calculated from net profit and thus including the income tax charge.
Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method, as measured with enacted tax rates, to reflect the temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. The main temporary differences arise from the depreciation difference on tangible assets, fair valuation of net assets in acquired companies, intra-group inventory profits, defined benefit plans, inventory allowances and other provisions, untaxed reserves and tax losses carried forward. Temporary differences are recognized as a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred, unless they relate to a clearly defined project that meets certain criteria. Development costs for such projects are capitalized if they are separately identifiable and if the products are assessed to be technically feasible and commercially viable and the related future revenues are expected to exceed the aggregate deferred and future development costs and related production, selling and administrative expenses, and if adequate resources exist or will be available to complete the project. Capitalized development costs include all directly attributable material, employee benefit and testing costs necessary to prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended. Research and development costs that were initially recognized as an expense are not to be capitalized at a later date.
Amortization of such a product is commenced when it is available for use. Unfinished products are tested annually for impairment. Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, a maximum of five years.
GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net assets of the subsidiary, associated undertaking or joint venture acquired after January 1, 2004. Until 31.12.2009, any costs directly attributable to the business combination, such as professional fees, were included to the cost of an acquisition. From 1.1.2010 onwards,

14

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

costs related to acquisitions are recognized directly to income statement. Goodwill from the combination of operations acquired prior to January 1, 2004 corresponds to the carrying amount according to the previous financial statement standards, which has been used as the assumed acquisition cost according to IFRS.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For this purpose, goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units. Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss, and is not amortized.

with IFRS 5 standard Non-Current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations.
BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs, that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets include customer relations, trademarks, capitalized development expenses, patents, copyrights, licenses and software. An intangible asset is recognized in the balance sheet only if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at cost, amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives which vary from 3 to 15 years and adjusted for any impairment charges.
Trademarks and other intangible assets whose useful life is estimated to be indefinite are estimated to affect cash flow accumulation for an undefined period of time. The expected useful life for most trademarks is indefinite and therefore they are not amortized. These intangibles are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss and not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually. The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is based on fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Expected useful lives and indefinite lives of intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and, where they differ significantly from previous estimates, amortization periods are changed accordingly.

TANGIBLE ASSETS
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost, amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life and adjusted for any impairment charges. The valuation of tangible assets acquired in a business combination is based on fair value as at the date of acquisition. Land is not depreciated as it is deemed to have an indefinite life.

Depreciation is based on the following expected useful lives:

Buildings and structures

10≠25 years

Machinery and equipment 

5≠10 years

Other tangible assets 

3≠10 years

Expected useful lives of tangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and, where they differ significantly from previous estimates, depreciation periods are changed accordingly. Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of significant renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. Gains and losses on sales and disposals are determined by comparing the received proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income statement in other operating income and expenses.
Depreciation of a tangible asset is discontinued when the tangible asset is classified as being held-for-sale in accordance

GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government or other grants are recognized in the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs, which they are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to purchase of tangible assets are recognized as revenue on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. In the balance sheet, grants are deducted from the value of the asset they relate to. The grants are recognized to decrease depreciations over the useful life of the asset. Currently, all grants of the Group have been recognized in the income statement as other operating income.
IMPAIRMENTS OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If indication exists, the recoverable amount is measured. Indications of potential need for impairment may be for example changes in market conditions and sales prices, decisions on significant restructurings or change in profitability.
Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and unfinished intangible assets are in all cases tested annually. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest cash generating unit level for which there are separately identifiable, mainly independent, cash inflows and outflows.
An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by reference to discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment loss is immediately recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a cash-generating unit are used to deducting first the goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and, thereafter, the other assets of the unit on an equal basis. The useful life of the asset to be depreciated is reassessed in connection with the recognition of the impairment loss. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. However, the reversal must not cause that the adjusted value is higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years. Impairment losses recognized for goodwill are not reversed.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE Non-current assets (or a disposal group) are classified as heldfor-sale, if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through the disposal of the assets rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the sale must be highly probable, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary, the management must be committed to selling and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets held-for-sale (or assets included in the disposal group) are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less estimated selling expenditure. After an asset has been classified as held-for-sale, it is not depreciated. If the classification criterion is not met, the classification is reversed and the asset is measured at the lower of carrying amount prior to the classification less depreciation and impairment, and recoverable amount. A non-current asset held-for-sale and assets included in the disposal group classified as held-for-sale are disclosed separately from the other asset items.
ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES Group as a lessee Leases of tangible assets, where the Group has substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in interest-bearing liabilities with the interest element of the finance charge being recognized in the income statement over the lease period. Tangible assets acquired under finance lease contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or lease period.
Leases of tangible assets, where the lessor retains all the risks and benefits of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Payments made there under, and under rental agreements, are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Received incentives are deducted from the paid leases based on the time elapse of benefit.
Currently the Group does not have other arrangements that contain a lease.
Group as a lessor Those leases under which the Group is a lessor are classified as operating leases. Leased assets are presented in the balance sheet under tangible assets according to the nature of the asset. They are depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with the depreciation policy used for comparable assets in own use. Lease income is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge.

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets after initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate reevaluates this designation at each financial year-end. Financial assets include current and non-current assets and they can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held-for-trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. The Group has not applied the fair value option. Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. All of the Group's currency derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are classified as financial assets held-for-trading. Financial assets classified as held-for-trading are measured at fair value. Unrealized and realized changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group has a positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. Initially recognized amount includes directly attributable transaction costs. Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when loans and receivables are derecognized, impaired, and through the amortization process.
Financial assets that are not classified in the preceding categories are classified as available-for-sale. When availablefor-sale financial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value by using quoted market rates and market prices, discounted cash flow analyses and other appropriate valuation models. Certain unlisted shares for which fair values cannot be measured reliably are reported at cost less impairment. The fair value changes of available-for-sale financial assets, net of tax, are recognized as other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value are transferred from the statement of other comprehensive income to the income statement when the instrument is sold or its value has fallen so that an impairment loss has to be recognized for the instrument. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized on the trade date.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group is exposed to financial risks related especially to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates for loans and borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are used, from time to time, to hedge financial risk. All derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on each balance sheet date. Determination of fair values is based on quoted market prices and rates, discounting of cash flows and option valuation models. The fair values of these instruments are received from the respective bank or calculated to match the current market price. Currently, the Group does not have embedded derivatives.
Derivatives may be designated as hedging instruments, in which case hedge accounting is applied. At the inception of a

16

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

hedge relationship, the Group designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument's fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. In the case hedge accounting is applied, the accounting for hedging instruments is dependent on the particular nature of the hedging relationship.
In cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized as other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Accumulated fair value changes recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income are reclassified into income statement in the period when the hedged cash flow affects income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in the income statement based on their nature either in the operative costs if the hedged item is an operative foreign currency transaction or as financial income or expenses, if the hedged item is a monetary transaction.
Changes of the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as hedg¨ing instruments but are not accounted for according to the principles of hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement based on their nature either in the operative costs, if the hedged item is an operative transaction, or as financial income or expenses, if the hedged item is a monetary transaction.
In principal, the fair values of derivative instruments are presented in the statement of financial position under short-term or long-term non-interest bearing assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of monetary assets or liabilities, are presented in the same group of interest-bearing assets or liabilities as the hedged instrument.
Effective portion of changes in the fair values of foreign currency hedges used against the translation differences arising from the consolidation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in translation differences in the statement of other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognized in financial income and expenses. Accumulated fair value changes recognized in the items of other comprehensive income are reclassified into income statement if the hedged subsidiary is disposed of partially or in its entity.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories: derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

(including other derivatives) and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities, except derivatives, are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration received plus directly attributable transactions costs. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Also commercial paper programs are measured at amortized cost. Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized, impaired and through the amortization process.
Financial liabilities include current and non-current liabilities and they can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Contingent considerations of business combinations are classified as non-interest-bearing financial liabilities.
RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets and liabilities, except for derivatives and available-for-sale financial assets, are recognized at the settlement date. A financial asset or a financial liability is recognized on the balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
A financial asset is derecognized only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when it transfers the financial asset, so that all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are substantially transferred. A financial liability or a part of a financial liability is removed from the balance sheet only when it is extinguished, that the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial asset is impaired. An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is measured as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is measured as a difference between its acquisition costs and its current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in the income statement. An impairment loss in respect of an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value, because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
All impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognized previously in the items of other comprehensive income is reclassified into income statement when the asset is sold or when the impairment is permanent.
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For financial assets amortized at cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized in the income statement. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income. An impairment loss in respect of an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value, because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, cannot be reversed.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or, alternatively, weighted average cost where it approximates FIFO. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labor, depreciation, other direct costs and related production overheads, but excludes borrowing costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are presented net of net realizable value allowance recognized for obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are carried at their anticipated realizable value, which is the original invoice amount less an estimated valuation allowance. A credit loss allowance of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence (such as significant overdue of receivables and unsuccessful dunning attempts or known financial difficulties and thus increased probability of customer insolvency) that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The assessment and decision for credit loss allowances is done locally in each business unit on case-by-case basis.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current interest-bearing loans.
HYBRID BOND A hybrid bond is an instrument which is presented under equity in the consolidated financial statements. A hybrid bond is subordinated to the company's other debt obligations, but has seniority over other equity items. The yield on a hybrid bond is paid if the Group distributes a dividend. If no dividend is distributed, the Group will make a separate decision on whether to pay the yield. Unpaid yields are accumulated. The holders of a hybrid bond do not possess the same rights as shareholders concerning control or voting at General Meetings of shareholders.
OWN SHARES Own shares acquired by the Group, including directly attributable costs, are presented as a deduction from the total equity on the day of trading in the consolidated financial statements. Purchases or subsequent sales of treasury shares are presented as changes in equity.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are valued at the net present value of the expenses required to cover the obligation. The discount factor used when calculating present value is selected so that it describes the market view of the time value of the money and the risk relating to the obligation at the time of examination.
A warranty provision is recognized when a product containing a warranty clause is sold. The size of the sum involved is determined on the basis of what is known about past warranty costs. A restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has compiled a detailed restructuring plan, launched its implementation or has informed the parties concerned.
WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT The Group is a distributor of electrical equipment that falls under the EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Expected costs are recognized as part of other operating expenses and as a current non-interest-bearing payable.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Employee benefit obligations Throughout the Group operates various pension plans in accordance with local conditions and practices. The plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
For defined benefit plans, costs are assessed using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method, in which the cost of providing benefit is charged to the income statement so as to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries who carry out a full valuation of the plan. The benefit obligation is measured as the present value of estimated future cash outflows. Defined benefit liability comprises of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets. All actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income immediately as they occur. The past service cost is recognized as an expense in the income statement.
Share-based payments Share-based payment programs are valued at fair value on the grant date and recognized as an expense in the income statement during the vesting period with a corresponding adjustment to the equity or liability. In the cash settled option program the liability is revalued at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. The income statement effect of the share-based payments programs is recognized in employee benefit expenses.
The expense of the share-based payments determined at the grant date reflects the Group's estimate of the number of options or share rewards that will ultimately vest. Grant date is the date at which the entity and another party agree to a share-based payment arrangement, being when the entity and the counterparty have a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. The options are valued at fair value using Black-Scholes

18

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

option-pricing model. The non-market criteria are not included in the fair value of the option but taken into account in the number of options that are assumed to vest. On a regular basis the Group reviews the assumptions made and revises its estimates of the share-based payments that are expected to be settled. The changes in the estimates are recognized in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the equity or liability.
When the share options are exercised, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited in the fund for invested non-restricted equity.
DIVIDEND The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is not deducted from distributable equity until approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury shares, if any.
Diluted earnings per share amounts have been calculated by applying the "treasury stock" method, as if the options were exercised at the beginning of the period, or on the issuance of options, if that occurs later during the period, and as if the funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. In addition to the weighted average number of shares outstanding, the denominator includes the incremental shares obtained through the assumed exercise of the options. The assumption of exercise is not reflected in earnings per share when the exercise price of the options exceeds the average market price of the shares during the period. The share options have a diluting effect only when the average market price of the share during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options.
OPERATING PROFIT The IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) standard does not define operating profit. The Group has defined it as follows: Operating profit is the net amount arising from adding other operating income and share of results in associates and joint ventures to net sales, deducting cost of sales corrected for changes in inventories and cost of production for own use, deducting costs related to employee benefits, depreciation and possible impairments as well as other operating expenses. Foreign exchange differences and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in operating profit in case they originate from operative business items; otherwise they are booked in financial income and expenses.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT Cash and cash equivalents presented in the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash generated from operating activities has been reported using the indirect method. All income taxes paid during the financial year are presented in Net cash generated from operating activities, unless they can be particularly allocated to net cash from

(used in) investing or financing activities. Unrealized exchange gains and losses from cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are presented on a separate row before cash and cash equivalents at the end of period, separate from cash generated from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities.
COMPARABLE OPERATING PROFIT AND ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY In order to reflect the underlying business performance and to enhance comparability between financial periods, the Group presents alternative performance measures. Comparable operating profit is operating profit excluding mark-to-market valuations of operative currency derivatives and other items affecting comparability, which include material restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on business combinations and disposals, insurance compensations and other non-operational items. Alternative performance measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, judgment has to be exercised in applying the accounting principles of the financial statements. Management's estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and plausible future scenarios, which are continually evaluated. Possible changes in estimates and assumptions are recognized in the accounting period during which estimates and assumptions were fixed and in all subsequent accounting periods.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of uncertainty related to estimations at the balance sheet date, that have significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next accounting period, are discussed below.
Determining fair value of acquisitions The fair values of acquired working capital and tangible assets were evaluated by the Group and when needed external appraisal personnel before the acquisition. The fair value of intellectual property rights (trademarks, patents and technology) and customer relations are established with discounting the related cash flows.
Impairment testing The carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and unfinished tangible assets are in all cases tested annually. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest cash generating unit level for which there are separately identifiable, mainly independent, cash inflows and outflows. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by reference to discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These calculations require the use of estimates.

19

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

Income taxes The Group reviews at each balance sheet date especially the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method, as measured with enacted tax rates, to reflect the temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. The main temporary differences arise from the depreciation difference on tangible assets, fair valuation of net assets in acquired companies, intra-group inventory profits, defined benefit plans, inventories and other provisions, untaxed reserves and tax losses carried forward. Temporary differences are recognized as a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. The likelihood for the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income is assessed, and to the extent the recovery is not considered likely the deferred asset is adjusted in accordance. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews whether distribution of earnings in subsidiaries is in its control and probable, and books a deferred tax accordingly.
Defined benefit obligations Costs for defined benefit plans are assessed using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Several statistical and other actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, future salary increase and annual inflation rate. Statistical information used may differ from actual results. Changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive income immediately as they occur which could have a slight impact on the Group's statement of comprehensive income.
Provisions The timing of the recognition of a provision is based on management's estimate of the moment when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Hyperinflation The Group may have operations in hyperinflatory economies. The financial statements of a subsidiary whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in accordance of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflatory Economies) in case the adjustments are material in relation to the Group's consolidated financial statements.
ROUNDING OF FIGURES The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros. All figures in these accounts have been rounded. Consequently, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the presented sum figure. Key figures have been calculated using exact figures.
In the financial statements, EUR 0.0 million means the figure is less than EUR 50 000. If the amount is EUR 0, the cell is left empty.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Rapala Group is led as a whole, as an integrated chain of units engaged in manufacturing, sourcing and distributing of mainly fishing tackle equipment as well as hunting, outdoor and winter sports equipment. The base unit of the Group's management is a single subsidiary engaged in one or several activities within the integrated supply chain. Each subsidiary and business is represented by a member in the Executive committee. The Group does not have any structure of independently led divisions, but the Group is managed as a whole. The Group's CEO, together with the Board of Directors is the ultimate decision maker.
Despite the integrated nature of the Group's operations, the type and source of products being processed by the units creates difference in the Group's management approach. There is a distinction in the strategic and operative role of the products depending on whether the product sold is being manufactured by the Group itself; whether the product is sourced by the Group externally, but sold under one of the Group's own brands; whether the product is a third party product represented and distributed by the Group; or whether the product is part of Group's core fishing tackle business or some supporting product category outside of fishing. This distinction between the type and source of products is the basis for the Group's operating segments.
The Group's operating segments are Group Fishing Products, Other Group Products and Third Party Products. Group Fishing Products and Other Group Products have been combined to reportable segment Group Products. Group Fishing Products are fishing tackle products manufactured or sourced by the Group itself and sold under the Group's brands. Group Fishing Products include Lures and Baits, Fishing Hooks, Fishing Lines and Fishing Accessories. Other Group Products include Group manufactured and/or branded products for winter sports and some other nonfishing businesses. Third Party Products include non-Group branded fishing products and third party products for hunting, outdoor and winter sports, which are distributed by the Group utilizing the same supply channel as Group Fishing Products and Other Group Products.
The Group has changed the measurements of segment performance by excluding items affecting comparability from operating profit. The Group measures segment performance based on sales, comparable operating profit and assets. Comparable operating profit is adjusted by mark-to-market valuations of operative currency derivatives and other items affecting comparability including material restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on business combinations and disposals, insurance compensations and other non-operational items. Definitions of the alternative performance measures are presented in Definitions of Key Figures on page 46. All the other segment reporting is consistent with IFRS accounting principles. Reportable segments are consistent with those in the financial statements 2016.
Pricing of inter-segment transactions is based on market prices.

Deferred taxes have been reported as a net balance according to IAS 12. As of December 31, 2017, the Group had tax losses carried forward of EUR 25.0 million (2016: EUR 33.3 million), for which deferred tax assets have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements because the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. EUR 3.0 million of these tax losses will expire during the next five years (2016: EUR 5.0 million).
Deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries has not been recognized in the consolidated balance sheet because distribution of the earnings is in the control of the Group and such distribution is not probable within the foreseeable future.
The consolidated balance sheet includes deferred tax assets of EUR 1.5 million (2016: EUR 1.9 million) in group companies, which have generated losses in financial year 2017 or 2016. The recognition of these assets is based on profit estimates, which indicate that the realization of these deferred tax assets is probable.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND TRADEMARKS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES
The Group is led as a whole and not organized nor managed in independent divisions. Most of the units are also strongly interlinked i.e. some units do not have a sales or a production organization or some other functions or operations needed to operate on a stand-alone basis. However, according to IFRS, the lowest cash-generating unit (CGU) cannot be larger than an operating segment in the Group's segment reporting. As a consequence, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are tested on the operating segment level.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. Cash flow projections, which were used in these calculations, were based on most recent 5-year financial forecasts prepared by the management and approved by the Board. The estimated sales and production volumes are derived from the utilization of existing property, plant and equipment. The most important assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections are the sales and profitability. Discount rate is the weighted average pre-tax cost of capital (WACC) which is defined for each cash-

generating unit separately. The components of WACC are the risk-free yield rate, market risk premium, industry specific beta, cost of debt, and target capital structure. In the impairment tests prepared in 2017 and 2016, the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flow beyond the five-year period is 0%. As a result of the performed impairment tests, no impairment losses have been recognized in 2017 or 2016.
Key assumptions Sales ≠ The Group's estimated sales are based on present and future product assortment and utilization of distribution and manufacturing capacity. In addition, estimated sales are based on long-term growth of industry and further implementation of Group's strategic objectives.
EBITDA margin ≠ The Group's estimated EBITDA margin, operating profit before depreciation and impairments compared to net sales, is based on past years actual margins and management's view on sales and gross margin development. The increase in general cost level has also been taken into account in the development of EBITDA margin.
Discount rate ≠ Discount rate is the weighted average pretax cost of capital (WACC). Weighted average cost of capital represents the total cost of Group's equity and debt taken into account specific risks related to assets.
Growth rate ≠ Compared to historical sales growth development, management has been conservative in determining the growth rate for impairment purposes.
Sensitivity analysis The key sensitivity factors for the impairment test are the estimated EBITDA margin and the discount rate. According to the Group's management in the main business segments Group Fishing Products and Third Party Products no probable change in any of the key sensitivity factors would lead to a situation where the carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount. Even if the discount rate would be 8.2 percentage points higher in Group Fishing Products and 1.6 percentage points in Third Party Products or EBITDA 45.6 percentage lower than used in the management's estimates in Group Fishing Products and 18.0 percentage points in Third Party Products, it would not lead to an impairment loss in these main cash generating units.

In most cases allowances are determined individually, when there is objective evidence (such as significant overdue of receivables and unsuccessful dunning attempts or known financial difficulties and thus increased probability of customer insolvency) that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Group's policy is to book a 50% minimum allowance from receivables over 6 months past due and a 100% allowance from receivables over 12 months past due.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The main objective of the Group's financial risk management is to reduce the impacts of price fluctuations in financial markets and other factors of uncertainty on earnings, cash flows and balance sheet, as well as to ensure sufficient liquidity. The Board has approved the Group's risk management principles and CEO is responsible, together with the Chief Financial Officer, for development and implementation of financial risk management procedures.
Group Risk Management review financial risks on regular basis to manage Group's financial risk position and decide on necessary actions to manage financial risks. Group Risk Management continued monitoring and management of foreign exchange, interest rate, liquidity and counterparties' solvency risks.
Financial risks consist of market risks, credit and default risks and liquidity risks. This note also presents the Group's capital management.
MARKET RISKS The Group's market risks are mainly caused by changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. These changes may have a significant impact on the Group's earnings, cash flows and balance sheet. The Group is also exposed to market price changes of certain raw materials, mainly metals and plastics, which are priced on commodity markets.
1. Foreign exchange risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group's operating activities, when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency, financing, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, and the Group's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The Group's foreign exchange risk is managed by the business units and Group Risk Management in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Risk Management policy approved by the Board of Directors.
Foreign exchange transaction risk Foreign exchange transaction exposure arises when an operating unit has commercial or financial transactions and payments in other than its own functional currency, and when related cash inflow and outflow amounts are not equal or noncurrent.
As a result of sales and purchases in foreign currencies as well as operations in several jurisdictions, the Group has foreign currency denominated receivables and payables that are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses within different currencies net each other out to some extent, creating thus an effective natural hedge. The remaining, estimated 12-15 month commercial net exposure is then systematically hedged by using derivative instruments. Depending on whether foreign currency monetary receivables and payables relate to sales and purchases or financial items, the foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement either above or below operating profit.
The Group has also intra-group loans denominated in currencies that exposes the Group to currency risk that is not fully eliminated on consolidation. In order to hedge currency

risk arising from intra-group loans, part of the Group's external financing is denominated in foreign currencies. Depending on whether these loans are classified as net investments on foreign operations or loan receivables, the foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the other comprehensive income or income statement. The connections possibly prevailing between different currencies are not taken into account, e.g. US dollar and Honk Kong dollar are considered as separate currencies in this analysis.
Business units are responsible for forecasting net foreign cash flows and do most of their currency hedging transactions with the Group's parent company. Group Risk Management is responsible for monitoring the Group's consolidated currency risk exposure and when needed, enters into derivative transactions with group external counterparties.
Derivative instruments that are used for hedging purposes are mainly short term and can include forward contracts, option contracts and structured instruments. Because the Group does not apply hedge accounting on currency derivatives, the income statement effect arising from fair value changes of derivative instruments is recognized partly or entirely in different financial periods than exchange rate gains and losses arising from the hedged cash flows.
In 2017 currency derivatives that are used for operative hedging purposes had an income statement effect of EUR -0.2 million (2016: EUR 0.3 million). Fair values and nominal values of currency derivatives are summarized under section 4. Derivatives.
At the end of 2017 and 2016 the following currencies represent a significant portion of the currency mix in the outstanding financial instruments:

1) Currency derivatives are used to hedge both transaction risks and translation risks. Hence the derivatives and transaction risks cannot be netted to a net position.

Foreign exchange translation risk The group is exposed to currency translation risk through its investments in foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies with equities' denominated in foreign currencies. The most significant translation exposures are in USD, HKD, IDR, SEK and ZAR, which comprise approximately 83.1% of the total translation exposure. In the Group consolidation equity changes resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates are presented as translation differences within the equity.
The Group Risk Management monitors regularly the amounts of net investments denominated in foreign currencies and when needed, enters into hedging transactions in order to reduce the

volatility in equity in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2017 the Group did not hedge any equity exposure.
The total non-euro denominated equity excluding net income of the Group's subsidiaries and associated companies was EUR 169.9 million as of December 31, 2017 (2016: EUR 194.0 million). The exposures are summarized in the following table.

Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions and factors: ∑ The sensitivity analysis is based on change of value in
a single analyzed currency and assumes other variables (including values of other currencies) to remain unchanged. The connections possibly prevailing between some currencies are not taken into account. ∑ The sensitivity is analyzed against balance sheet conversion rates prevailing at December 31, 2017. ∑ The analysis includes the effect of income statement transactions made in the analyzed currency between January 1 and December 31 in Group companies, whose functional currency is other than the analyzed currency (so called transaction impact) as well as in Group companies, whose functional currency equals to the analyzed currency (so called translation impact). The analysis takes into account the currency forward contracts in place at December 31. The sensitivity analysis of income statement transactions excludes Group's internal items as these net out. ∑ The sensitivity analysis includes the effect of the translation of subsidiaries' equity as per December 31 in subsidiaries, whose reporting currency equals to the analyzed currency.

in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group's interest-bearing liabilities have mainly an interest period length shorter than one year.
The Group's funding, and consequently also interest rate risk, is managed centrally by the Group's parent company. Interest rate risk, covering cash flow and fair value risk, is analyzed regurarly by the Group Risk Management who is also responsible of taking the actions needed to change the Group's risk position. These actions include changing the currency split of the external loan portfolio, selection between different sources of financing, changing the interest rate duration as well as entering into transactions in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative instruments that are used for hedging purposes consist of interest rate swaps, where the Group pays fixed rate interest and receives a variable rate interest. As at December 31, 2017 the Group had interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Fair values and nominal values of interest rate swaps are presented under section 4. Derivatives.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis Below is presented the effect of liabilities with variable interest rate and interest rate swaps on net income and equity if there was a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates. The sensitivity analysis is based on following assumptions and factors: ∑ All other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, are
assumed to remain unchanged. ∑ The sensitivity is analyzed against interest rates applicable on
December 31, 2017. ∑ The sensitivity analysis includes the liabilities and interest rate
swaps with variable interest rate in force on Dec. 31.

3. Other market price risks The Group purchases certain raw-materials, which are priced on global financial markets. These include commodity metals such as copper, zinc and lead, and certain plastics. The value of these purchases is relatively low and actions regarding the management of price risk are decided on an performed locally in each manufacturing unit. The Group does not currently hedge commodity price risk.
The amount of the Group's investments in available-for-sale financial assets is insignificant and consists of investments in real estate and other unquoted shares for which reliable market values are not obtainable.
4. Derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments, such as forward contracts, option contracts, swaps and structured instruments, to manage foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk in accordance with the guidelines set by the The Group's Risk Management policy. Foreign currency derivatives, consisting of forward contracts,

34

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

option contracts and structured instruments, are used to reduce the uncertainty in the fair value of future cash flows that is created by changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair values of the foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments in accordance with IAS 39, are recognized based on their nature either in operative costs, if the hedge item is an operative transaction, or in financial income and expenses, if the hedged item is a monetary transaction. Because hedge accounting is not applied, the P&L effect arising from foreign currency derivatives is recognized partly or entirely in different financial period than exchange rate gains and losses arising from the hedged cash flows.
Interest rate derivatives, consisting of interest rate swaps, are used to reduce the volatility of interest expenses in the income statement and to adjust the duration of the debt portfolio. Part of the interest rate derivative contracts have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow and fair value hedging and are accounted for accordingly, if hedge accounting is applied.

Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated as and qualify for cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income. Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement in financial income or expenses. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income statement. Interest element of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate interest-bearing liabilities is recognized in the income statement within financial income or expenses.
In 2017, the amount of the ineffective portion that was recognized in the financial income and expenses of income statement was EUR 0.0 million (2016: EUR 0.0 million). Testing for effectiveness of the hedging relationship is conducted on a monthly basis.

LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is defined as financial distress or extraordinarily high financing cost arising due to a shortage of liquid funds in a situation where outstanding debt needs to be refinanced or where business conditions unexpectedly deteriorate and require financing. Transactional liquidity risk is defined as the risk of executing a financial transaction below fair market value, or not being able to execute the transaction at all, within a specific period of time.
The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity, and to ensure that it is available fast enough without endangering its value, in order to avoid uncertainty related to financial distress at all times.
Generally, the seasonality of the Group's cash flow is fairly predictable and Group Treasury monitors Group's liquidity position using the cash pooling system as well as regular cash flow and liquidity reporting.
The Group's interest bearing funding is mainly managed centrally by the Group Treasury. The Group seeks to reduce liquidity and refinancing risks with balanced maturity profile of loans as well as by keeping sufficient amount of credit lines available. The Group has a EUR 80 million domestic commercial paper program, which together with Group's credit limits is utilized to balance the seasonality of the Group's cash flow. The size and maturity of issued commercial papers is decided by Group Treasury, based on forecasted cash flows, status of commercial paper markets and applicable interest rates. The renewal of commercial papers upon maturity creates certain liquidity risk, which is managed by maintaining sufficient other liquidity reserves available at the maturity dates. During 2017 the commercial paper program was used actively as part of Group funding and competitively priced debt was acquired through this market.
Group's loan facilities include ordinary gearing ratios and net debt to EBITDA ratio covenants. The Board and Group management are monitoring the fulfillment of the bank covenants on a monthly basis. The Group has agreed with its financiers a higher acceptable level for net debt to EBITDA ratio for the end of 2017. The Group expects to fulfill the requirements of the financiers in 2018.
Below are presented the Group's unutilized credit limits as of December 31, 2017. Group's domestic commercial paper program not sold at December 31, 2017 was EUR 48.0 million (2016 EUR 20.0 million).

CREDIT AND DEFAULT RISK
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the financial assets as included in the consolidated statement of financial position. The carrying value of financial assets is disclosed in note 23.
The Group follows actively credit and default risks associated with customers and other counterparties. The proportional amount of Group's trade receivables which are past due, increased

moderately from 2016. Net allowance for credit losses related to trade receivables increased EUR 0.5 million from 2016.
Business related credit risk The Group's accounts receivables are generated by a large number of customers worldwide and do not include any significant concentrations of credit risk by customer or by geographical area.
The management of credit risk is allocated to each operative business unit. Before providing credit to any new customer, background checks are carried out. Cash, advance payments and letters of credit are also applied with new and existing customers. Each business unit is responsible for setting credit limits and monitoring it's credit customers' financial situation. Customers' payment behavior is monitored regularly and delays in

36

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS

payments can trigger payment reminders, stopping the shipments, requirements for advance payments for future shipments and eventually legal collection procedures. In significant cases, business units consult with the Group's finance management before taking final decisions. In exceptional cases, payment terms may be renegotiated.
The group recognizes an impairment loss on trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default in payments are considered as indicators that a trade receivable is impaired. No allowance is recognized on trade receivables that are past due, when solvency of the customer is considered solid. The assessment and decision of recognition of an impairment loss is taken locally in each business unit on case-by-case basis.
More information on allowance for trade receivables is presented in note 16.
In the table below is presented analysis of trade receivables that were past due but not impaired.

Financial credit risk Financial instruments contain an element of risk resulting from changes in market price of such instruments due to counterparties becoming less creditworthy or risk of loss due to counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. This risk is measured and monitored centrally by the Group Risk Management.
Financial credit risk is managed actively by limiting counterparties to a sufficient number of major banks and financial institutions and monitoring the credit worthiness and exposure size continuously as well as through entering into collateral agreements with certain counterparties. The Group reduces credit risk by executing treasury transactions only with approved counterparties. All significant counterparties are rated with the minimum counterparty credit rating requirement being BBB (S&P). Foreign subsidiaries may have bank accounts in unrated financial institutions. In order to decrease credit risk associated with local banks used by subsidiaries in foreign countries, the subsidiaries are required to deposit their excess cash balances with the Group Treasury on an ongoing basis.
Group's all investments related to liquidity management are made in liquid instruments with low credit risk. For instance, the Group does not have investments in commercial papers.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to maximize shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it taking into account changes in economic conditions and requirements of strategy implementation. To maintain or develop the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments and repayments of capital to shareholders by buying back shares, issue new shares and/or increase/decrease the amount of borrowings.
Group's objective for capital management is to keep: 1. Gearing ratio below 150% and 2. Net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA (rolling 12 months)
below 3.8.
The Group capital structure is reviewed by the Board regularly. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than the financial covenants set by the banks, which are derived from the above mentioned key figures. For more information on financial covenants set by the banks, see section on liquidity risks. The Group has temporarily higher net interestbearing debt to EBITDA, but the Group's objective is to reach the above target during 2018.
The achievement of the objectives for capital management are presented in the table below.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value hierarchy levels The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities on the hierarchy level 1 are based on quoted market prices of similar financial instruments traded in an active market. Currently there are no financial instruments on level 1.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities on the hierarchy level 2 are based on other price information than quoted market prices for a significant part of the valuation. This information is supported by observable market inputs either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities on the hierarchy level 3 are calculated using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by available observable market data. For example management estimates are utilized in generally accepted valuation models of the financial instruments on the Level 3. The fair value hierarchy level, into which the entire financial asset or liability is classified, is determined based on the lowesthierarchy-level information being significant for the valuation of that particular financial asset or liability. The significance of the information is estimated considering the financial asset or liability in its entirety.
No significant transfers between the hierarchy levels took place during the financial period.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments comprise of unlisted shares that are measured at fair value. Certain unlisted shares for which fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less possible impairment.
Derivatives All derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on each balance sheet date.

Determination of fair values is based on quoted market prices and rates, discounting of cash flows and option valuation models.
Finance leases The fair value of finance lease liabilities corresponds to their book value. The fair value of finance leases is based on discounted future cash flows. The discount rate used corresponds to that applied to similar finance leases.
Current financial assets and liabilities Due to their short maturity, the fair value of current financial assets and liabilities is regarded as corresponding to their original carrying amount.
Non-current financial assets The fair value of non-current financial assets is based on discounted future cash flows. The discount rate used corresponds to the market rate on the balance sheet date.
Non-current interest-bearing liabilities On December 31, 2017, 0.0% (2016: 23.3%) of non-current loans based on floating rates was connected to one-month euribor, libor or similar and the rest to maximum six-month euribor, libor or similar. Therefore, the fair value of non-current loans based on floating rates is regarded as equaling their book value. A part of non-current loans on floating rates is hedged with separate interest rate derivatives which are described in note 22. The fair value of non-current loans on fixed rates is based on discounted future cash flows. The discount rate used corresponds to the market rate on the balance sheet date.
Non-current non-interest-bearing liabilities Contingent considerations of business combinations and other acquisitions are recognized at fair value on the date of acquisition. Determination of fair values is based on discounted future cash flows.

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The financial statements of Rapala VMC Oyj have been prepared according to Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS).
Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and exchange differences arising from translation are recognized in the income statement.
Revenue recognition Sales of goods and services are recognized on accrual basis when the significant risks related to goods and services sold have passed to the buyer and it is not probable that the client would return the goods. Net sales comprise of gross sales less cash discounts and sales taxes.
Research and development costs Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred, unless they clearly relate to developing new business areas. Such development costs are capitalized if they are separately identifiable and if the products are assessed to be technically feasible and commercially viable and the related future revenues are expected to exceed the accrued and future development costs and related production, selling and administrative expenses, and other possible costs related to the project.
Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, a maximum of five years.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises of raw materials, direct labor costs including social costs and other direct costs. Inventories are shown net of a reserve for obsolete or slowmoving inventories.
Tangible and intangible assets Tangible and intangible assets are stated at historical cost excluding accumulated depreciation according to plan. Planned depreciation is based on historical cost and expected useful life.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is based on the following expected useful lives:

Intangible assets Buildings  Machinery and equipment Other tangible assets

3≠15 years 10≠20 years 5≠10 years 3≠10 years

Pension arrangements All of the company's pension arrangements are defined contribution plans, with the majority being local statutory arrangements. Pension costs are expensed as incurred.
Valuation of financial derivatives All derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on each balance sheet date. Fair value of standard foreign currency forwards are determined by discounting the future nominal cash flows with relevant interest rates and then converting the discounted cash flows to the foreign currency using spot rates. Determination of fair values of other derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices and rates, discounting of cash flows and option valuation models. The fair values of these instruments are either computed by Bloomberg market data tool by the company or received from the respective bank.
In cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement as well as the change in fair value of the contracts that are not designated to hedge accounting.
Own shares Own shares acquired by the company, including directly attributable costs, are presented as a deduction from the total equity on the day of trading. Purchases or subsequent sales of treasury shares are presented as changes in equity.
Cash flow statement Changes in financial position are presented as cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

In 2017, changes in fair values of currency derivatives had an income statement effect of EUR -565 thousand (2016: EUR -1 422 thousand) and interest rate derivatives EUR 231 thousand (2016: EUR -2 248 thousand). Hedge accounting is applied for some of the interest rate derivatives, and the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives under hedge accounting has been directly booked to fair value reserve in equity.

Guarantees consist of subsidiaries' lease agreements and of other guarantees given on behalf of subsidiaries. The company's loan facilities are unsecured and include normal financial covenants.
Since Normark Logistics Europe Oy, a 100% owned subsidiary of Rapala VMC Corporation, is the legal shareholder of the distribution joint venture with Shimano Inc., the parent company has guaranteed to Shimano the fulfillment of its subsidiary's obligations related to the joint venture.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT

The objective of Rapala VMC Corporation's risk management is to support the implementation of the Group's strategy and execution of business targets. This is done by monitoring and mitigating the related threats and risks and simultaneously identifying and managing opportunities.
APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT The Board evaluates the Group's financial, operational and strategic risk position regularly and establishes related policies and instructions to be implemented and coordinated by Group management. The daily risk management activities are primarily delegated to the management of business units.
Risk management continued to receive management attention in 2017. The focus of Group level risk management in 2017 was on foreign exchange risk management as well as risk management activities on liquidity, interest rate and hazard risks. Other emphasized areas were account receivables, Group wide insurance programs and strategic supply chain management.
Below is a summary of key strategic, operational and financial risks as well as the main actions to mitigate these risks.
STRATEGIC RISKS Sport fishing is a form of leisure hobby and the Group's products are competing against a wide range of other hobbies. The Group is promoting the attractiveness of sport fishing through active sales and marketing as well as brand management. By utilizing its unique research and development processes and resources, the Group is constantly developing new products to meet consumer needs and creating new needs for the consumers.
Brand portfolio and corporate reputation are among the most valuable intangible assets of the Group. The Rapala Group is actively managing its brands and their identity and securing that the value of the brands or corporate reputation are not jeopardized or violated by any means. The Group's brands are also legally protected.
Consumers relate the Group's brands to high quality, unique fishing experience, special functional features and trustworthy distribution channel. Consumers are able to differentiate illegal copy products and they don't constitute a strategic threat for the Group. The Group protects vigorously its intellectual property rights and acts against illegal copiers and distributors.
Sport fishing is dependent on availability of fresh fishing waters for fishes to live and breed. Pollution and potential environmental catastrophes are concerns for the Group. The Rapala Group is actively promoting initiatives to enhance environmental protection and increasing preparedness to comply with continuously tightening environmental regulations by taking steps to reduce environmental impacts of its operations and products. The Group is also acting in the forefront to develop products, e.g. catch-and-release equipment, to comply with fish protection initiatives. For more details on environmental actions, see the "Corporate Responsibility and Sustainable Development" report available on corporate website (www.rapalavmc.com).

The Group faces competition in all markets where its products are sold. Due to the uniquely wide distribution network, the Group's geographical market risk is truly globally spread, evening out seasonal and local market fluctuations.
The Rapala Group has a limited amount of global competitors. The biggest competitors have significant power in their home markets, but globally the geographical scope of their operations is smaller. The Group's global distribution network is unique in the industry and difficult to imitate. Within each market, the Group's competitors are often local fishing tackle producers and distributors operating with a limited range of products and narrow geographical scope.
In some countries, competition is created by fishing tackle retailers selling private label products. Cross-border internet sales is an increasing trend and could cause some price erosion. Established fishing tackle brands' expansion into new product categories is also creating competition in some product segments. The strength of the Group's product development and brand portfolio, as well as flexibility to serve different markets with market-specific products ranges, is essential in succeeding in market competition.
The Group's production is spread out in several countries. Some of these countries have higher political risks but simultaneously provide access to competitive labor cost. The Group monitors country risks and costs and is actively seeking ways to manage the risk of rising production and distribution costs.
Manufacturing of sport fishing products is not dependent on any proprietary manufacturing technologies or patents. The Group's manufacturing units are actively monitoring the development of generic manufacturing technologies and considering different production applications.
Distribution of third party fishing and outdoor products creates a material part of the Group's sales. Due to the geographical spread and multitude of the existing and potential suppliers, the Group is not critically dependent on any single product or raw material supplier. The Group's strategic partnerships with Shimano (for the distribution of mainly rods and reels) and Yao I (the producer of Group's Sufix fishing lines) have proven to be successes.
The Group's customer base is geographically and quantitatively well diversified. Customers are mostly countryspecific and not operating globally. The Group is not critically dependent on any single customer: even the biggest single customer represents around 5% of the Group's net sales. The Group is not largely engaged in direct consumer retailing. This is not considered to be a risk as consumer demand is largely driven by brand consciousness and alternative routes to market can be established when needed.
The Board evaluates the Group's strategic risks annually as part of the strategy process and the Group management continuously monitors changes in the business environment. Strategic risk management in local jurisdictions is delegated to the management of each business unit.

RISK MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONAL AND HAZARD RISKS
The fishing tackle business has traditionally been relatively resilient to increased uncertainties and downturns in the general economic climate. The truly global nature of the Group's sales and operations spreads the market risks caused by uncertainties in the global economy.
The underlying consumer demand for the Group's products is seasonal and also impacted by unforeseeable factors such as weather. To offset and balance the seasonality, the Group is engaged in production and distribution of winter fishing and winter sports equipment. To mitigate the effects of seasonality, the Group is also operating with own distribution in the southern hemisphere and is developing its production planning to better respond to changes in the market demand.
Due to the seasonality in demand, the Group's product shipments concentrate annually to relatively short time periods, where supply problems could endanger the sales of the season. Similarly, lower than expected sales volumes may lead to excess inventories, as it is difficult to cancel committed orders within short notice.
There is a high level of dependency between the Group's manufacturing and distribution units and interruption at earlier stage of the supply chain could have knock-on effects throughout the rest of the Group. The importance of proper order forecasting and production planning has increased. The related risks are managed with high level of co-operation between manufacturing and distribution units, safety stocks and extensive insurance coverage. The Group-wide supply chain and logistics initiatives continued in 2017 and mitigated these risks relating to operational efficiencies.
The Group's sales prices are primarily fixed annually or biannually, normally before each season. Sudden changes in raw material prices or foreign exchange rates may have significant impact on costs of some products. The Group aims to push increases in costs to the sales prices immediately or during a period of time. The Group's market risks and mitigation actions are analyzed in more detail in the section "Financial Risks" and in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

In respect of manufacturing activities, the Group is not critically dependent on any single external production factor supplier. Availability of competent production labor is essential and the Group aims to maintain good employer reputation and labor relations.
There are significant dependencies between the Group's manufacturing units, which could cause supply challenges e.g. in case of fire or other hazard. Such hazard could lead to property damages but also to business interruption losses throughout the supply chain. Therefore, the Group emphasizes hazard risk management. The Group has together with its property and business interruption insurer continued to conduct annually several hazard prevention reviews to Group's key factories and distribution warehouses. Group management has also continued to build risk awareness throughout the organization.
The Group constantly develops its global insurance programs, which cover most of the Group companies. Global insurance policies, which take into account the Group's interdependency, are in place for property damage and business interruption, transportation as well as general and product liability. The Group has increased its focus also on mitigating fraud risk.
The Board evaluates the Group's operational risks at least once a year as part of operational plans and budgets. Group management monitors and coordinates the continuous management of operational risks, which is the responsibility of the management of each business unit.
FINANCIAL RISKS
The Group's financial risks consist of market risks, credit and default risks and liquidity risks. The Board evaluates financial risks several times during the year and Group management monitors and manages them continuously. Financial risks are discussed in detail, as required by IFRS 7, in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.

AUDITOR'S REPORT
AUDITOR'S REPORT
TRANSLATION OF THE FINNISH ORIGINAL

TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF RAPALA VMC OYJ
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION We have audited the financial statements of Rapala VMC Oyj (business identity code 1016238-8) for the year ended 31 December, 2017. The financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as well as the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and notes.
In our opinion ∑ the consolidated financial statements give a true and
fair view of the group's financial position as well as its financial performance and its cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. ∑ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
In our best knowledge and understanding, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and group companies are in compliance with laws and regulations applicable in Finland regarding these services, and we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of regulation (EU) 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided have been disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
We have also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls. This includes consideration of whether there was evidence of management bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
1) Revenue recognition Refer to accounting principles for the consolidated accounts and note 2 (Segment information).
The Group focuses on revenue as a key performance measure which could create the incentive for revenue to be recognized before the risks and rewards have been transferred. Due to local entities being relatively independent management may also have an opportunity to overstate revenues.
Proper revenue recognition was determined to be a key audit matter and a significant risk of material misstatement referred to in EU Regulation No 537/241, point (c) of Article 10(2).
Our audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement relating to revenue recognition, which was considered to be a significant risk, included, among others:
∑ Assessing the Group's accounting policies over revenue recognition including those relating to discounts, incentives and rebates and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.
∑ Testing of the Group's controls over correct timing of revenue recognition and over the correct calculation of discounts, incentives and rebates. These controls comprised a combination of transaction level prevent controls and detect controls
∑ Testing the sales of cut-off with substantive analytical procedures supplemented with test of details on a transaction level either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether revenue was recognized in the correct period.
∑ Considering the Group's disclosures in respect of revenues.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

2) Goodwill and intangible assets Refer to accounting principles for the consolidated accounts and note 11 (Intangible assets).
At the balance sheet date, the value of goodwill and intangibles amounted to 73.3 M (78.2 M) representing 27.6 % (24.7 %) of the total assets.
Procedures regarding management's annual impairment test were significant to our audit because the test imposes estimates. The Group management use assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions such as revenue and margin developments.
Our audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement relating to goodwill and intangible assets, included, among others:
∑ Evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group relating to the forecasted revenue growth, profitability and weighted average cost of capital.
∑ We focused on how much recoverable amounts exceed the carrying amounts of cash-generating units and whether any reasonably possible change in assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
∑ Assessing the historical accuracy of management's estimates.
∑ We also assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in note 11 (Intangible assets) in the financial statements about the assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment tests were more sensitive.
3) Inventory allowances Refer to accounting principles for the consolidated accounts and note 17 (Inventories).
The total net value of inventories and related net realizable value allowance as of December 31, 2017 amounted to 92.5 M (102.2 M) and 9.7 M (14.2 M), respectively. The inventories are material to the financial statement representing 34.8 % (32.3 %) of the total assets. The calculation of net realizable value allowance involves management judgment and is thus subject to uncertainty
Our audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement relating to net realizable value allowance, which was considered to be a significant risk, included, among others:
∑ Assessing the Group's accounting policies regarding inventory allowances and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.
∑ Evaluating, amongst others, the analyses and assessments made by management with respect to obsolete and slow-moving inventories, the expected demand and market value related to the items.
∑ Assessing the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in notes 17 (Inventories) in the financial statements.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
∑ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
∑ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.
∑ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
∑ Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going

AUDITOR'S REPORT

concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern. ∑ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view. ∑ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
In our opinion, the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements and the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
