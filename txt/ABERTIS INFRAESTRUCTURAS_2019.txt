ABERTIS INFRAESTRUCTURAS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(*) As indicated in Note 1, effective 1 January 2019 Abertis merged with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. Since business combinations between group companies are specifically excluded from the scope of IFRS 3 and because the corporate transaction was a downstream merger, Abertis considered that the comparative information should be identified with the reporting entity resulting from the merger (i.e., Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.) and, therefore, the comparative information was not adjusted as a result of this transaction.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2019
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. ("Abertis" or "the Parent") was incorporated in Barcelona on 24 February 1967 and its registered office is at Paseo de la Castellana, no. 39 (Madrid).
As described in Nota 15-a, on 10 December 2018 the Boards of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., the Parent's then majority shareholder with an ownership interest of 98.7%, approved the draft terms of merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (the absorbing company) and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (the absorbed company). These draft terms of merger were approved by both the Extraordinary General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and the sole shareholder of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. on 8 February 2019, were executed in a public deed on 14 March 2019 and were registered at the Madrid Mercantile Registry on 15 March 2019. The merger was effective for accounting purposes from 1 January 2019 (see Notes 2-e and 6).
The company object of Abertis is the construction, upkeep and operation (or simply the upkeep and operation) of toll roads under concession arrangements; the management of road concessions in Spain and abroad; the construction of road infrastructure; the operation of service areas; ancillary activities for the construction, upkeep and operation of toll roads and service stations; and any other activity related to transport and communications and/or telecommunications infrastructure for the mobility and transport of people, goods and information, with such authorisation as might be required therefor. It also includes the preparation of studies, reports, designs and contracts, as well as the management and provision of advisory services in relation to the aforementioned activities.
The Parent may carry on its company object, especially its concession activity, directly or indirectly through its ownership interests in other companies, subject, in this respect, to the legal provisions in force at any given time.
8

Abertis is the head of a group engaging in the management of mobility and communications infrastructure, and currently operates in the toll road concessions sector, having completed at 31 December 2019, as indicated in Note 7, the divestment of the satellite telecommunications business through the sale of the subgroup headed by Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat), which was classified as a discontinued operation at 31 December 2018 pursuant to IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Also, since 29 October 2018 the Parent and the other Group companies have formed part of the Atlantia Group, the parent of which is Atlantia, S.p.A. (with registered office at Via Antonio Nibby, 20, Rome, Italy) listed on the Italian Stock Exchange and which, in turn, forms part of the group the parent of which is Edizione, S.r.l. (with registered office at Piazza del Duomo, 19, Treviso, Italy). The detail of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at 31 December 2019 is shown in Appendices I, II and III, respectively. Lastly, Note 27-c includes the information on the most significant concession arrangements held by the Group.
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
a) Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2019, which were obtained from the accounting records kept by the Parent and by the other companies composing the Group, were authorised for issue by the Parent's directors at the Board of Directors meeting held on 4 March 2020.
9

These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group provided for in International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as adopted by the European Union, taking into account all the mandatory accounting principles and rules and measurement bases, and the Spanish Commercial Code, the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, the Spanish Securities Market Law and all other applicable Spanish corporate law, as well as the rules of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), and, accordingly, they present fairly the Abertis Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2019 and the consolidated results of its operations, the changes in consolidated equity and the consolidated cash flows in the year then ended.
Since the accounting policies and measurement bases used in preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2019 may differ from those used by certain Group companies, the required adjustments and reclassifications were made on consolidation to unify the policies and methods used and to make them compliant with IFRSs.
In order to uniformly present the various items composing the consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies and measurement bases adopted by the Parent were applied to all the consolidated companies.
The consolidated and separate financial statements of Abertis and the separate and/or consolidated financial statements of the companies and/or subgroups composing the Group will be submitted to the shareholders or sole shareholder at their respective Annual General Meetings, as applicable, within the legally established time periods. The directors of Abertis consider that the aforementioned financial statements will be approved without any material changes.
The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 were approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Parent held on 19 March 2019.
10

b) Adoption of IFRSs
The Abertis Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with IFRSs, in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002. In Spain, the requirement to present consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as approved by the European Union was also regulated by Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003, of 30 December, on Tax, Administrative, Labour and Social Security Measures.
The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted by Abertis are presented in Note 3.

The effects of applying the aforementioned standards are disclosed in Note 5.

12

ii) Standards and interpretations issued but not yet in force
At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the following standards, amendments and interpretations had been published by the IASB but had not yet become effective, either because their effective date is subsequent to the date of the consolidated financial statements or because they had not yet been adopted by the European Union:

(1) The IASB has proposed to defer the effective date of this IFRS to 1 January 2022 (Exposure Draft Amendments to IFRS 17 issued 26 June 2019).

13

The application of new standards, amendments and interpretations will be considered by the Group once they have been ratified and adopted, as the case may be, by the European Union. In any case, the Parent's directors have assessed the potential impact of applying these standards in the future and consider that their entry into force will not have a material effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
c) Presentation and functional currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in the Group's functional currency, the euro, since this is the currency of the main economic area in which the Group operates. In this connection, the financial statements of the foreign companies presented in a functional currency other than the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are translated to euros using the method described in Note 2-g.vi.
d) Responsibility for the information and use of accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, management was required to make certain accounting estimates and to consider certain factors on which to make judgements. These estimates and judgements, which are assessed on an ongoing basis, are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations regarding future events that are considered to be reasonable in view of the circumstances. Although the estimates used were based on the best information available at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IAS 8, any change in estimates in the future would be applied prospectively from that time, and the effect of the change in the estimates would be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the period in question.
The principal estimates and judgements made in preparing the consolidated financial statements related to:
 The purchase price allocation in business combinations and, especially, the choice of the valuation models and key assumptions for determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination (see Notes 3-h and 6).
 The years of useful life of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (see Notes 3-a and 3-b).
14

 The assumptions used in the impairment tests to determine the recoverable amount of the goodwill, intangible assets and other nonfinancial assets (see Notes 3-c, 8, 9 and 10).
 The business model vis-à-vis the Group's financial assets and the consequent classification thereof (see Note 3-d).
 The estimate of the recoverable amount of the quoted and unquoted financial assets and the financial assets relating to the concession arrangements held by the Group, in particular the balance relating to RD 457/2006 (see Notes 3-d and 13).
 The significant increase in credit risk which led to a change from the general 12-month expected credit loss to a lifetime expected credit loss model (see Notes 3-d and 13).
 The fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments (see Notes 3-d, 3-e and 12).
 The estimate of the maintenance cycles in determining the provisions recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12 (see Notes 3-n and 21).
 The assessment of litigation, provisions, obligations and contingent assets and liabilities at year-end (see Notes 20 and 23).
 The assumptions used in determining pension and other obligations to employees (see Notes 3-l and 20).
 The estimate of the income tax expense and the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets (see Notes 3-k and 19).
 Where applicable, the consequences for the scope of consolidation of the Group (see Note 6) and of non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (see Notes 3-h and 7).
The consolidated financial statements were prepared on an historical cost basis, except in the cases specifically indicated in these Notes, such as the line items measured at fair value described in Notes 3-d.i and 4-b.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the principle of uniformity in recognition and measurement. If a new standard amending existing measurement bases becomes applicable, it will be applied in accordance with the transition guidance provided in that standard.
Certain amounts in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated balance sheet were grouped together for the sake of clarity, and they are broken down in the corresponding notes to these consolidated financial statements.
15

The distinction presented in the consolidated balance sheet between current and non-current items was made on the basis of whether the assets and liabilities are to be realised or settled within one year or more.
In addition, the consolidated financial statements include all disclosures considered necessary for their correct presentation in accordance with the corporate legislation in force in Spain.
Lastly, the figures included in all the consolidated financial statements (consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows) and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of euros, unless it is explicitly stated that they are expressed in millions of euros.
e) Comparative information
As required by IFRSs, the information relating to the year ended 31 December 2018 contained in these consolidated financial statements for 2019 is presented for comparison purposes only. In this regard, as indicated in Note 1, in 2019 the Parent of the Group merged with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., and the main accounting effects of the merger are described in Nota 6. Since business combinations between group companies are specifically excluded from the scope of IFRS 3, and since the corporate transaction was a downstream merger (where the absorbing company for corporate law purposes is the subsidiary and the absorbed company for corporate law purposes is the parent), Abertis considered that the comparative information should be identified with the reporting entity resulting from the merger (i.e., Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.) and, therefore, the comparative information, included in these consolidated annual accounts, was not adjusted as a result of this transaction.
f) Materiality
In determining the information to disclose in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the various line items in the consolidated financial statements or on other matters, the Group took into consideration materiality with respect to these consolidated financial statements for 2019.
16

g) Basis of consolidation
i) Consolidation methods
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are the entities with respect to which Abertis directly or indirectly controls the financial and operating policies, exercises power over the relevant activities, has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of those returns. This is generally because it holds more than 50% of the voting power. Also, in order to assess whether Abertis controls another entity, the existence and the effect of the exercise or conversion of potential voting power is taken into consideration. The subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Abertis and are excluded from consolidation on the date that control ceases to exist.
The subsidiaries are fully consolidated.
In this connection, at 31 December 2019 and 2018 the Group fully consolidated Grupo Concesionario del Oeste, S.A. (Gco) and Autopistas del Sol, S.A. (Ausol) over which it exercises effective control despite directly holding 50% or less of the dividend and voting rights. Specifically, in accordance with the applicable accounting legislation, effective control of both Gco and Ausol is exercised as a result of the corporate and shareholder structure of these companies and of the fact that the historic quorums at these companies have afforded Abertis de facto control.
Abertis exercises effective control over the subgroup of which the consolidated company Arteris, S.A. (Arteris) is the parent, since Abertis exercises effective control over the consolidated company Partícipes en Brasil, S.A. (Partícipes, which holds a direct and indirect interest of 82.30% in Arteris, S.A.) as it holds a 51% ownership interest in the latter and by virtue of the shareholders agreement entered into with the other shareholder of the company, giving it decision-making capacity over relevant activities. Partícipes, as majority shareholder, has the capacity to appoint a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Arteris and, consequently, exercises control over the latter.
17

Also, Abertis exercises effective control over Túnels de Barcelona i Cadí, Concessionària de la Generalitat de Catalunya, S.A. (Túnels), Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico, LLC (Metropistas) and Autopista Trados 45, S.A. (Trados 45) (in the latter case, since 1 January 2019 (see Note 2.h). Such effective control is the result, on the one hand, of holding ownership interests of over 50%, specifically, 50.01% and 51% in the latter two cases, respectively, and, on the other, of the respective shareholders agreements entered into with the other shareholder of each company, which give Abertis decision-making capacity over the investees' relevant activities.
The information on all the consolidated subsidiaries at 31 December 2019 is detailed in Appendix I to these Notes.
Joint ventures (jointly controlled entities)
These are companies whose activities are jointly controlled with one or more third parties by virtue of a contractual arrangement and where the strategic financial and operating decisions related to that activity require the unanimous consent of all the parties sharing control.
The Group's interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 11 using the equity method as indicated in the section on "Associates" below.
The impairment of "Joint Ventures" is measured in the same way as that of "Associates" as described below.
Appendix II to these Notes provides the information on joint ventures (jointly controlled entities) accounted for using the equity method at 31 December 2019.
Associates
An associate is a company over which Abertis exercises significant influence and with which it has a long-term relationship that fosters and influences its activities even though it has limited representation in the management and control bodies which, in general, is accompanied by an ownership interest of between 20% and 50% of the voting power of the investee, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such influence does not exist or unless Abertis holds less than 20% of that power and it can be clearly demonstrated that said influence does exist.
18

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. Abertis's investments in associates include, in accordance with IAS 28, any goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment losses) identified on acquisition, recognised under "Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures" in the consolidated balance sheet.
In the case of associates acquired in stages, IAS 28 does not specifically define how to determine the related cost. Therefore, the Group takes the cost of an investment in an associate acquired in stages to be the sum of the amounts paid in each acquisition plus the share of the profits and other changes in equity less any impairment that may have arisen.
Following acquisition, Abertis's share of the profit or loss and reserves of associates is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year and as reserves of consolidated companies (other comprehensive income), respectively, with the value of the ownership interest as the balancing item in both cases. Dividends received and/or accrued after acquisition are adjusted against the amount of the investment.
If the Group's share of the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any receivables for which adequate collateral does not exist, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses, unless it has incurred obligations, provided guarantees or made payments on behalf of the associate.
If there are any indications of impairment, the investment will be tested for impairment, pursuant to IAS 36, as if it were an individual asset, by comparing its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. In order to determine the value in use of the net investment, an estimate will be made of: i) its share of the present value, discounted at a rate of the weighted average cost of capital, of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the associate or joint venture, including those from the operations of the associate or joint venture, and the amounts arising from the ultimate disposal of the investment; or ii) the present value, discounted at a rate corresponding to the cost of equity, of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise as dividends to be received from the investment and from its ultimate disposal. The application of either method should produce the same result.
The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or joint venture will be assessed for each associate or joint venture unless the associate or joint venture does not generate cash inflows as a result of its continuing use that are largely independent of the inflows from the Group's other assets.
19

The data relating to the associates accounted for using the equity method at 31 December 2019 are detailed in Appendix III to these Notes.
ii) Uniformity of timing and measurement
Except in the case of Trichy Tollway Private Limited (TTPL) and Jadcherla Expressways Private Limited (JEPL), whose annual reporting periods end on 31 March, the reporting date for all the companies included in the scope of consolidation is 31 December, and their respective financial statements for the year prepared in accordance with IFRSs were used for consolidation purposes. Under current legislation, these companies present either separate financial statements or consolidated financial statements for the subgroups of which they are the parents in accordance with the legislation applicable to them in their country of origin.
For consolidation purposes, in the specific case of TTPL and JEPL, timing uniformity adjustments were made, and the respective financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs for a year ended 31 December were used.
The accounting policies applied by the Group companies are essentially the same. However, wherever necessary, in order to ensure the uniformity of the accounting policies of the consolidated companies with the accounting policies applied by the Group, the appropriate adjustments were made.
iii) Goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase arising on first-time consolidation
The subsidiaries acquired by the Group are accounted for using the acquisition method provided for in IFRS 3. Acquisition cost is the fair value of the assets acquired, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date, plus any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which the transaction takes place.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially recognised at their acquisition-date fair value, including those attributable to non-controlling interests. For each business combination, the Group may choose to recognise any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at either fair value or the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.
20

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets identified in the transaction is recognised as goodwill arising on consolidation, which is allocated to the respective cash-generating unit (CGU).
Abertis carries out a provisional allocation of the cost of the business combination at the acquisition date which is remeasured, if appropriate, within the 12 months following the date on which control of the acquiree was obtained.
The resulting goodwill is allocated to the various CGUs to which the benefits of the business combination synergies are expected to flow, separately from any other assets or liabilities of the acquiree allocated to these units or groups of units.
However, if the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised as a gain directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill on consolidation is not amortised systematically but is rather tested for impairment annually, as indicated in Note 3-c.
In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, on gain of control the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the business acquired must be determined including the interest already held. The differences arising from the previously recognised assets and liabilities must be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
In the case of associates acquired in stages, goodwill is calculated for each acquisition based on the cost and the share of the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.
As indicated in Note 2-g.i, goodwill arising from acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is capitalised to the corresponding ownership interest and is measured as indicated in Note 3-b.iii.
21

iv) Elimination of intra-Group transactions
Intra-Group balances and transactions and gains not realised vis-à-vis third parties arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction evidences an impairment loss on the asset transferred.
Gains and losses arising from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are recognised in the Group's financial statements only to the extent that they arise from the interests of other investors in associates and joint ventures not related to the investor.
v) Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recognised as transactions with the Group's equity holders. Accordingly, in purchases of non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the proportionate share of the carrying amount of the net assets of the subsidiary is taken to equity. Similarly, gains or losses on disposals of non-controlling interests are also recognised in the Group's equity.
If the Group ceases to exercise significant influence or control, the investment retained is remeasured at its fair value and any gain or loss relative to the previously recognised investment is taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. In addition, any amount previously recognised as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to this entity is accounted for as if the Group had directly sold all the related assets and liabilities, which would give rise, where applicable, to the amounts previously recognised under "Other Comprehensive Income" being reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. If the decrease in the investment in an associate does not give rise to a loss of significant influence, the proportional share previously recognised in "Other Comprehensive Income" is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
22

vi) Translation of financial statements in currencies other than the euro
The financial statements of the foreign companies presented in a functional currency (that of the main economic area in which the entity operates) other than the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements (the euro) are generally translated to euros using the year-end exchange rate method, whereby:
 Equity is translated at the historical exchange rate;  Income and expense items are translated using the average exchange
rate for the year as an approximation to the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date;  The other balance sheet items are translated using the year-end exchange rate.
The exchange differences generated as a result of applying the aforementioned method are included under "Reserves - Translation Differences" in equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Translation of financial statements in currencies other than the euro - entities and branches located in hyperinflationary economies
In accordance with IAS 29, in order to assess whether an economy is a hyperinflationary economy, the characteristics of the economic environment of a country are analysed to assess whether certain circumstances exist, such as whether the general population prefers to keep its wealth or savings in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency, whether prices may be quoted in that currency, whether interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index or whether the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%. The existence of certain of these circumstances does not in itself establish the need for an economy to be considered to be hyperinflationary, although it does provide certain elements of judgment for its determination as such.
In this regard, on the basis of these criteria, in the third quarter of 2018 the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary. Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned IAS 29, at 31 December 2019 and 2018 it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of the Group companies located in Argentina (Ausol and Gco) in order to express them in terms of the measuring current unit at the end of the reporting period and adjust them for the effects of inflation.
23

As required by IAS 29, monetary items (mainly cash and accounts receivable) were not restated, whereas non-monetary items (mainly non-current assets and equity) were restated on the basis of the change in the Argentine CPI.
As a result of the application of the aforementioned IAS 29, the cumulative historical differences between the restated costs and the previous costs of the non-monetary items at 31 December 2017, which amounted to EUR 161 million (EUR 57 million corresponding to Abertis and EUR 104 million to noncontrolling interests) were recognised with a credit to "Foreign Currency Translation Differences" and "Non-Controlling Interests" in consolidated equity effective for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018.
The differences relating to the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, together with the restatement of profit, were recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the corresponding year, after taking into account the effect of the merger described in Notes 1 and 6.
Therefore, as stated above, the financial statements of the Argentine consolidated Group companies, whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy as indicated above, were translated to the presentation currency using the closing rate, as required by IAS 21.42.
vii) Other
Exchange differences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign operation and of loans and other instruments in a currency other than the euro designated as hedges of those investments are recognised in equity. When the investment is sold, those exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a component of the gain or loss on the sale.
Adjustments to goodwill and to the fair value of assets and liabilities that arise on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the year-end exchange rate.
24

h) Changes in the scope of consolidation i) Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2019 The main changes in the scope of consolidation in the year ended 31 December 2019 were as follows:
 As described in Note 7, on 12 February 2019 Abertis reached an agreement with Red Eléctrica Corporación for the sale of the Group's 89.68% holding in Hispasat, the satellite telecommunications business discontinued in prior years. Once all the requisite administrative authorisations had been obtained, the sale was completed on 3 October 2019 for EUR 933 million, with no significant effect on equity arising from the divestment.
 Abertis acquired from Finavias, S.a r.l. an additional holding of 1% in Autopista Trados 45, S.A. (Trados) for EUR 4.8 million, as a result of which Abertis (through its investee Iberpistas, S.A.) became the majority and controlling shareholder of this company with an ownership interest of 51% and, therefore, Autopista Trados 45, S.A. started to be fully consolidated (it had hitherto been accounted for using the equity method) and its assets and liabilities were included in the consolidated financial statements at their previously existing carrying amounts, without considering the control premium paid, which were considered to reflect the fair value of the related concession infrastructure.
The summary of these changes and the detail of other changes in the year ended 31 December 2019 that did not have a significant impact are as follows:

ii) Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2018
In the year ended 31 December 2018 there were no significant changes in the scope of consolidation. The detail of the most significant changes in the percentages of ownership of consolidated companies is as follows:
 On 16 January 2018, the acquisition from the Provincia di Verona and Provincia di Vicenza Governments of 6.47% of the share capital of A4 holding, S.p.A. (A4) for EUR 33 million was completed. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis held 90.03% of A4 (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Internacional, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 28 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent.
 As indicated in Note 20.ii to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, at 31 December 2017 the Group had recognised two commitments to purchase shares of JEPL and Hispasat from third-party shareholders for EUR 14 million (for 26% of the shares of JEPL) and EUR 302 million (for 33.69% of the shares of Hispasat), respectively, which were honoured in the first half of 2018. Thus: o On 27 March 2018, the acquisition from the funds Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte. Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust of 26% of the share capital of JEPL for EUR 15 million was completed. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis held 100% of JEPL (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Internacional, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this company did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 8 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent.
27

o The acquisition from Eutelsat, S.A. of 32.63% (lower than the 33.69% indicated as a result of the exercise of the right of proration of thirdparty shareholders of Hispasat) of the share capital of Hispasat for EUR 293 million was completed on 18 April 2018. With the acquisition of this additional shareholding, Abertis held 89.68% of Hispasat (through its wholly owned Spanish subsidiary Abertis Telecom Satélites, S.A.). In this regard, the purchase transaction carried out was recognised as a transaction with non-controlling interests, since the position of control already held by Abertis over this subgroup did not change, which gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 378 million on the reserves attributable to the shareholders of the Parent and, in relation to the percentage of ownership not acquired on which Eutelsat, S.A. had been granted a put option, in accordance with IAS 23.32, since it expired without being exercised, a positive impact of EUR 9 million was recognised in the Group's equity.
 In 2018, as described in Note 7.ii to the consolidated financial statements for 2018, the Group completed the sale of the entire ownership interest that it held in Cellnex at 31 December 2017 (34% of its share capital).
The summary of these changes and the detail of other changes in the year ended 31 December 2018 that did not have a significant impact are as follows:

Also, it should be noted in relation to the consolidated company Gco that on 8 November 2018 the Group, as required by the Argentine National Securities Market Commission, set up a trust for 5.73% of the investment in that company, establishing in the agreement, among other aspects, the assignment to the nominee shareholder of the voting and dividend rights associated with the ownership interest assigned.

29

In this regard, on 27 November 2018, after receiving the required authorisation from the National Highway Administration of Argentina (Dirección Nacional de Vialidad de Argentina), the Group subsidiary Acesa sold 9,160,136 of its Class A shares, representing 5.73% of its dividend rights and 7.58% of its voting rights, to TMF Trust Company (Argentina), S.A. ("TMF"). From the legal standpoint, the voting and dividend rights corresponding to the shares were transferred irrevocably to TMF and, accordingly, Acesa's voting rights at Gco were reduced from the 57.7% it had held to 49.99%. TMF is an independent international nominee shareholder that belongs to the TMF Group and, as such, was responsible for transferring the aforementioned shares of Gco to one or several possible interested third parties.
From the accounting standpoint, and in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group, on the one hand, the current position of control was reassessed, pursuant to IFRS 10, and it was concluded that de facto control was still held and, on the other, taking into account the terms of the agreement with TMF, the transfer was not considered to be a derecognition for accounting purposes since economic risks relating to the sale price of the shares had been retained. In connection with these transactions, at 31 December 2019 TMF kept opened the process of searching for a buyer of the shares in GCO at a price that reflects the valuation made by its independent financial advisor.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (EU-IFRSs) and the interpretations in force when the consolidated financial statements were prepared, were as follows:
a) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less the accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Grants related to assets received reduce the cost of acquisition of property, plant and equipment and are recognised when the entity complies with the conditions attaching to their collection. They are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed, reducing the depreciation charge for the year.
30

Staff costs and other expenses, as well as net borrowing costs directly attributable to property, plant and equipment, are capitalised as part of the acquisition cost until the assets are ready for their intended use.

The costs of renewal, expansion or improvement of items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised to the asset only when this leads to increased capacity or productivity or to a lengthening of the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and provided that it is possible to ascertain or estimate the carrying amount of the items that are derecognised because they have been replaced.

Upkeep and maintenance costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they are incurred.

The investment in infrastructure recognised by concession operators in property, plant and equipment relates to assets over which the concession grantor does not retain control (i.e., assets not owned by the concession grantor given that it does not control any residual interest at the end of the term of the arrangement), but which are necessary for the operation and management of the infrastructure. This infrastructure includes mainly buildings used in operations, toll facilities and materials and videosurveillance equipment, etc.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated systematically using the straight-line method over the useful life of the assets, based on the actual decline in value caused by their use and wear and tear.

The depreciation rates used to calculate the depreciation of the various items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Item
Buildings and other structures Machinery Tools Other fixtures Furniture Computer hardware Other items of property, plant and equipment Other toll road management assets:
Toll facilities Toll machinery Other

Depreciation rate
2-15 % 5-30 % 5-30 % 5-20 % 10-20 % 20-33 % 8-25 %
6-12 % 6-12 % 10-20 %

31

When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, its carrying amount is reduced immediately to its recoverable amount, and the impact is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Gains and losses arising from the sale or retirement of assets of this nature are determined as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its selling price and are recognised under "Other Income" or "Other Expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss.
b) Goodwill and other intangible assets
The intangible assets indicated below are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, and their useful life is evaluated on the basis of prudent estimates. Grants related to assets received reduce the cost of acquisition of intangible assets and are recognised when the entity complies with the conditions attaching to their collection. They are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed and reduce the amortisation charge for the year.
The carrying amount of intangible assets is reviewed for possible impairment when certain events or changes indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
i) Computer software
Computer software relates mainly to the amounts paid for title to or the right to use computer programs, only when the software is expected to be used over several years.
It is stated at acquisition cost and is amortised over its useful life (between three and five years). Computer software maintenance costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they are incurred.
32

ii) Administrative concessions
"Administrative Concessions" in the consolidated balance sheet includes mainly concession arrangements for the construction and operation of various toll road networks, within the scope of IFRIC 12, as well as concessions acquired directly or as part of a business combination.
In this connection, IFRIC 12 governs the treatment of public-to-private service concession arrangements when:
 the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and
 the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.
In general, a distinction must be drawn between two clearly different phases: the first, in which the operator provides and/or subcontracts construction or upgrade services which are recognised as intangible or financial assets by reference to the stage of completion; and a second phase, in which the concession operator provides a series of maintenance and/or operation services in relation to the aforementioned infrastructure.
In these concession arrangements, the operator acts as a service provider; specifically, on the one hand, providing infrastructure construction and upgrade services and, on the other, providing operation and maintenance services over the term of the arrangement. The consideration received for these services is recognised according to the type of contractual right received:
 When the right to charge a price to the users of the public service is received and this right is not unconditional but is rather contingent on the extent to which the users actually use the service, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as an intangible asset under "Other Intangible Assets - Administrative Concessions", using the intangible asset model, in which the demand risk is borne by the concession operator. This model applies to the great majority of the Group's toll road concession operators.
33

 When an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from (or on behalf of) the grantor is received, and the grantor has little or no discretion to avoid payment, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as a financial asset under "Other Financial Assets - Concession Arrangements - Financial Assets" (see Note 3-d.ii), using the financial asset model, in which the concession operator does not bear any demand risk (it is paid even if the infrastructure is not used, given that the grantor guarantees the concession operator that it will pay a fixed or determinable amount or cover any shortfall). This model is not extensively applied within the Group.
 When there is a combination of the two aforementioned arrangements, the bifurcated model is applied to each component of the arrangement.
The model applicable to most of the main concessions operated by the Group (see Note 27-c) is the intangible asset model, since the consideration received generally consists of the right to charge users a fee for the use of the public service and the fee depends on users' effective use thereof. In the case of the consolidated companies Elqui, Libertadores and A4 (the latter as a result of the investments made indicated in Nota 9-iv), it was considered that the concession model applicable is that of both a financial asset and an intangible asset (bifurcated), since the consideration received consists, on the one hand, of the unconditional right to receive an asset from the grantor in the form of either grants or guaranteed minimum revenue, and, on the other, it is paid through a payment system based on the use of the infrastructure.
Intangible asset model
Administrative concessions are generally recognised as assets measured at the total amount of the payments made to obtain them, which includes the costs directly allocable to construction incurred until they are ready for use (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services, project execution, project management and administration expenses, installation work and building construction and similar costs) and the related portion of other indirectly allocable costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction phase.
Cost also includes the borrowing costs incurred before the assets are ready for their intended use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects. These capitalised borrowing costs arise from the funds borrowed specifically for the acquisition of an asset.
34

For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and restoration and any work to upgrade the infrastructure or increase its capacity the revenue from which is provided for in the initial contract are capitalised at the start of the concession and the amortisation of these assets and the interest cost relating to the provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also, provisions for the costs to be incurred in replacing and repairing the infrastructure are systematically recognised in profit or loss as the corresponding obligation is incurred.
Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the assets or an increase in their production capacity are expensed currently.
Administrative concessions acquired through business combinations are measured, in accordance with IFRS 3, at fair value (obtained from valuations based on the analysis of cash flows discounted to present value at the date of acquisition) and are amortised over the concession term, as described below.
Administrative concessions have a finite useful life and their cost, if recognised as an intangible asset, is recognised in profit or loss through its amortisation over the concession term. In this regard, in order to choose the amortisation method to be used from among those provided for in IAS 38.98 (the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method), the directors consider which method best reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits associated with the administrative concessions are expected to be consumed by the Group, and that method is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.
In this connection, since 1 November 2018, in the framework of the gain of control of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by new shareholders (see Note 15a), the directors have considered, on the basis of the available information and the future outlook for the business, that the amortisation method that best reflects the pattern of consumption of future economic benefits for the administrative concessions in Brazil, Chile and India is the units of production method which, in the case of toll roads, is usually measured in terms of traffic. Therefore, since that date, the aforementioned administrative concessions have been amortised, prospectively, on the basis of projected traffic, while the straight-line method continues to be used for the rest of the Group's assets, as the result does not differ significantly from that of using the units of production method based on traffic.
35

Lastly, it is periodically determined (at least at each reporting date) whether there is any indication that an asset or group of assets might have become impaired so that an impairment loss can be recognised or reversed in order to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their recoverable amount.
iii) Goodwill
Goodwill generated in various business combinations represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the acquisition-date fair or market value of all the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
Since goodwill is considered to be an asset of the acquiree, in the case of a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the euro, goodwill is stated in the subsidiary's functional currency and is translated to euros using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, as indicated in Note 2-g.vii.
Any impairment of goodwill recognised separately (that of subsidiaries) is reviewed annually through an impairment test to determine whether its value has been reduced to below its carrying amount at the date of the test and, if so, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year (see Notes 3-c and 9). An impairment loss recognised for goodwill must not be reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill included in the carrying amount of investments in associates and interests in jointly controlled entities is not tested for impairment separately, but rather, pursuant to IAS 36, whenever there is an indication that the investment may have become impaired, the total carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. The loss or gain on the sale of an entity includes the carrying amount of the goodwill relating to it.
36

iv) Other intangible assets
At 31 December 2018, the other intangible assets related mainly to those associated with managing satellite telecommunications infrastructure that arose as a result of the gain of control over Hispasat in November 2013. These intangible assets related to the use of current orbital positions owned by Hispasat and to business relationships with customers, which at 2018 year-end (as at 2017 year-end) are classified under "Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 7).
At 31 December 2019, they related mainly to those associated with contractual relationships with customers that the Group company Bip&Go, S.A. has in its commercial transactions with customers and which arose as a result of the business combination described in Note 6.
The aforementioned contractual relationships are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at their acquisition-date fair value, obtained from valuations based on the analysis of cash flows discounted to present value at the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. Based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, management of Abertis considers that there is a foreseeable limit to the period over which these relationships are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group, as a result of which these relationships were classified as an intangible asset with a finite useful life. Therefore, they are being amortised at an annual rate of 5% over a useful life of 20 years.
c) Impairment losses on non-financial assets
At each reporting date, or whenever there is any indication of impairment, the Group assesses the recoverable amount of its assets. If any such indication exists, or when an annual impairment test has to be performed (in the case of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing the recoverable amount of an asset, the estimated future cash inflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects, inter alia, the long-term time value of money and the risks specific to the asset and, where applicable, any costs of disposal.
37

Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets (the case of goodwill), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets) to which the asset belongs. If a cashgenerating unit becomes impaired, the carrying amount of any goodwill assigned to it is written down first, followed by that of the other assets in proportion to each asset's carrying amount with respect to the total carrying amount of the cash-generating unit.
Impairment losses (carrying amount of the asset higher than its recoverable amount) are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
With the exception of goodwill, the impairment losses on which are irreversible, at each reporting date, if the Group has recognised impairment losses on assets in prior years, it is assessed whether there are indications that such losses have ceased to exist or have been reduced, and, where appropriate, the recoverable amount of the impaired asset is estimated.
An impairment loss recognised in prior years is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of an asset since the most recent impairment loss was recognised. If an impairment loss is reversed, the carrying amount of the related asset is increased to its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
d) Financial assets (excluding derivative financial instruments)
When initially recognising financial assets, the Group measures them at fair value, adjusted (in the case of a financial asset that is not recognised at fair value through profit or loss) by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase or issue thereof. Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition of an asset classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised directly in profit or loss.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value, depending on their classification.
38

1. Classification and measurement of financial assets
Financial assets are classified on initial recognition in the following categories:
i) Debt instruments classified as at amortised cost: when these instruments relate to debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, they are, in general, measured at amortised cost.
ii) Debt instruments classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income: when these debt instruments are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows (payments of principal and interest) and selling financial assets, they are, in general, measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
iii) Equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income: these are equity instruments for which the Group makes an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.
iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: debt and equity instruments that do not meet the conditions for being classified in one or other of the aforementioned categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
In this regard, at 31 December 2019 (as at 2018 year-end) the Group did not have any debt instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
i) Debt instruments classified as at amortised cost
These include both loans granted and accounts receivable (see Note 13) and other financial assets (see Notes 11 and 13) held within this business model and, therefore, they are measured at amortised cost. In this category the Group classifies mainly:
 Accounts receivable resulting from the application of the bifurcated model when accounting for certain concession arrangements falling within the scope of IFRIC 12.
 Trade receivables, the amortised cost of which does not differ significantly from their nominal value or their fair value on initial recognition.
39

 Loans to associates, joint ventures and related companies.
 Deposits and guarantees, the amortised cost of which does not differ significantly from their nominal value.
The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is its amortised cost, before adjusting for any loss allowance.
The effective interest method is a method that is used in the calculation of the amortised cost of a debt instrument and in the allocation of the interest revenue or interest expense in profit or loss over the relevant period:
 Financial assets that are not purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets (i.e., assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition): the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts (including all transaction costs), excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument or, where applicable, a shorter period.
 Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets: the creditadjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including any expected credit losses, to the cost of the debt instrument on initial recognition.
Interest revenue is calculated by using the effective interest method for debt instruments subsequently measured at amortised cost:
 Financial assets that are not purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets: interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, except in the case of those that subsequently have become credit-impaired financial assets. For those financial assets, interest revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves to that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.
40

 Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets: the Group recognises interest revenue by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The calculation does not return to the gross carrying amount even if the credit risk on the financial asset subsequently improves to that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired.
ii) Equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income
These include the equity instruments detailed in Note 11 as the Group has made this irrevocable election.
As indicated above, at initial recognition the Group can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Such designation is not permitted if the investment is held for trading or corresponds to contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. In this regard, a financial asset is held for trading if: i) it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; ii) it is, on initial recognition, part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or iii) it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument).
Investments in equity instruments designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair value plus the related transaction costs. In this regard, fair value is determined as described in Note 12.
They are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal, but is rather transferred to accumulated reserves.
Dividends on these equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payment of the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
41

2. Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments measured at amortised cost or, if it has any, on investments in debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and on lease receivables, trade receivables, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts.
The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial instrument in question.
The Group always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables. Expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted where necessary by factors that are specific to the borrower, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including the time value of money where appropriate.
For all other financial instruments, including financial assets arising from the application of the IFRIC 12 financial asset model, the Group recognises the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument using the general criterion, i.e., recognition of the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
i) Significant increase in credit risk
When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on a financial instrument since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. When making such an assessment, the Group considers reasonable and supportable quantitative and qualitative information, including historical credit loss experience.
42

ii) Definition of default
The Group considers, among other factors, whether the debtor has defaulted on its financial obligations and whether the available information indicates that it is probable that the latter will not be able to settle its borrowings in full, in order to assess whether there has been a default event for credit risk management purposes.
In any case, the Group considers that a default event has occurred when a financial asset has been a significant period of time past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate on the basis of the asset analysed.
iii) Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred.
iv) Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses
Expected credit losses are measured on the basis of the probability of default, the loss given default and exposure at default. The probability of default and the loss given default are measured on the basis of historical information adjusted by forward-looking information. Exposure to credit losses, for financial assets, is represented by the gross carrying amount of the assets at the reporting date.
For financial assets, an expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for this lifetime expected credit loss measurement are no longer met, it estimates the expected credit loss at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses at the current reporting date, except for assets for which the simplified approach was used.
43

The Group recognises impairment gains or losses on all financial instruments with the concomitant adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance for expected credit losses account.
v) Impairment policy
The Group derecognises a financial asset when it has information that indicates that the debtor is in a highly adverse financial situation and there is no reasonable prospect of recovering any further cash flows, for example, when the debtor has initiated a liquidation process or, in the case of trade receivables, when they have been past due for a very significant length of time. Financial assets derecognised may still be subject to the Group's recovery operations. Any recovery of a derecognised asset is recognised in profit or loss.
3. Exchange gains and losses on financial assets
The carrying amount of financial assets denominated in foreign currency (with respect to each Group company that owns such assets) is determined in that foreign currency and is translated to euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Specifically:
 In the case of financial assets measured at amortised cost that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
 In the case of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the investment revaluation reserve.
4. Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have also been transferred. However, the Group does not derecognise financial assets, and recognises a financial liability for an amount equal to the consideration received, in transfers of financial assets in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained.
44

e) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its financial risk arising mainly from fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (see Note 4). These derivative financial instruments, whether classified as hedges or not, were recognised either at fair value (both at the initial time and in subsequent valuations), which is the market value at the reporting date for quoted instruments, or using valuations based on an analysis of discounted cash flows using assumptions based mainly on the market conditions at the reporting date for unquoted derivative instruments.
All derivative financial instruments must be recognised as an asset or as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value must be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year, unless, opting for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the hedging relationship has to be recognised in equity (fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a currency other than the euro).
At the inception of the hedge, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and the strategy for undertaking various hedges. The Group also documents how it will assess, both initially and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in the hedges are highly effective for offsetting changes in fair value or in the cash flows attributable to the hedged items.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes is disclosed in Note 12, and the change in the related valuation adjustments recognised in consolidated equity is disclosed in Note 15.
Hedge accounting, where applicable, is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Classification of financial instruments as current or non-current in the consolidated balance sheet depends on whether at year-end the hedging relationship expires at less than or more than one year.
45

The criteria used to account for these instruments are as follows:
i) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of designated derivatives that meet the conditions to be classified as fair value hedges of assets or liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year under "Changes in Fair Value of Financial Instruments", together with any change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk. These relate primarily to the derivative financial instruments arranged by the Group companies to convert fixed-rate borrowings into floating-rate borrowings.
ii) Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the measurement of derivatives classified as cash flow hedges, net of the related tax effect, is recognised in consolidated equity under "Reserves - Valuation Adjustments Relating to Hedges" until the hedged item affects profit or loss (or when the underlying matures or is sold or it is no longer probable that the transaction will take place), at which point the accumulated gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of derivatives is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year under "Changes in Fair Value of Financial Instruments".
These hedges relate mainly to derivative financial instruments arranged by Group companies to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.
iii) Hedge of a net investment in a currency other than the euro
With the aim of reducing the exchange rate risk, Abertis can finance some of its foreign investments in the same functional currency in which they are denominated. This is done by obtaining financing in the corresponding currency or by entering into cross currency interest rate swaps.
46

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity, while the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
Accumulated gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on disposal of the foreign investment.
iv) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
v) Fair value and fair valuation measurement techniques
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are based on a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 or 3) depending on the degree to which inputs are observable and the importance of each input to the fair value measurement as a whole, as described below:
 Level 1 - These inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 - These inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (not included in Level 1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and techniques based on valuation models for which all the significant inputs are observable in the market or may be corroborated by observable market data.
 Level 3 - The inputs are generally observable and, in general terms, they reflect estimates of the market assumptions for determining the price of the asset or liability. The unobservable data used in the pricing models are significant with respect to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
47

In accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a bilateral credit risk adjustment in the fair value of the derivatives in order to reflect both own risk and counterparty risk.
To determine the fair value of its derivatives, the Group uses valuation techniques based on expected total exposure (which includes both current exposure and potential exposure) adjusted for the probability of default and loss given default of each counterparty.
The total expected exposure of the derivatives is obtained by using observable market inputs, such as interest rate, exchange rate and volatility curves based on the market conditions at the measurement date. The inputs used for the probability of own default and default of the counterparties are estimated on the basis of the credit default swap (CDS) prices observed in the market.
Also, to adjust fair value for credit risk, the 40% market standard, which corresponds to the CDS on senior corporate debt, was applied as the recovery rate.
f) Inventories
Inventories consist mainly of spare parts for non-current assets and are measured at cost, which is calculated using the weighted average cost formula. The necessary valuation adjustments are made and the corresponding write-downs are recognised.
g) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. In this connection, by virtue of the concession arrangements and/or financing agreements of certain of the Group's concession operators, a portion of the balance is subject to certain conditions of use, even if, in light of the nature of these arrangements, their classification has been maintained.
48

h) Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
i) Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount obtained from the application of the relevant measurement basis in each case and fair value less costs of disposal.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if it is estimated that their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met when the sale of the asset is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification of the asset as held for sale.
ii) Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
 represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
 is part of a single, co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
When an operation meets the criteria to be classified as discontinued, the Group discloses in a single line item the post-tax profit or loss of that discontinued operation, including the possible loss recognised on its measurement at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal, and the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. This condition is regarded as met when the sale of the asset is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification of the asset as held for sale, although an extension of the period required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset from being classified as held for sale if the criteria provided for in IFRS 5 are met.
49

i) Treasury shares
If any Group company or the Parent acquires treasury shares of Abertis, those shares are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under "Treasury Shares", and they are deducted from consolidated equity and measured at their acquisition cost without recognising any valuation adjustment.
When these shares are sold, any amount received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and of the related tax effect, is included in equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent.
j) Financial liabilities
When initially recognising financial liabilities, the Group measures them at fair value, adjusted (in the case of a financial liability that is not recognised at fair value through profit or loss) by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue thereof. Transaction costs attributable to the issue of a liability classified as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised directly in profit or loss.
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
i) Financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost
Financial liabilities that are not: i) contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination; ii) financial liabilities held for trading; or iii) financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see Note 3-d).
The effective interest method is used in the calculation of the amortised cost of a financial liability and in the allocation of the interest expense over the expected life of the financial liability at amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including transaction costs) through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
50

Fixed-rate borrowings hedged with derivatives that change the interest rate from fixed to floating are measured at the fair value of the hedged item, and any changes therein are recognised in profit or loss, thereby offsetting the impact on profit or loss of the change in the fair value of the derivative.
ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is:
a) contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination;
b) held for trading; or c) designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
In this regard, a financial liability is classified as held for trading if: i) it is incurred principally with an intention to repurchase it in the near term; ii) it is, on initial recognition, part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or iii) it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.
A financial liability that is not a financial liability held for trading or contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination may be designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if: i) this designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; ii) the financial liability is part of a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities that is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy of the Group, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis; or iii) is part of a contract that contains one or more embedded derivatives, and IFRS 9 permits the designation of the entire hybrid contract as at fair value through profit or loss.
51

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and any gain or loss arising from changes in its fair value are recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the item is not part of a designated hedging relationship. In this regard, a change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income unless such treatment creates an accounting mismatch, and they are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss (they are transferred to reserves if the financial liability is derecognised).
Gains and losses on financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss.
iii) Derecognition and/or modification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligations giving rise to them cease to exist.
Also, when debt instruments are exchanged between the Group and a third party and the various terms and conditions differ substantially, the Group derecognises the original financial liability and recognises the new one. The difference between the carrying amount of the original financial liability and the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, is recognised in profit or loss. In this regard, the Group considers that the terms and conditions of financial liabilities do not differ substantially whenever the lender in the new loan is the same as that which granted the original loan, the characteristics of the financial liability do not differ significantly from those of the original liability and the present value of the discounted cash flows, as per the new terms and conditions, including any fees and commissions paid, net of any fees and commissions received and using the original effective interest rate to discount the liability, does not differ by more than 10% from the discounted present value of the cash flows of the original financial liability that remain outstanding.
Changes in the contractual cash flows of a financial liability not leading to the derecognition of the financial liability must be recognised as a change in estimate of the contractual cash flows of the liability, maintaining the original effective interest rate and adjusting its carrying amount at the date of the change, and the related modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
52

k) Income tax
The income tax expense (tax income), comprises current tax expense (current tax income) and deferred tax expense (deferred tax income).
Both the current and deferred income tax expense (tax income) are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year. However, the tax effect relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.
Deferred taxes are calculated using the balance sheet liability method based on the temporary differences that arise between the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, using the tax laws and tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and which are expected to apply when the corresponding deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities that arise from temporary differences associated with the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and/or associates are always recognised, unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that the Group will have future taxable profits against which it will be able to offset the deductible temporary differences or the unused tax losses or other tax assets. Any deferred tax assets that arise due to temporary differences associated with the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and/or associates are recognised if, in addition, it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed when they arise, and at the end of each reporting period, based on the earnings performance projected in the companies' respective business plans.
53

The Parent Company, and its tax group in Spain, are taxed in the tax consolidation regime of the Corporation Tax, forming part of the Tax Consolidation Group whose dominant company is the majority shareholder of the Parent Company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A. In this sense, taking into account the legal-private relationship of the consolidation agreement, the Parent Company, and its tax group records the respective accounts receivable or payable for the Corporation Tax for the year as a debit or credit against Abertis HoldCo, S.A.
Lastly, the tax effect that may arise as a result of including the results and reserves of the subsidiaries in the Parent's equity is not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since, pursuant to IAS 12, it is considered that no transfers of reserves giving rise to additional taxation will be made. Since the Parent controls the timing of distribution, it is not probable that such distribution will occur in the foreseeable future, but rather that the results and reserves will be used as financing resources at each company.
l) Employee benefits
Under the respective collective agreements, various Group companies have the following obligations to employees:
i) Post-employment obligations:
Defined contribution obligations
In relation to defined contribution employee benefit instruments (which basically include employee pension plans and group insurance policies), the Group makes fixed contributions to a separate entity and does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the entity does not hold sufficient assets to pay the employee benefits. Consequently, the obligations under plans of this nature are limited to the payment of the contributions, the annual expense of which is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year as the payments are made.
Defined benefit obligations
Defined benefit obligations relate mainly to obligations in the form of bonuses or retirement benefits and temporary and/or life-time annuities, and a medical plan for retired former employees.
54

Where the company assumes certain actuarial and investment risks, the liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet is the present value of the obligations at the reporting date less the fair value of any plan assets at that date not arranged with related parties.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit obligations is conducted annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method to determine both the present value of the obligations and the related current and past service costs. The actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions are recognised in the year in which they occur, and are not presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss but rather in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
ii) Other long-term benefits
In relation to other long-term employee benefits relating mainly to employees' length of service at the company, the liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet coincides with the present value of the obligations at the reporting date, as there are no plan assets in this connection.
The projected unit credit method is used to determine both the present value of the obligations at the reporting date and the related current and past service costs. The actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions -unlike the case of the post-employment obligationsare recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in which they arise.
In addition, the Group has obligations to certain employees in relation to a medium-term incentive plan ("2019-2021 Incentive Plan") tied to the degree of achievement of certain business objectives. The cost of the plan is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss as staff costs on an accrual basis based on the probability that the objectives established will be fulfilled.
iii) Employee termination plan obligations
Provisions for obligations relating to plans for the termination of the employment relationship of certain employees (such as early retirement or other forms of employment termination) are calculated individually based on the terms agreed upon with the employees, which, in certain cases, may require actuarial valuations to be made, based on both demographic and financial assumptions.
55

m) Transactions in currencies other than the euro
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the Group's presentation currency (the euro) using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange gains and losses arising on settlement of these transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, unless they are deferred in equity, as in the case of cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (see Note 3-e).
Note that, in compliance with the provisions of Royal Decree 1558/2012 of November 15, the Group shows that the obligation of information on accounts in financial entities located abroad is fulfilled by the individualized record, in accessory accounting documents, of accounts opened abroad duly identified and accounted for consistently with the consolidated annual accounts.
n) Provisions and contingencies
At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the Group differentiated between:
 Provisions: credit balances covering present obligations at the reporting date arising from past events which could give rise to a loss for the Group, which is certain as to its nature but uncertain as to its amount and/or timing.
 Contingent liabilities: possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the consolidated companies.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of past events with respect to which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount thereof can be estimated reliably.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is determined to be the present value of the future cash flows estimated to be necessary to settle the present obligation.
56

The provisions recognised relate to the estimated amounts required for probable or certain liability arising from litigation in process, indemnity payments or other liabilities derived from the Group's business activities that will lead to future payments, which were measured on the basis of the information currently available. These provisions are recognised when the third-party liability or obligation giving rise to the indemnity or payment arises, taking into consideration the other conditions established by IFRSs.
For infrastructure concessions subject to the concession operator's fulfilment of contractual obligations, such as maintaining a certain level of serviceability of the infrastructure or restoring the infrastructure to a certain condition before handing it over to the grantor at the end of the service arrangement, the related provisions are recognised, in accordance with IAS 37, on the basis of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.
o) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in such a way as to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, IFRS 15 establishes a revenue recognition approach based on five steps:
 Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.  Step 3: Determine the transaction price.  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract.  Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation.
In this connection, revenue is recognised as an entity satisfies the obligations, i.e., when the "control" of the goods or services underlying the obligation in question is transferred to the customer.
Interest revenue is generally accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, as described in Note 3-d in relation to the measurement of financial assets.
57

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established, i.e., when the shareholders at the General Meetings of the investees approve the distribution of the related dividends.
Following the discontinuation of the satellite telecommunications business at the end of 2017, as detailed in Note 7, substantially all of the Group's revenue is now generated by its toll roads segment and relates primarily to toll revenue, which is recognised, in accordance with the recognition criterion described above, when the service is provided (as is the case for non-core income).
Lastly, it should be noted that although the Abertis Group does not generally carry on activities related to the construction of concession assets, since it incorporates the infrastructure that it operates under administrative concession arrangements by acquiring it from third-party companies that construct it on behalf of Abertis, in accordance with IFRIC 12.14, "Infrastructure Upgrade Revenue" and "Infrastructure Upgrade Expenses" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year include the revenue and expenses relating to the infrastructure construction or upgrade services provided in the year, including capitalised borrowing costs, and the infrastructure is recognised at fair value.
In this regard, "Infrastructure Upgrade Revenue" includes the borrowing costs incurred before the concession infrastructure is ready for its intended use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the infrastructure.
Also, revenue and expenses associated with concession infrastructure classified as financial assets relating to the provision of operation and maintenance services (application of the IFRIC 12 financial asset model) are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with the general recognition criterion, and the finance costs relating to the concession are recognised in the accompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss according to their nature.
58

p) Leases
In accordance with IFRS 16, at inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.
Therefore, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognised for all the leases in which the Group acts as the lessee, except for short-term leases (leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For such leases, the Group recognises the associated lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis either over the lease term or on another systematic basis. The Group applies another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern of its benefit.
At 2019 year-end the main operating leases related to the properties at which the Group companies carry on their activities, and the Group had not contracted with tenants for significant minimum lease payments.
q) Activities affecting the environment
Each year, payments made in order to comply with legal environmental requirements are either recognised as an expense or an investment, depending on their nature. The amounts capitalised are amortised over the years of useful life of the related asset.
It was not considered necessary to recognise any provisions for environmental contingencies and charges, since there are no contingencies relating to the protection of the environment.
r) Related party transactions
The Group performs all its transactions with related parties on an arm's length basis. Also, the transfer prices are adequately supported and, therefore, it is considered that there are no material risks in this connection that might give rise to significant liabilities in the future.
59

s) Consolidated statements of cash flows
The following terms are used in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the meanings specified:
 Cash flows are inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.  Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of
the Group and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.  Investing activities relate to the acquisition and disposal of longterm assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.  Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and borrowings of the Group.
For the purpose of preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows, "Cash and Cash Equivalents" were considered to be cash on hand, demand bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Lastly, in relation to the provisions required under IFRIC 12 charged to profit or loss and the infrastructure upgrade services, since the latter relate to investments to replace and upgrade concession assets operated by Abertis, the former were included in the cash flows from investing activities.
4. FINANCIAL RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
a) Financial risk factors
The Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks, the most significant being foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and inflation risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risks.
Financial risk management is controlled by management of the Financial Area, subject to authorisation from the CEO of Abertis, in the framework of the corresponding policy approved by the Board of Directors.
60

i) Foreign currency risk
The Group also operates outside the euro zone and owns assets basically in South America, Puerto Rico and India; therefore, it is exposed to foreign currency risk in foreign currency transactions, especially in relation to the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Argentine peso, the US dollar and the Indian rupee. Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency risk on the net assets in the Group's transactions in currencies other than the euro is managed in accordance with the policies defined using, where appropriate, borrowings denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies and/or cross currency interest rate swaps.
The foreign currency risk hedging strategy in investments in currencies other than euro should comply with what is established in the interest rate and foreign rate risk policy.
In relation to foreign currency risk, the detail of the contribution to the main aggregates in the Abertis Group's consolidated statement of profit or loss by the companies that operate in a functional currency other than the euro is as follows:

(1) The contributions detailed do not include the contributions of their respective parents as the latter operate with the euro as their functional currency.
(2) Mainly the US dollar (USD) and the Indian rupee (INR).

The contribution to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2019 of the companies that operate in Brazilian reals, Chilean pesos, Argentine pesos and US dollars was adversely affected by the depreciation in the average value of the aforementioned currencies against the euro in 2019 (depreciation also in 2018).

62

The contribution to the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 of the companies that operate in Brazilian reais, Chilean pesos and Argentine pesos was affected by the depreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the aforementioned currencies in 2019 (depreciation also in 2018). The contribution to the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 of the companies that operate in US dollars was affected by the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the aforementioned currency in 2019 (appreciation also in 2018).

In this regard, the estimated sensitivity of the consolidated statements of profit or loss and consolidated equity to a change of 10% in the exchange rates against the euro of the main currencies in which the Abertis Group operates with respect to the exchange rate considered at year-end would be as follows:

(2) Impact on equity of translation differences arising on consolidation.

In this connection, the impacts with an effect on the Group's equity would be partially offset by the impact also on equity of the hedges of net investments made (see Notes 12 and 16.i).

ii) Interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk arises from current and non-current borrowings.
The borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk on its cash flows, whereas the borrowings arranged at a fixed rate expose the Group to interest rate risk in relation to fair value.

63

The purpose of interest risk management is to achieve a balance in the debt structure that makes it possible to minimise volatility in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over a multi-year time horizon. In this regard, at 31 December 2019 75% of borrowings were at fixed interest rates or fixed through hedging (31 December 2018: 82%), in line with Group policy, with the estimated net impact after taxes (and before minority interests) on profit or loss of a change of 50 basis points in the interest rate on floating rate debt of EUR 23.9 million in 2019 (2018: EUR 11.3 million) (see Note 16), after considering the effect of the hedging instruments arranged.
In this connection, and based on various estimates and objectives regarding the debt structure, in order to manage the interest rate risk on the cash flows, hedging transactions are carried out through the arrangement of derivative financial instruments consisting of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings bearing floating interest rates into borrowings bearing fixed rates, so the Group undertakes with other parties to exchange, at certain intervals, the difference between fixed interest and floating interest calculated on the basis of the main notional amounts arranged (see Note 12).
Also, in order to comply with the aforementioned objectives, the Group arranges fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to hedge fair value interest rate risk (see Note 12).
iii) Credit risk
Due to the nature of the Group's businesses, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk, since there are no significant accounts receivable except for those receivable from public authorities (which the Group monitors on a monthly basis) and balances with banks (mainly derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents).
Credit risk arises mainly from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits at banks and financial institutions, as well as other debts, including outstanding accounts receivable and committed transactions.
In this regard, the Group -in order to mitigate the aforementioned credit riskperforms derivative transactions and cash transactions only with banks of proven creditworthiness, recognised by international rating agencies. This creditworthiness, expressed by the rating of each entity, is reviewed periodically to ensure active management of counterparty risk.
64

The credit limits were not exceeded in the reporting periods and no losses are expected to arise from the default of any of the counterparties indicated.
iv) Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk prudently, which entails ensuring the availability of sufficient financing through committed credit facilities and the ability to liquidate market positions. Given the dynamic nature of the Group's businesses, management of the Financial Area aims to maintain flexible financing through the availability of committed credit facilities. The cash outflows projected in relation to the Group's borrowings and available credit facilities are detailed in Note 16.
v) Inflation risk The revenue of most of the toll road concessions arises from tolls tied directly to inflation. Consequently, a scenario of increased inflation would lead to an increase in the fair value of these projects. In this connection, in relation to Royal Decree 55/2017, of 3 February, implementing Law 2/2015, of 30 March, on de-indexing of the Spanish economy, it is estimated that the aforementioned Royal Decree should not have any impact on the tariffs applicable to the Spanish concessions operated by the Group (see Note 27-c), since the Royal Decree does not generally apply to concession arrangements already in force.
65

b) Fair value measurement
The measurement of the assets and liabilities at their fair value must be broken down by levels based on the hierarchy described in Note 3-e.v, the breakdown at 31 December of the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the aforementioned levels being as follows:

31 December 2019
Assets Financial assets at fair value through equity Derivative financial instruments:
Cash flow hedges Fair value hedges Hedges of a net investment in a foreign
operation Derivatives not designated as hedges

In 2019 and 2018 there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.
As indicated in Notes 3-d and 3-e, the fair value of the financial instruments traded in active markets is based on the market prices at the reporting date. The quoted price used for financial assets is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments not listed on an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The Group employs a variety of methods and uses assumptions based on the market conditions at each reporting date, including the concept of "transfer", as a result of which credit risk is taken into account.
For non-current borrowings observable market prices are used; the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows and the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using the forward exchange rates quoted in the market at the closing date. In this regard, the fair value based on the aforementioned hierarchies of the loans and bonds at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is detailed in Note 16.

67

c) Capital management

The Group's objective in relation to capital management is to safeguard its ability to continue operating as a going concern so that it can continue to generate returns for shareholders and profits for other holders of equity instruments, maintain an optimum capital structure and reduce the cost of capital.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of its leverage ratio, which is in line with the industry norm. This ratio is calculated by dividing net bond issues and bank borrowings by total capital. Net bond issues and bank borrowings are calculated as total borrowings from these banks (including current and non-current, as evidenced in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, plus net debt to these banks.
In 2019 the Group's strategy in this connection did not change significantly. In this regard, the increase in the leverage ratio at 31 December 2019 with respect to 2018 year-end was due mainly to the assumption of the acquisition debt (see Note 16), together with the net equity effect of the merger of the Parent with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (former shareholder of Abertis see Notes 6-a and 15-a).

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the leverage ratios were as follows:

5. MATTERS ARISING FROM THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW IFRSs ADOPTED
As indicated in Note 2-b.i, these consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 are the first in which IFRS 16, Leases has been applied.
IFRS 16, Leases
IFRS 16 modifies the accounting model for leases applicable to lessees. It became effective on 1 January 2019 and supersedes the following standards and interpretations previously in force: IAS 17, Leases and the associated IFRIC Interpretation 4, Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease; SIC-15, Operating Leases - Incentives; and SIC-27, Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The main new feature of IFRS 16 is that it introduces a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for almost all leases.
Under IFRS 16, unless the lease is a short-term lease (a term of one year or less) or a lease for which the underlying asset is of low value, a lessee must:
 At the commencement date, recognise a financial liability equal to the present value of the fixed payments to be made during the lease term (discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease) and a right-ofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset during the lease term, which shall be measured with reference to the amount of the associated financial liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease, any lease payments made before the commencement date and any future dismantling costs.
 Recognise in profit or loss the straight-line depreciation of the right-ofuse asset recognised and interest on the lease liability.
 Recognise in both equity and profit or loss the tax effect associated with the difference between IFRS 16 recognition criteria and tax recognition criteria.
The lease term is determined as, at most, the maximum length of time for which a lessee has the right to use an underlying asset under the lease.
69

Where a lease is acquired in a business combination, the lease liability shall be measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments as if the lease acquired were a new lease at the date of the business combination. The right-of-use asset shall be measured at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect the favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease with respect to market terms. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing, in the same way as all other assets with a finite useful life. In the statement of cash flows, a lessee shall classify cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability within operating activities. The Group applied IFRS 16 in accordance with Appendix C, C5 a) on effective date and transition, i.e., retrospectively and without restating comparative information. In this regard, Abertis applied the practical expedient provided for in IFRS 16 that states that it is not necessary to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, pursuant to IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, at the date of initial application, and decided to apply the requirements relating to the assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease to contracts entered into (or changed) on or after the date of initial application. The Group carried out an in-depth analysis of all its leases, excluding shortterm leases and leases of low-value assets, the main leases affected being those associated with the lease of offices and transport equipment. The variable lease payments and sublease income were not material at 31 December 2019.
70

Set forth below is a detail of the main impacts of the application of IFRS 16, consisting of the reconciliation of the aggregates in the consolidated balance sheet and of the Group's consolidated equity at 1 January 2019 in accordance with IFRSs without applying IFRSs 16 to those obtained by applying IFRSs 16:

In addition to the impacts shown above as a result of the first-time application of IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019, an additional depreciation charge of EUR 23 million and a finance cost of EUR 4 million arose for the Group, offset by an annual decrease of approximately EUR 28 million in operating expenses relating to the lease payments recognised in accordance with IAS 17.

6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
a) Acquisition of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by Atlantia S.p.A., Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft and subsequent merger with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
In 2018 Atlantia S.p.A. (Atlantia), Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) and Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) entered into an agreement in order to make a joint investment in Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.
As a result, Hochtief acquired an ownership interest of 98.7% in Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., resulting from a tender offer launched by it and an additional share purchase after the tender offer acceptance period had expired (8 May 2018).
Subsequently, pursuant to the aforementioned agreement, Abertis HoldCo, S.A. was incorporated, owned by Atlantia (50% plus one share), ACS (30%) and Hochtief (20% minus one share) and, in turn, Abertis HoldCo, S.A. incorporated the wholly-owned investee Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., which on 29 October 2018 acquired 98.7% of the share capital of Abertis from Hochtief for EUR 16,520 million.
Also, as described in Note 1, on 10 December 2018 the Boards of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. approved the draft terms of merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (the absorbing company) and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (the absorbed company). These draft terms of merger were approved by both the Extraordinary General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and the sole shareholder of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. on 8 February 2019, were executed in a public deed on 14 March 2019 and were registered at the Madrid Mercantile Registry on 15 March 2019, meaning that the merger was effective for accounting purposes from 1 January 2019.
As a result of the aforementioned transactions, these consolidated financial statements of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Subsidiaries reflect from 1 January 2019 the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group and, therefore, the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Abertis arising from the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed, as described below.
73

The detail of the net assets acquired and of the goodwill generated by the acquisition of Abertis at the acquisition date is as follows:

Thousands of euros - Purchase price Number of shares
Total purchase price (EUR 18.36/share) Fair value of the net assets acquired Resulting goodwill

100% 911,565,371
16,736,340 8,764,007 7,972,333

98.70% 899,757,113
16,519,541 8,650,848 7,868,693

The acquisition of Abertis by Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief reinforces its industrial project with the experience of new shareholders as infrastructure developers ("greenfield") and infrastructure managers ("brownfield") together with Abertis' own experience in the management and operation of infrastructure. The new shareholders perceive their investment in Abertis as a stable and long-term investment, with reciprocal cooperation for the development of a global project through an international company. In this regard, the investment agreement signed by the shareholders establishes a framework of cooperation for the performance of their respective commercial activities in the toll road area in which Abertis will participate. Combining the greenfield and brownfield activities, the capabilities of Abertis and its shareholders constitute an integrated range of services that differentiate them from potential competitors, an aspect that could result in greater bidding success and higher rates of return on future investments.
Additionally, Abertis has a clear growth strategy and a historically successful track record in managing operations with the concession grantors (government), something which is key in the concession management activity and in the creation of value based on the Group's current concession portfolio.
In this regard, the foregoing, together with the development of the current infrastructure concession portfolio of Abertis, will strengthen the Group's businesses and, consequently, justify the financial goodwill resulting from the PPA performed, amounting to EUR 7,869 million; which is endorsed on the existence of a single cash generating unit that is the Abertis Group as a whole.
The acquisition-date fair value of the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired was determined basically using valuation techniques.

74

The measurement of the aforementioned fair value and the corresponding purchase price allocation (PPA) process was conducted internally, without the involvement of an independent third-party valuer (as was the case with other business combinations carried out by Abertis in previous years), considering that, on the one hand, IFRS 3 (Revised) does not require PPA processes to be carried out with an independent valuer; and on the other hand, the Group has an internal team with sufficient knowledge and experience in the industry in which the acquired business operates and in PPA processes.
In this regard, set forth below is a detail of the assets and liabilities whose fair values estimated in the PPA differ from their previous carrying amount and of the valuation methods used in each case:

a) Intangible assets
Administrative concessions
The valuation method used was based on the discounted cash flow method, using the methodology described in Note 9. The cash flow projections obtained were prepared on the basis of the projected income and expenses (the main assumptions of which relate mainly to the evolution of the volume of traffic, tariffs and inflation) and of the projected investments, which were discounted to present value using a market discount rate (WACC) ranging from 5.0% to 11.4%. The detail of the main assumptions made is as follows:

Spain France Italy Brazil Chile Puerto Rico India

Activity (ADT) 1.2% to 1.7% 1.4% 1.0% 3.5% 3.2% to 4.5% 0.0% to 1.1% 6.9% to 7.5%

Average tariff 1.7% to 2.2% 1.2% to 1.3% 0.0% 3.9% 1.0% to 6.5% 1.0% to 3.5% 3.9% to 4.0%

WACCs () 6.8% 5.0% 6.4%
10.0% 7.1%
11.4% 10.0%

75

The most significant components of the discount rate applied (WACC) are summarised as follows:
i) Risk Free Rate: the interest rate offered by long-term sovereign bonds. It is determined using current market data and estimates of equilibrium levels (using standard econometric models) in which the interest rates should be located, thus adjusting the returns that are at low rates due to the significant influence of public debt purchases carried out by central banks;
ii) Market Risk Premium (ERP): measures the additional risk that is demanded of equity assets above the return on risk-free assets. It is determined using a combination of historical approaches (ex post), backed by external publications and time series studies of past yields, and prospective approaches (ex ante), based on market publications, taking into account medium and long-term profit expectations depending on the degree of maturity and development of each country; and
iii) Beta coefficient: the multiplier of the market risk premium, considered as a systemic risk. It is estimated using series of historical prices of shares of comparable companies that are publicly traded, determining the correlation between the yield of the shares of the companies and the yield of the general index of the stock exchange of the country where there shares are listed. The main underlying data used in these calculations are obtained from external public sources of independent information of acknowledged prestige.
Relationships with customers
The relationships with customers identified are associated with electronic toll payment subscriptions: the valuation method is as described in Note 3-b).iv.
76

b) Financial assets: Receivables from public authorities The valuation method used was based on the discounted cash flow method. The cash flow projections obtained were prepared on the basis of the estimated net collections made by the related public authorities, discounted at a market discount rate (WACC) in the affected countries, ranging from 6.8% to 7.1%, coinciding with the rates used in the case of section a) above.
Investments in associates The valuation method used was based on discounting the dividends received from investees at a market discount rate (cost of equity or "Ke") in the affected countries, ranging from 6.6% to 8.6%, calculated using the methodology described in section a) above.
c) Non-current assets classified as held for sale The valuation method was based on the sale agreement entered into (Note 7).
d) Borrowings The valuation method used was based on the market value of the quoted liabilities (Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, see Notes 3-e).v, 4-b) and 16), and the fair value of unquoted liabilities was determined on the basis of the methodology described in Notes 3-e).v, 4-b) and 16 (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). Also, where appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognised to reflect the tax effect of the remeasurement of the fair value of the aforementioned assets and liabilities with respect to their tax base.

Because of the date on which the acquisition of Abertis by Atlantia, ACS and Hochthief was completed, at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the allocation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is considered as definitive.

Lastly, as a result of the merger in 2019 between Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., effective for accounting purposes from 1 January 2019, these consolidated financial statements include the effect of the aforementioned PPA to the assets and liabilities of Abertis. In this regard, on 1 January 2019 the Group recognised the impact on these consolidated financial statements of the aforementioned revaluation as a result of the acquisition on 29 October 2018, together with the impacts associated therewith from that date until 31 December 2018, relating mainly to the amortisation of the concession infrastructure amounting to EUR 257 million, before considering the related tax effect, and to the measurement of borrowings at amortised cost, which led to a reduction, before considering the related tax effect, of EUR 119 million in the borrowing costs for that period.

Also, in 2018 no business combinations took place that might be material with respect to these consolidated financial statements.

i) Hispasat (satellite telecommunications)
As indicated in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for 2017, at the end of 2017 Abertis decided to discontinue the satellite telecommunications business (Hispasat subgroup) effective in November 2017, since it had at that time initiated an orderly divestment process for the satellite telecommunications business in order to focus the growth of Abertis only on the toll roads operating segment.
Consequently, based on IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, from 30 November 2017 to the date of its sale on 3 October 2019, the assets and liabilities relating to the satellite telecommunications business were presented as assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups held for sale. Also, since the divestment involves a significant and separate line of business, all the income and expenses for the year were presented as "Loss from Discontinued Operations".
On 12 February 2019, Abertis reached an agreement with Red Eléctrica Corporación for the sale of the Group's 89.68% holding in Hispasat. Once all the requisite administrative authorisations had been obtained, the sale was completed on 3 October 2019 for EUR 933 million, with no gain or loss arising on the transaction.

80

As a result of this transaction, and in accordance with its strategy to focus on the toll road industry, Abertis no longer holds any ownership interest in Hispasat.
The main financial aggregates relating to the discontinued operations arising from the discontinuation of the satellite telecommunications business until its disposal and the corresponding figures for the year 2018 are as follows:

At 31 December 2018, Abertis Telecom Satélites, S.A. (a wholly-owned investee of Abertis which until 3 October 2019 directly held 89.68% of the shares of Hispasat owed Abertis a total of EUR 243,493 thousand (31 December 2018: EUR 489,508 thousand), which were duly eliminated on consolidation. This amount was therefore excluded from the balance of "Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet shown above. As a balancing entry for the aforementioned account payable to the Group, Abertis recognised borrowings from third parties under "NonCurrent Liabilities - Bond Issues and Bank Borrowings" in the consolidated balance sheet which, consequently, were not included under "Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations".
The income and expense recognised directly in equity relate mainly to translation differences and valuation adjustments relating to hedges, which at the date of sale amounted to EUR 2,640 thousand and EUR 2,080 thousand, respectively (2018: EUR -5,281 thousand and EUR -2,808 thousand, respectively).

ii) Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex)
Also, in 2018, in the framework of the tender offer for shares of Abertis described in Note 15-a.i to the consolidated financial statements for 2018, the divestment of the entire ownership interest in the investee Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (Cellnex), in which an ownership interest of 34% had been held at 31 December 2017, was completed. In this connection, the main milestones of the aforementioned process that took place in 2018 were as follows:

83

i. On 14 March 2018, Atlantia, S.p.A. (Atlantia) published a relevant event communication announcing the agreement reached with Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) and ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) whereby, if the tender offer for shares of Abertis launched by Hochtief were completed successfully, Atlantia would be entitled to demand that Hochtief take the measures required for Abertis to sell all or a portion of its ownership interest in Cellnex to Atlantia or to such company as Atlantia might designate. This possible sale would be effected in the following terms:
a) The selling price for the shares of Cellnex would be their average market price in the six months prior to the settlement of the Hochtief tender offer, with a floor of EUR 21.20 per Cellnex share and a cap of EUR 21.50 per Cellnex share (adjusted by such gross dividends as might be paid after the date of the agreement).
b) 29.9% or 34% of the share capital of Cellnex would be transferred, as decided by Atlantia.
c) This sale would have to be settled in the two months following the settlement of the Hochtief tender offer, which took place on 18 May 2018.
ii. On 23 March 2018, Atlantia published a new relevant event communication announcing its decision to exercise the aforementioned call option and, in addition, to enter into a put option agreement with Edizione S.r.L. (Edizione) whereby Atlantia acquired the option to sell to Edizione shares representing the 29.9% stake in Cellnex that Atlantia would obtain prior to the execution of the aforementioned call option agreement. This sale would be effected for a price of EUR 21.50 gross per share. This put option did not place any restriction on Atlantia's right to receive and accept, as the case may be, other offers for, or expressions of interest in, Cellnex shares.
iii. On 16 April 2018, Atlantia published a new relevant event communication announcing that it had not received any offers for the shares of Cellnex on which it held a call option that bettered that made by Edizione and, therefore, that it had decided to exercise its put option vis-à-vis Edizione in relation to shares representing 29.9% of the share capital of Cellnex.
iv. On 5 June 2018, Abertis sold shares representing 4.1% of the share capital of Cellnex to qualified investors through an accelerated bookbuilt offering. Through this offering, Abertis sold 9,499,013 Cellnex shares for a price, net of fees and commissions, of EUR 22.45 per share (EUR 213,253 thousand), giving rise to a non-taxable gain of EUR 79,726 thousand.
84

v. Lastly, on 12 July 2018 Abertis completed the sale of shares representing 29.9% of the share capital of Cellnex to the Italian company ConnecT S.p.A. (Connect, a subsidiary of Edizione S.r.l.). Specifically, Abertis sold 69,273,289 Cellnex shares for a price of EUR 21.50 per share (EUR 1,489,376 thousand), giving rise to a non-taxable gain of EUR 525,698 thousand.
In connection with all the foregoing, it should be noted that following the completion in May 2018 of the tender offer for all the shares of Abertis, the Group considered that the requirements provided for in IFRS 5 for classifying the ownership interest that it held in the share capital of Cellnex as a noncurrent asset held for sale had been met. Consequently, based on "IFRS 5Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", since 31 May 2018 the asset relating to the ownership interest in Cellnex, until then recognised under "Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures", has been recognised as assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale, although, as mentioned above, at 31 December 2018 Abertis had completed the divestment of its entire ownership interest in Cellnex. Also, since this asset was not a separate major line of business, the profit or loss contributed by Cellnex in the period up to its sale continued to be presented under "Result of Companies Accounted for Using the Equity Method" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year, and the gain obtained on the sale of the ownership interest as a whole (34.0%) is presented under "Gains or Losses on Disposals of Financial Instruments" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The exchange differences that arose in the year relate primarily to assets in Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico and were a result of the depreciation in the year-end exchange rates of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso, and the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar in the case of Puerto Rico. In 2018 they related primarily to assets in Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico and were a result of the depreciation in the year-end exchange rates of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso and the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar in the case of Puerto Rico.
The additions in 2019 relate mainly to certain upgrades to assets of the Hit subgroup amounting to EUR 36 million (2018: 51 million).
It should be noted that no interest was capitalised in either 2019 or 2018.
The detail of the grants related to assets -which are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset financed with a reduction in the depreciation charge for the year and are recognised as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and returnable assets, is as follows:

At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of impairment exists, it estimates the asset's recoverable amount applying the general policies described in Note 3-c. The assessment carried out at 31 December 2019 did not reveal any indications of impairment or, therefore, the need to recognise significant impairment losses (as was also the case at 2018 year-end).

Also, at 31 December 2019 the Group mantains firm property, plant and equipment purchase commitments of EUR 3,399 thousand corresponding mainly to assets of Túnels (2018 year-end: EUR 3,848 thousand corresponding mainly to assets of Metropistas).

Also, at 31 December 2019 the following items of property, plant and equipment were subject to restrictions and/or had been pledged as security for liabilities:

The exchange differences that arose in 2019 relate primarily to assets in Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico and were a result of the depreciation in the yearend exchange rates of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, and the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar, as was the case in 2018.

91

As indicated in Note 6, as a result of the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. and the corresponding inclusion in the consolidated balance sheet since 1 January 2019 of the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group detailed in the aforementioned Note, an increase of EUR 13,638,288 thousand was recognised in the Group's intangible assets (EUR 13,540,502 thousand under "Administrative Concessions" and EUR 97,786 thousand under "Other Intangible Assets") arising from the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed, as described in Note 6 (at 29 October 2018, the date of gain of control by Atlantia, a total of EUR 13,922,999 thousand was recognised, of which EUR 13,824,392 corresponded to administrative concessions and EUR 98,607 thousand to other intangible assets).
The additions in 2019 (as in 2018) to "Administrative Concessions" relate mainly to the following subgroups and/or concession operators.

As in 2018, the additions shown are a result of investments made in the year primarily to expand the capacity of the toll road networks owned by these subgroups and/or concession operators.

It should be noted that in 2018 in the case of the Chilean concession operators, this included CLP 119,284 million (EUR 150 million) corresponding to the investment obligation of Sol, recognised at the present value thereof with a balancing entry under the corresponding other liabilities account, in relation to the agreement executed in the year for the performance of construction work associated mainly with the construction of third lanes leading to Talagante.

The transfers in 2018 included, by virtue of the agreements entered into by the Argentine consolidated companies Ausol and Gco to amend the concession arrangements operated by them, a transfer on 24 July 2018 to "Concession Arrangements - Financial Asset Model", for an amount of EUR 101,167 thousand (at the exchange rate then prevailing) relating to the value of the unamortised intangible asset associated therewith (previously restated for the effects of hyperinflation in accordance with IAS 29 as indicated below).

92

Also, "Other" includes mainly the impact associated with the revision of the discount rate in relation to the recognition of the Exceptional Voluntary Contribution (EVC) by the French concession operators. Under the agreement reached with the French Government for "Plan Relance" for French toll roads, consideration was given, inter alia, to the annual payment to the French Government (until the end of the concession) of EUR 10 million for the Exceptional Voluntary Contribution, an obligation recognised at its present value under "Administrative Concessions", with a balancing entry under "Other Liabilities" (see Note 21).
Also, in 2018 "Other" included mainly:
 On the one hand, the recognition by the Chilean company Andes of a grant from the Chilean Ministry of Public Works (CLP 22,758,749 thousand, EUR 29,844 thousand, at 31 December 2018) in connection with the new stretch of toll road brought into service in February 2018. As indicated in Note 3-a, grants related to assets received are recognised as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and returnable asset balances and are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the years of useful life of the asset being financed, reducing the related period depreciation charge.
 On the other, in relation to the consolidated companies GCO and Ausol, as described in Note 2-g.vi to the consolidated financial statements for 2018, as the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary, it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of these Group companies located in Argentina in order to express them in terms of the current measuring unit at the end of the reporting period. In this connection, the cumulative historical differences between the restated costs and the previous costs of intangible asset items at 31 December 2017, amounting to EUR 167,901 thousand, were recognised with a credit to "Translation Differences" and "NonControlling Interests" in consolidated equity with effect for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018.
In 2019 the capitalised borrowing costs amounted to EUR 20,336 thousand (2018: EUR 21,013 thousand) and related mainly to the extension and upgrade works carried out by the Arteris subgroup (EUR 19,889 thousand in 2019 and EUR 20,303 thousand in 2018).
Lastly, it should also be noted that the changes in 2019 arising from changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations related to the impact associated with the gain of control of Trados (Note 2.h).

25,401,490

14,092,052

(1) Administrative concessions associated with assets that operate in a currency other than the euro (mainly the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the US dollar) and whose value in euros was therefore affected by the change in the year-end exchange rate.
(2) Concession whose contract had expired at 31 December 2019.

The change in the year is due primarily to the impact of the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed arising from the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group detailed in Note 6 after the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. effective as of 1 January 2019.

95

iii) Impairment losses
As detailed in Notes 3-b and 3-c, at each balance sheet date (and at least at each year-end) the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of the assets may have become impaired, such as a very significant drop in traffic and/or highly adverse changes in the main macroeconomic aggregates of the countries in which the assets are located (GDP, inflation, interest rates, etc.), taking into account the potential impact on the aggregates of the concession asset. If any such indication exists, or when an annual impairment test has to be performed (in the case of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset, for which purpose, as stated in the aforementioned Notes, the following steps were taken:
a) Administrative concessions
To determine the fair value of the "Administrative Concessions" the following steps were taken:
 The time in which it is estimated that the investment will generate cash flows (the concession term of the toll road concession operators, of between 1 and 42 years) was determined. Projections for periods longer than five years are used, since concession infrastructure has a finite life and, therefore, the period over which cash flows are projected has been clearly restricted and defined (as indicated above, the remaining concession term is used).
 Before preparing the revenue and expense projections, the Group checked, inter alia, the changes in the most significant variables included in the impairment test for 2018, and the achievement of the key assumptions used in that test, against the results obtained in 2019, in order to assess any possible variances. The comparison of the projections for 2019 included in the impairment tests of 2018 and the actual results for 2019 did not disclose any significant variances.
96

 Revenue and expense projections were prepared using the following general criteria: o In the case of revenue, in order to estimate changes in tariffs, the Group took into consideration the official CPI forecast of each country in which the concession assets are located (considering the corresponding tariff revision formulas established in the concession arrangements of the various toll roads, based on changes in the local CPI and/or any specific adjustments). To estimate the activity of the toll road business (average daily traffic, or ADT), the reference used was the GDP growth forecasts made by the official agencies in each country (including any applicable corrections). The past performance of each investment with respect to GDP, the maturity of each infrastructure and other specific aspects that might affect the activity in the future are also taken into account. o Expenses were estimated on the basis of the foreseeable changes in the CPI, the projected activity and the operating efficiency plans implemented by the Group. o Also, the impact of future infrastructure maintenance and upgrade work was considered on the basis of the best estimates available and the Group's experience, taking into account projected activity.
 The cash projections obtained from the revenue and expense projection described above were discounted at a discount rate in local currency resulting from adding to the long-term cost of risk-free money, the risk premium assigned by the market to each country where the activity takes place, the risk premium assigned by the market to each business (at long term, in both cases) and the target market financial structure of the related cash-generating unit according to the methodology described in Note 6.
The projections are generally based on the budgets and on the most recent long-term projections available prepared by the Management and taken into consideration by the Board of Directors, which take into account recent historical developments.

(*) In 2018 applicable for the most significant items of goodwill allocated and intangible assets (mainly administrative concessi ons).

Therefore, according to the estimates and projections available to the directors of the Group and of each of the companies concerned, the projected cash flows attributable to these cash-generating units (or groups of units) to which the concession assets (mainly concession arrangements revalued in 2019 as detailed in Note 6) are allocated will make it possible to recover the carrying amount of the intangible assets recognised at 31 December 2019 and, therefore, no impairment losses were recognised at 2019 year-end (as at 2018 year-end).

Finally, when analyzing the sensitivity of the impairment tests, the most relevant aspects are that they support a minimum increase in the discount rate of about 100 basis points and, on the other hand, would withstand an annual drop in cash flows projected of up to 100 basis points.

b) Goodwill
"Goodwill" at December 31, 2019 mainly corresponds to the process arising from the allocation of the purchase price derived from the effects of the takeover of the Abertis Group by Atlantia after the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (Note 6).
Also, as indicated in Note 6, the goodwill described above is based, among other aspects, on the capacity and growth strategy of the Group together with the development of the current portfolio of Abertis infrastructure concessions, which is considered as a single cash generating unit as a whole.

99

In this context, the Group annually compares the book value of the cash generating unit (CGU), which includes the aforementioned goodwill itself, with the fair value obtained through the valuation method of discounted cash flow agreements according to the methodology described in Note 6. In this regard, the Group, in accordance with that described in IAS 36, has considered that the most appropriate method has been deemed to be the valuation of a projected finite 5-year period (2020-2024) along with the estimation of the residual value.
On the basis of the budgets and latest long-term projections described in section a) above, the performance of the impairment test on goodwill of Abertis Group at 31 December 2019 was based on:
 The cash projections obtained from the income and expense projections for the whole Abertis Group for the period 2020-2024, according to the criteria described in section a) above.
 In order to calculate the residual value, the increase of 2% on the operating free cash flow after tax of the last projected year (i.e. 2024) was applied on the one hand and, in addition, a cash outflow for investments in perpetuity equal to the amortisation for this period has been considered.
The discount rate (WACC in euros) applied to cash flow projections was 5.78% and was calculated in accordance with the methodology described in Note 6. In the case of residual value, the WACC applied was increased by 2%.
With regard to the goodwill impairment test, the recoverable amount obtained (calculated on the basis of the fair value as mentioned earlier) exceeds the goodwill carrying amount, allowing for the recovery of the carrying amount recognised on 31 December 2019. Therefore, no impairment provision whatsoever needs to be made.
According to the sensitivity analysis carried out, given variations in the discount rates of +100 basis points, in the annual growth rates "g" of the terminal value of -100 basis points and in activity growth rates of -100 basis points, it would remain without recording impairment in the goodwill registered by the Company as of December 31, 2019.

101

The following investment obligations of the Group are also worthy of mention:
 In January 2017 Sanef entered into a memorandum of understanding with the French Government to launch a new investment plan to modernise its network, which was ultimately completed on 24 July 2018. Under the agreement, Sanef will invest EUR 122 million in various projects in exchange for an additional annual increase in tolls for 2019-2021 (0.225% for Sanef and 0.218% for Sapn). At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 1.7 million had been made (2018 year-end: EUR 0 million).
 The Hit/Sanef subgroup, within the framework of "Plan Relance" for French toll roads formalised in 2015, reached an agreement with the French Government to make investments of approximately EUR 600 million to upgrade the toll road network in exchange for the extension of the term of the concessions (two years for Sanef and three years and eight months for Sapn). At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 417 million had been made (2018 year-end: EUR 274 million).
 In August 2016 the A4 subgroup received approval from the Comitato Interministeriale per la Programazione Economica (CIPE) to upgrade the A31 toll road by carrying out the "Valdastico Norte" project, which led to the confirmation of the term of the concession arrangements for the A4 and A31 toll roads until 31 December 2026 (see Note 27-c). The purpose of this project, which is currently being designed, is to build a road interconnection corridor between the d'Astico Valley, the La Valsugana Valley and the Adige Valley and will entail for the A4 subgroup, by the time the project has been completed, estimated total investments of around EUR 2,200 million pursuant to the current economic and financial plan. The investments will be recovered, as described in Note 3-b.ii, partly during the remaining concession term (up to December 2026) and partly through an unconditional right to receive an amount from the grantor that will be exercised at the end of the concession term. At the reporting date, investments amounting to EUR 27 million had been made (EUR 24 million at 31 December 2018).
 Also in 2016 Autopista Central entered into a non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work in connection with the Nudo de Quilicura junction (the estimated investment in building works amounts to close to UF 14.1 million, approximately EUR 470 million at 31 December 2019), which in return would lead to the extension of the concession arrangement by around 32 months.
102

In March 2018, DGOP Exempt Resolution No. 840 was formalized, modifying, for reasons of public interest, the characteristics of the works and services of the Concession Contract, having to develop Autopista Central the definitive engineering study called "PID Readecuación Nudo Quilicura "; likewise, the works called "Obras Complementarias del Nudo Quilicura" (Túnel lo Ruiz) and the Technological Systems and Equipment, corresponding to Phase 1 of the "Nudo Quilicura" project, must be executed, conserved, maintained and operated. However, as of the date of preparation of these consolidated annual accounts, the Complementary Agreement and Supreme Decree for both Phases of the project have not yet been perfected.
 In the case of Sol, in March 2018 a Supreme Decree was published formalising the framework memorandum of understanding and the resolution ordering the performance of the engineering work (both documents signed in 2016 with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works) relating to the project for construction work associated mainly with the construction of third lanes leading to Talagante (the estimated maximum investment is around UF 4.6 million, approximately EUR 150 million at 31 December 2019 including VAT and project administration expenses), which in return has led to the extension of the concession arrangement in 22 months, from May 2019 to March 2021 (see Note 27-c). At the reporting date, investments amounting to CLP 23 billion had been made (CLP 1.4 billion at 31 December 2018, approximately 27 million euros and 1.8 million euros in the respective periods).
 Also, on 25 January 2018 Sol entered into a new non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work in connection with the new access to San Antonio Port ("NAPSA") the estimated maximum investment being around UF 406 thousand (approximately EUR 14 million at 31 December 2019). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by an eight-month extension to the concession arrangement, and the Ministry of Public Works may choose to replace this extension with a direct payment of the balance not yet settled in this connection. On August 31, 2019, the Supreme Decree that formalized the framework agreement protocol and the resolution that instructed the completion of the engineering detailed above was published, while the Ministry of Public Works has not communicated its decision to exercise the option of payment, so that the concession term has been extended in 8 months until November 2021. At present, investments have been made for an accumulated amount of CLP 15 billion (approximately 18 million euros at 31 December 2019).
103

 On 31 May 2018 Rutas del Pacífico entered into a non-binding framework memorandum of understanding with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works relating to the possible performance of construction work associated with the implementation of a free-flow electronic tolling system, with an estimated maximum investment of close to UF 473 thousand (around EUR 16 million at 31 December 2019). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by a ten-month extension to the concession arrangement. This memorandum of understanding was executed in November 2018 by means of an ad referendum agreement, and was published in the Chilean Official Gazette on 15 December 2018, at which time it became fully effective. At present, investments have been made for an accumulated amount of CLP 20 million (approximately 23 million euros at 31 December 2019).
 On 31 May 2018, Libertadores agreed with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works the bases for a future non-binding framework memorandum of understanding relating to the possible performance of construction work associated with the implementation of a free-flow and stop & go electronic tolling system, with an estimated maximum investment of close to UF 100 thousand (around EUR 3 million at 31 December 2019). The investments, loss of revenue and increased costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system will be offset by a eleven-month extension to the concession arrangement, and the Ministry of Public Works may choose to replace this extension with a direct payment of the balance not yet settled in this connection. The corresponding resolution ordering the performance of the engineering and construction work associated with the aforementioned project was handed down on 23 November 2018 and processed on 17 December 2018. The corresponding Complementary Agreement was signed in November 2019, but on the date of formulation of these consolidated annual accounts, the corresponding Supreme Decree has not yet been published.
 The Group also has various investment obligations under agreements entered into with the grantors (see Note 13.i).

The exchange differences that arose in the year relate primarily to assets in the UK and were a result of the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling (also an appreciation in the exchange rate at 2018 yearend).

106

The most notable changes in 2019, in addition to the Group's share of profit or loss and the accrued dividends, are as follows:
 The impact of the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. and the corresponding inclusion in the consolidated balance sheet since 1 January 2019 of the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group detailed in Note 6, amounting to EUR 291,169 thousand arising from the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed, as described in the aforementioned Note (primarily revaluing its ownership interests in Alis and A'lienor), the impact at 29 October 2018 (the date of the gain of control) being EUR 292,213 thousand.
 The changes in the scope of consolidation and business combinations correspond to the impact associated with the gain of control of the associate Trados (including the associate M-45 Conservación in which it holds an ownership interest), which started to be fully consolidated (see Note 2-h).
 The translation differences relate mainly to RMG (due to the appreciation in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling).
 Also, the ownership interest in Rio de Vetrai was derecognised after its sale, with no no impact since it had been written down in full.
Also, the most noteworthy changes in 2018 were as follows:
 The increases in the year related to the subscription of the capital increases carried out at Bip&Drive, S.A. and Leonord, S.A.S. (in both of which Abertis continues to hold an ownership interest of 35%).
 As detailed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018, the transfer to "Assets Classified as Held for Sale" corresponds to 34% of the capital held in Cellnex at the time of the transfer, which had been disposed of in full at 2018 year-end.
 Derecognition of the investments in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa (which had been written down in full) as associates after the order for the commencement of the liquidation phase had become final, which is the cause for the automatic dissolution of a company and its irrevocable liquidation, and the transfer of the management of its assets to Seittsa.
 The translation differences related mainly to Coviandes and Coninvial (as a result of the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Colombian peso) and RMG (due to the drop in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling).

(1) The goodwill detailed in the foregoing table is included in the value of the investments in associates and interests in jointly controlled entities accounted for using the equity method. In the case of RMG the change is affected by the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the pound sterling. In the case of Alis the change is affected by the purchase price allocation associated with the gain of control of Abertis and its subsequent merger with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (Nota 6)
(2) The entire revaluation resulting from the purchase price allocation process detailed in Note 6, has been assigned as the highest value of the concession contract
(3) Also included are the Italian companies Rio de Vetrai, CIS and G.R.A di Padova the carrying amounts of which at 2019 and 2018 year-end (except in the case of Rio de Vetrai in 2018) were EUR 0 thousand.

As indicated in Note 2-g.i, if the Group's share of the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or has payment commitments on behalf of the associate.

In this context, and as in prior years, no additional losses were recognised in the case of the associates Rio de Vetrai, C.I.S and G.R.A di Padova (in 2018 in addition to the foregoing companies Alis, Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa), the carrying amount of all of which has been reduced to zero (and in the case of Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa the carrying amount of the loans to them have also been reduced to zero).

i) Investments in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa
In relation to the ownership interests held by the Group in Irasa, Alazor and Ciralsa, since the companies had not passed the common phase of the insolvency proceedings as the various arrangement proposals submitted had not been approved, in 2017 the respective courts issued orders agreeing to the commencement of the liquidation phase and, consequently, the termination of the respective concession contracts was requested (in the case of Alazor and Irasa, the concession arrangements were operated by the investees Accesos and Henarsa, respectively). Subsequently, in March, April and May 2018, the concession infrastructure of these operators, R2 (Irasa), Circunvalación de Alicante (Ciralsa) and R3-R5 (Alazor), began to be managed by Sociedad Estatal de Infraestructuras del Transporte Terrestre, S.A. (Seittsa), which was subrogated to the activity and the personnel of the original operators. In this context and within the framework of the irrevocable liquidation processes indicated above, the aforementioned concession infrastructure was replaced by the amount resulting from Governmental Liability (Responsabilidad Patrimonial de la Administración (RPA)).

109

It should be noted in relation to the investment held in Alazor that its shareholders and the guarantors of the latter, including Iberpistas and Acesa, entered into an agreement with its creditor banks to provide financial support. Pursuant to this support agreement, certain of the creditor banks filed a claim against the shareholders and their guarantors in 2014 for the enforcement of possible obligations with regard to a portion of the borrowings. In this regard, at the end of February 2014 the Group arranged the payment into court of the deposit for the amount claimed, totalling EUR 131 million.
In relation to the aforementioned claims, on 27 March 2015 an order enforcing the aforementioned judgment was received upholding the enforcement claim submitted by Alazor's creditor banks and obliging Alazor's shareholders to pay the amounts claimed. By virtue of this order, on 28 April 2015 the claimant creditor banks requested the payment of the amounts claimed which Iberpistas and Acesa had already deposited into the court in 2014 in accordance with the foregoing.
In view of these circumstances, on 5 May 2015 the Group requested the court to suspend the payment request and on 11 May 2015 it filed an appeal against the enforcement order, reiterating the request to suspend the obligation to hand over any amounts to the claimants. In this regard, in May 2016 the court granted leave to proceed with the request of the enforcing banks and, therefore, EUR 89 million of the total EUR 131 million deposited into court by Iberpistas and Acesa were handed over to the banks, following which a portion of the provision recognised in relation to the existing deposit was recognised in profit or loss. In relation to the aforementioned enforcement proceeding, on 19 September 2017 the Madrid Provincial Appellate Court handed down a decision on the appeal against the court judgment obliging payment to be made to the creditor banks, finding for the shareholders of Alazor and thereby setting aside the enforcement proceeding and ordering the creditor banks to refund the amounts they had received provisionally. Accordingly, at the end of December 2017 Iberpistas and Acesa were refunded most of the amounts paid into the court previously (the entire amount at 31 December 2018), which was recognised with a credit to the aforementioned provisions.
110

On 4 and 11 December 2018, the new agent bank of the syndicate of current creditor banks of Alazor and Accesos required -out of court- the shareholders of Alazor and its guarantors, by virtue of the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support, to pay the amounts they consider outstanding of the subordinated loan arranged by Alazor with Accesos (EUR 176 million corresponding to the guarantee they attribute to the Group companies). In this regard, on 22 January 2019 an action in ordinary declaratory proceedings was lodged by five funds that claim to be current creditors of a portion of the bank debt of Alazor and Accesos, claiming from Alazor's shareholders and its guarantors certain financial contribution obligations arising from the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support (EUR 223.5 million relating to the guarantee they attribute to the Group companies). Also, on 3 June 2019 an action in ordinary declaratory proceedings was lodged by the same agent bank of the syndicate of the current creditor banks of Alazor and Accesos, claiming from Alazor's shareholders and its guarantors certain financial contribution obligations arising from the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support (EUR 175.6 million relating to the guarantee they attribute to the Abertis Group companies). Both processes remained unresolved at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
In this context, as the risks giving rise to the initial recognition of the provisions by the Group in prior years, it was considered reasonable to maintain them to cater for probable future payments as a result of the guarantees given to Alazor's creditor banks (Note 20.ii).
Also, in relation to the ownership interest held in Irasa, of which Iberpistas and Avasa are shareholders, on 2 October 2019 an action in ordinary declaratory proceedings was lodged by five funds that claim to be current creditors of a portion of the bank debt of Irasa, claiming from Irasa's shareholders and its guarantors certain financial contribution obligations arising from the aforementioned agreement to provide financial support (specifically, EUR 141.4 million relating to the guarantee they attribute to the Abertis Group companies), being the process pending resolution at the date of authorization for issue of these consolidated financial statements. In this context, the Group and its advisors do not consider probable the existence of future disbursements as a result of the guarantees granted to the financial institutions that credit Irasa, and therefore no provision has been recorded in this regard."
Lastly, as regards these investments, it is considered that with the provisions recognised in prior years the resolution of the aforementioned insolvency proceedings and lawsuits will not have a significant impact on these consolidated financial statements.
111

In any event, Abertis will respond with as many legal actions as may be necessary to protect its interests and those of its shareholders.

(2) A company derecognised at 2019 year-end after its sale on 5 December 2019 for the amount of the account receivable from this company because the ownership interest therein had been written down in full.

Until 31 December 2018, the toll road concession arrangements of the joint ventures of the Abertis Group, accounted for using the intangible asset model under IFRIC 12, related to the concession arrangement for the construction, maintenance and operation of the O'Donnell - N-IV stretch of the M-45 road in Madrid entered into by the Madrid Autonomous Community Government and Trados 45, ending in August 2029, a company over which the Group obtained control in 2019 (see Notes 2-h and 27-c).

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the joint ventures did not have any contingent liabilities or commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment or intangible assets of a significant value.

The financial information on the assets and liabilities and profit or loss for the year of the joint ventures detailed above (all of which are included in the toll roads operating segment), which are accounted for using the equity method, broken down by business segment, is summarised as follows:

Note: These amounts are accounted for in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of profit or loss using the equity method and do not include consolidation adjustments.

iii) Impairment losses
In addition to the impairment tests referred to above, the Group performed impairment tests to determine the recoverability of the investments in associates as well as in companies under joint control (joint ventures). To perform these tests, the Group considered future cash flow projections in a manner similar to that indicated in Note 2-g.i.
A summary of all of these matters for the most significant assets is as follows:

2019

Cash-generating unit
Autema Alis A'lienor

CPI 1.96%

Tariffs 1.87%

Activity (ADT)
1.03%

Expenses 2.24%

Discount rate
6.83%

As a result of the impairment tests performed to verify the recoverability of the investments in associates and in companies under joint control (joint ventures), it became apparent that the cash flow projections attributable to these cash-generating units made it possible to recover the carrying amount thereof at 31 December 2019 and, therefore, no impairment losses were recognised at that date (as was the case at the end of 2018). With regard to impairment, the following should be noted:

Autema
In relation to the recoverability of the ownership interest in Autema, the projections considered in the impairment test for 2019 (as in 2018) already included the new conditions established unilaterally by the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government in the concession arrangement.
In this regard, as a result of the amendment of the terms and conditions of the concession arrangement, Autema filed pleadings with the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government expressly opposing the projected amendment of the terms and conditions of the concession arrangement. The pleadings were not addressed by the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government, which passed a Decree unilaterally amending the concession arrangement. Autema filed an appeal against this Decree at the Catalonia High Court, on which a decision had not been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.

iv) Other disclosures
Also, as at 2018 year-end, at the end of 2019 there were no significant restrictions on the capacity of associates or joint ventures (companies under joint control) to transfer funds to the Parent in the form of dividends, debt repayments or advances other than such restrictions as might arise from the financing agreements of those associates or from their own financial situation, and there are no contingent liabilities relating to associates and joint ventures that might ultimately be assumed by the Group.

a) Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2019 totalled EUR 2,619,500 thousand (2018: EUR 4,641,250 thousand), and the fixed interest rates ranged from 0.65% to 4.12% (2018: from 0.39% to 4.11%) with the Euribor as the main floating interest reference rate.

117

It should be noted that in December 2018 Abertis, in anticipation of future debt issues to be carried out in 2019, arranged new interest rate swaps for a total of EUR 3,500 million, which were classified as hedges since the requirements for such classification were met given, inter alia, that these debt issues were considered to be highly probable transactions. In 2019 debt issues maturing between 2024 and 2032 were performed and a portion of the aforementioned financial swaps totalling EUR 2,000 million was settled.
Thus, at 2019 year-end interest rate swaps totalling EUR 1,500 million remained outstanding, which were classified as hedges since it was deemed that the requirements for such classification continued to be met, in anticipation of future debt issues in 2020. These issues would be performed throughout 2020, and it is expected that they will expire between 2025 and 2033.
Lastly, it should be noted that in 2018 Túnels de Barcelona i Cadí, Concessionària de la Generalitat de Catalunya, S.A. (Túnels), which is in the process of refinancing its bank debt, arranged new interest rate swaps totalling EUR 48,750 thousand expiring in 2034 and bearing fixed interest at 1.54%.
b) Cross currency interest rate swaps
In 2019 the following interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions were settled in advance:
 Abertis India settled early derivative financial instruments in Indian rupees amounting to INR 6,341,800 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 90,000 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in several cross currency interest rate swaps, which were designated as hedges of the net investment made with the acquisition of TTPL and JEPL. These hedges were set to expire in 2022.
 In addition, Metropistas settled early various cash flow hedges for a nominal amount at 2018 year-end of USD 251,996 thousand (with an equivalent euro value of EUR 220,084 thousand) which converted a floating rate debt to a fixed rate debt maturing in 2026.
 In addition, in 2019 Abertis settled its hedges in Chilean pesos (CLP 350,747,024 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 409,053 thousand at 2018 year-end). The hedges were instrumented in several cross currency interest rate swaps, which were designated as a partial hedge of the net investment made in various Chilean companies. The hedges were set to expire between 2019 and 2021.
118

 In this respect, Abertis settled the cross currency interest rate swaps that were designated as hedges of the net investment in Metropistas, for a nominal amount of USD 37,780 thousand and an equivalent euro value of EUR 27,759 thousand at 2018 year-end.
In addition, the following transactions were performed in 2019:
 Abertis arranged a cross currency interest rate swap for GBP 400,000 thousand and an equivalent euro value of EUR 467,181 thousand to hedge a bond issue of GBP 400,000 thousand (Note 16).
 Abertis arranged hedges in Mexican pesos for MXN 32,100,000 thousand and an equivalent euro value of EUR 1,450,354 thousand, instrumented in various forward rate agreements, to hedge the disbursement envisaged in relation to the investment commitment acquired in October 2019 in relation to the acquisition of the RCO Group which it is estimated will become effective in the first six months of 2020. It should be noted in this regard that these financial instruments were classified as hedges since the requirements for such classification were met given, inter alia, that the aforementioned investment commitment is considered to constitute a highly probable transaction.
 In addition, Abertis mantains several cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its net investment in the Arteris Group in Brazil. These hedges have a nominal value of BRL 673,300 thousand and an equivalent euro value of EUR 215,000 thousand and expire between 2020 and 2022. In this respect, in 2019 Abertis renewed hedges in Brazilian reais amounting to BRL 129,150 thousand (an equivalent euro value of EUR 40,000 thousand), while hedges for a nominal value of BRL 239,679 thousand (an equivalent euro value of EUR 80,000 thousand) expired.
 In December 2019 Emovis, S.A.S arranged forward rate agreements for GBP 15,000 thousand (EUR 17,629 thousand at 2019 year-end) expiring in 2020.
In addition, in 2018 no interest rate and/or cross currency swaps were settled early, and the notional principal amount was not increased as a result of the arrangement of new instruments.
119

In this regard, in 2018 the interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions carried out in the year included most notably the following:
 Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Chilean pesos amounting to CLP 206,824,975 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 239,250 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in a cross currency interest rate swap, which is designated as a partial hedge of the net investment made in various Chilean companies. Following that renewal, these hedges were scheduled to expire in 2019 and 2021.
 Abertis renewed derivative financial instruments in Brazilian reais amounting to BRL 524,138 thousand with an equivalent euro value of EUR 175,000 thousand. The hedges were instrumented in cross currency interest rate swaps, which were designated as hedges of the net investment in Arteris. Following that renewal, these hedges were scheduled to expire in 2019 and 2020.
 Arteris renewed an interest rate and foreign currency swap for a nominal value of EUR 44,704 thousand, whereby it converted a loan of USD 50 million bearing fixed interest into a debt in Brazilian reais and bearing floating interest tied to the CDI rate. Following that renewal, the hedge expires in 2020.
Also, no interest rate and/or cross currency swap transactions expired in 2018. As a result of all the foregoing, the detail of the main interest rate and/or cross currency swaps held by the Group at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

(2) Including the impacts relating to the recognition of the modification of the concession arrangements held by the Argentine consolidated companies Ausol and GCO under the IFRIC 12 financial asset model at their fair value upon their execution, net of the value of the unamortised intangible asset associated with the aforementioned concession arrangements.
(3) Including in 2019 a positive impact of EUR 6,497 thousand due to the net revaluation recognised with effect from 1 January 2019 associated with the gain of control of Abertis and the subsequent merger with Abertis Participaciones (see Note 6).
(4) The transfers in 2018 included mainly the impact associated with the recognition of the modification of to the concession arrangements of Ausol and GCO mentioned above.

"Concession Arrangements - Financial Asset Model" includes the amounts receivable from grantors under various agreements entered into with them (toll rebates, free services, compensation and other). Some of these agreements were recognised, in accordance with IFRIC 12, as a receivable from the grantor through application of either the bifurcated model or the financial asset model, as indicated in Note 3-d.ii. These balances receivable earn the related interest.

At the end of each reporting period a portion of these balances receivable from public authorities is subject to review as part of the audits performed by the grantor.

a) Royal Decree 457/2006 (Acesa)
Royal Decree 457/2006 approved the Agreement between the Spanish Government and Acesa to modify certain terms of the Barcelona-La Jonquera, Barcelona-Tarragona, Montmeló-El Papiol and ZaragozaMediterráneo toll road concessions.

125

This Agreement envisages, inter alia, the building of an additional lane on certain stretches of the AP-7 toll road, implementing a closed-toll system and granting free transit and discounts in certain cases, as well as Acesa's waiver of its right to claim any possible indemnities as a result of the effect that the construction of second lanes on the N-II and CN-340 roads might have on traffic.
The Agreement establishes that the difference in revenue resulting from the variance between actual traffic and the amount of traffic specified in the Royal Decree until the end of the concession will be added to or subtracted from the investments made in the compensation account created to restore the economic and financial balance that was altered by the obligations assumed by Acesa. The adjusted amount in this compensation account will be received by the concession operator at the end of the concession, once the term of the concession has expired, if the economic and financial balance has not been restored.
The grantor thus secured the undertaking of the concession operator to carry out extension work not included in the concession arrangement, to waive any indemnity that it might be entitled to receive as a result of parallel roads and to give certain rebates and discounts. The grantor is not, however, required to make any payment for the projects and waivers, although it is required to assume a risk relating to the possibility that traffic might not exceed certain thresholds.
The detail of the balance of the compensation at 31 December 2019 and 2018 for each of the items of which it is composed, without considering the accounting effects derived from the net revaluation recorded with effect 1 January 2019 associated with the takeover of Abertis and its subsequent merger with Abertis Participaciones (see Note 6), as well as the theoretical changes in line with the Group's interpretation under Royal Decree 457/2006 of this compensation balance is as follows:

(1) As detailed in this section, since 1 January 2015, compensation for guaranteed traffic ceased to be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss; the related balance at 31 December 2014 was also provisioned in full in 2015. The foregoing detail shows the balance of compensation for guaranteed traffic at 31 December 2018 based on the Group's interpretation of Royal Decree 457/2006 despite the discrepancies with the Spanish Ministry of Public Works.
Lastly, this figure will increase or decrease until the end of the concession based on the difference between actual traffic and the traffic levels envisaged in Royal Decree 457/2006.

Previously, Royal Decree 457/2006 and the Agreement that it approved received favourable reports from the various technical services of the Ministries of Public Works and Finance as well as from the Government Advisory Council. Although the latter acknowledged the unique nature of this contractual amendment based on the transfer of traffic risk, it expressly stated that it did not object to it on legal grounds.

Following its approval, the Agreement was interpreted in the same way by both parties and both the review by the Regional Government Office of the toll road concession operators of the Ministry of Public Works ("Administrative Review") as well as the audits of the financial statements of Acesa for 2006 until 2010, confirmed that the calculation of the compensation and the accounting treatment of the compensation account provided for in the Agreement were correct.

127

However, although the Administrative Review of 2011 recognised the amounts accrued in the year and the compensation balance payable to Acesa at 31 December 2011, calculated using the same methodology, it raised questions as to the interpretation of the compensation for guaranteed revenue arising from the decrease in traffic as a result of the economic downturn and proposed that a provision be recognised for this revenue until these issues were clarified. Acesa filed an administrative appeal to a superior administrative body against this Administrative Review, which was dismissed in 2015. The ruling dismissing the appeal filed stated that any Administrative Review of Acesa would be in line with the decision of the Government Advisory Council requested in the framework of the Administrative Review of 2013 described below ("2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council"). Therefore, this ruling meant, on the one hand, not considering the guaranteed traffic compensation (and the related interest cost) as an integral part of the Agreement and, on the other, the existence of certain discrepancies in relation to the accounting treatment of the investments made and the recognition of the related interest cost. Acesa filed an appeal for judicial review at the Madrid High Court against that ruling which was upheld in full on 7 March 2017 and, therefore, rendered null and void the Administrative Review of 2011 and, in the same way as the 2006 decision of the Government Advisory Council (therefore contradicting the 2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council), held that the AP-7 Agreement was valid and effective for all purposes. The Ministry of Public Works filed a cassation appeal against this judgment at the Supreme Court, on which a judgment was handed down on 12 February 2020, upholding the cassation appeal by the Ministry of Public Works and thereby rendering null and void the judgment of 7 March 2017. The stance taken in the judgment was that the reviews by the Regional Government Office were acts merely for information purposes and not binding upon the concession operators and that the review of 2011 that held that the balances under the Agreement should be deemed to be an intangible asset and, therefore, the balance that should be paid to the concession operator would not be known until 31 August 2021, should be maintained. Acesa disagrees with this judgment and will initiate the proceedings it considers appropriate in accordance with the law to challenge it. It will also continue to recognise for accounting purposes the balances arising from Royal Decree 457/2006 as a financial asset in accordance with the applicable standards since it takes the view that the opinion and information from the 2011 review issued by the Regional Government Office are incorrect and contrary to applicable Spanish and European accounting standards, which are applicable to the Company. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the eventual application of the criterion set by the Supreme Court would not imply any capital impact on the consolidated annual accounts attached as it is a mere reclassification of the theoretical book value pending
128

amortization at December 31, 2019 in view of the guarantee if recognized by the Council of Ministers as described below.
Also, the Administrative Review for 2012 did not include any recommendation to recognise a provision, although it did reiterate the matters referred to in the Administrative Review for 2011.
In the Administrative Review for 2013 Acesa was informed that the Ministry of Public Works had requested an opinion from the Government Advisory Council with a view to resolving the differences of interpretation raised in the Administrative Review for 2011 and raising the possibility of unilaterally modifying the agreement entered into with Acesa.
Subsequently, the Administrative Reviews of 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 confirmed the stance adopted in the 2014 decision of the Government Advisory Council, in relation to both the balance of the compensation and the investments made and the related interest cost. Acesa filed appeals to a superior administrative body against these Administrative Reviews; however, since these appeals were not expressly resolved by the Government by the corresponding deadline, Acesa filed appeals for judicial review.
With respect to the 2014 Administrative Review, on 14 March 2018 the Madrid High Court upheld in full the accounting policy applied by Acesa in relation to the balance of the aforementioned Agreement. The Ministry of Public Works filed a cassation appeal against this judgment, on which a judgment had not yet been handed down at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.
With respect to the 2015 Administrative Review, as in relation to the 2014 Administrative Review, on 23 November 2018 the Madrid High Court upheld in full the accounting policy applied by Acesa in relation to the balance of the aforementioned Agreement. The Ministry of Public Works filed a cassation appeal against this judgment, which had not been handed down at the date of drawing these consolidated financial statements.
With respect to the Administrative Reviews of 2016 and 2017, on 24 April 2018 and 30 April 2019, respectively, Acesa filed the corresponding appeals for judicial review at the Madrid High Court on which judgments had not been handed down at the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements.
129

Also, it should be noted that on 11 July 2019 Acesa received the proposed Administrative Review of 2018, which is in line with the Administrative Reviews of 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and, consequently, different stances were maintained with respect to the accounting treatment of the investments made and the related interest cost and tax effect (see Note 13.i). On 7 August 2019, Acesa filed the corresponding administrative appeal against that 2018 Administrative Review to a superior administrative body; however, at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements no decision had yet been handed down.
Moreover, in connection with the request submitted by the Ministry of Public Works to the Government Advisory Council within the framework of the Administrative Review of 2013 described above, in 2015 the Group was informed of the following opinions and reports issued at the request of the Ministry of Public Works:
i) Report from the Spanish State Legal Service as to whether the compensation formula could be revised ex officio in order to exclude the effect of the decrease in traffic resulting from the economic downturn and, if not, whether the Royal Decree and the Agreement could be amended unilaterally pursuant to the Spanish Toll Roads Law or the "rebus sic stantibus" clause.
The State Legal Service issued the requested report, stating that:
a) A review of the compensation formula governed by the Royal Decree and the Agreement was not warranted, since the amendment was contractually valid (as deemed by the 2006 opinion of the Government Advisory Council, insofar as it did not object on legal grounds to the exclusion of the risk corresponding to the concession operator) and because the four-year deadline for declaring it detrimental to the public interest had elapsed.
b) Unilaterally amending the Royal Decree and the Agreement which it approved would also not be warranted, either under the Toll Roads Law or under the "rebus sic stantibus" clause. Regarding the latter, the report stated that a decrease in traffic is not a wholly unforeseeable circumstance, given that the nature of this factor is to fluctuate and vary, especially over a period as lengthy as 16 years.
Accordingly, in 2014 the State Legal Service concluded, as had the Government lawyer for the Ministry of Public Works in 2006 and the opinion of the Government Advisory Council in 2006, that the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006 is valid and legally effective, and therefore it may not be unilaterally amended by the grantor.
130

ii) A new opinion from the Government Advisory Council, that concludes, among other aspects, that: (a) the concession operator does not have a vested right to the annual compensation balances and, consequently, any financial statements that include amounts accrued as a result of decreased toll road traffic should not receive a favourable review from the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators; (b) the compensation system set forth in the Agreement does not cover possible compensation for decreases in toll road traffic other than decreases that are caused by the doubling of the N-II and CN-340 roads (which, in the opinion of the Government Advisory Council, has not occurred) and that exceed the maximum amount of the investments made; (c) since there has been no imbalance in the performance of the Agreement, the Agreement should not be unilaterally amended; and (d) in the case of the Agreement in question, the provisions set out in Directive 2014/23/EU of 26 February on the award of concession contracts must be taken into account.
The new decision of the Government Advisory Council in 2014 expressly rendered its previous 2006 decision null and void. It justified, from a legal standpoint, its change of stance on the basis that the novation agreement to amend the Agreement does not permit the traffic risk to be transferred, that the regulated participating loans subsequently rendered the forecasts of guaranteed traffic set forth in the Agreement void, and that Directive 2014/23/EU of 26 February on the award of concession contracts requires the concession operator to assume the demand risk. Accordingly, it does not accept the compensation balance for guaranteed traffic, which at 31 December 2019 stood at EUR 2,377 million, excluding the related tax effect (31 December 2018: EUR 2,061 million).
However, the Government Advisory Council does state that the concession operator may prepare and approve its financial statements as it deems fit. However, it emphasises that non-approval of the Administrative Review applies if the same accounting policy continues to be used, and that if the Ministry considers that the compensation account included the effect of the decrease in traffic it may amend Royal Decree 457/2006 and the Agreement using administrative powers, including the application of the "rebus sic stantibus" clause.
131

Also, in relation to the foregoing and in view of the differing interpretations made by the parties, on 29 June 2015 a written request was submitted to the Spanish Cabinet through the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators in Spain asking that it exercise its powers of interpretation regarding Acesa's concession arrangement, with respect to the correct understanding of the compensation clause included in the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006, in order to include the guaranteed traffic expressly agreed in the arrangement in the compensation account. In this connection, on 30 September 2015, Acesa filed an appeal for judicial review at the Supreme Court against the dismissal of the request submitted to the Spanish Cabinet due to administrative silence in relation to the query that had been filed.
As a result of the request submitted on 29 June 2015, the Regional Government Office for toll road concession operators in Spain initiated on 28 March 2017 a proceeding relating to the interpretation of the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006, and a reply brief was filed by Acesa and sent to the Government Advisory Council so that a decision could be handed down in in this regard. On 3 July 2017, the Spanish Cabinet announced that it had adopted a decision against the interpretation of the Agreement by Acesa. This decision confirms, therefore, the decision to reject the request for interpretation previously challenged at the Supreme Court and can only be perceived for legal purposes as being included in the obligation incumbent upon any government to decide on proceedings brought by the interested parties, since rejection by the administrative silence route does not release the Government from the obligation to comply with its duty to hand down an express decision.
In view of the above, Acesa requested the Supreme Court to extend the appeal to the content of the express decision issued by the Spanish Cabinet, which was accepted by the Supreme Court, giving rise to the reopening of the initial submissions proceeding at the Court. In this connection, on 4 June 2019 the Supreme Court handed down a judgment whereby the solution was postponed until August 2021 (when Acesa's concession ends), taking the view that it was not appropriate to make any type of interpretation at this time but only at the end of the concession, thereby not expressly accepting the interpretation considered by the Ministry of Public Works. In any event, Acesa is, if possible, even more convinced after this of the soundness of its legal arguments, based on the Agreement itself that the granting authority and the concession operator signed for reasons of general interest.
132

With regard to the aforementioned decisions and the interpretation ruling issued by the Spanish Cabinet on 3 July 2017, it should be emphasised that the position of the State Legal Service-Government Legal Services Office is in line with the stance adopted in various external reports that the concession operator commissioned and made available to the grantor. These reports were issued by Government lawyers, lawyers of the Government Advisory Council and Parliament and jurists of recognised prestige and experience, such as Juan José Lavilla and José María Barrios (Clifford Chance), Benigno Blanco and Jesús Trillo-Figueroa (Iuris C.T.), Jordi de Juan, and Alicia de Carlos (Cuatrecasas Abogados and MA Abogados). The same stance was taken by the law firms Pérez-Llorca and Uría Menéndez in the legal report they issued at the request of CVC prior to the purchase of its package of shares in 2010. These reports also agreed with those issued by the Government lawyers and by members of various governing bodies of the Company, i.e., Ricard Fornesa, Mónica López-Monís and Josep Maria Coronas.
In addition, the accounting policies applied by the Company received a favourable report from the current auditors (Deloitte) as well as the previous auditors (PWC), and from other accounting experts of recognised prestige, such as Enrique Ortega (Gómez Acebo & Pombo) and Sergio Aranda and Tamara Seijo (PWC).
Also, the statutory auditor's reports on the financial statements of Acesa for the years ended 31 December 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were not qualified in this connection.
Acesa emphasises that, in addition to the rigour of, and agreement between, the various public and private opinions issued previously, including those of the Government Advisory Council in 2006 and of the State Legal Service-Government Legal Services Office in 2014, Royal Decree 457/2006 expressly acknowledges that when it came force "the configuration of the concession changed", based on the guaranteed traffic. Also, the participating loans referred to by the Government Advisory Council in its decision of 17 December 2014 and regulated by the Budget Laws did not refer to Acesa. There is no mechanism that enables the application thereof in its favour and they were unconnected with the effects of the Agreement. Furthermore, with respect to the 2014 Directive (also mentioned in the decision) it should be noted that its transposition into Spanish domestic legislation in 2017, under no circumstances, enables it to be applied retrospectively, an issue included in 2015 by Jordi de Juan, Alicia de Carlos and MA Abogados in their opinions, when they updated their reports in light of the new decision of the Government Advisory Council.
133

Despite the foregoing, considering that the stance of the Ministry of Public Works questions the guaranteed traffic compensation balance (and the recognition of the related interest cost), on which the parties have different interpretations, an impairment loss was recognised in Acesa in 2015, amounting to EUR 982 million at 31 December 2014 and the compensation ceased to be recognised in profit or loss on the investee company from 1 January 2015 onwards. This stance was maintained by the Group at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements and it is expected to be maintained until the various court proceedings in progress have been resolved.
Lastly, in relation to the aspects of the balance on which the parties do not have differing interpretations regarding their validity, i.e., the investments made and the related interest cost, but with respect to which they do have differences regarding their accounting treatment, the treatment applied in previous years was maintained.
In any case and notwithstanding the impairment loss recognised in prior years by Acesa, Acesa and Abertis understand that the legal grounds that have always supported the legal validity of the compensation balance remain sound. As they have always done, they will attempt to reach a solution with the Government that protects their interests and those of their shareholders and, if this were not possible, they will defend such interests as appropriate in court and all other instances of appeal.
b) Royal Decree 1132/1986 (Aumar)
Although no receivables had been recognised for accounting purposes by Aumar at 31 December 2019 (as at 31 December 2018), it must be stated that on 18 February 2011 Aumar submitted a request to the Spanish Government for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility of the AP7/AP4 concession which it managed (see Note 27-c) as a result of the impacts on the economic basis of the contracts arising from the construction of roads running in parallel, which had not been subject to a waiver included in the Agreement approved by Royal Decree 457/2006 (see Note 13-a).
134

To this end, Aumar requested the adoption of measures required to restore the economic and financial feasibility that had been lost in order to offset in full the losses suffered as a result of the loss of traffic and revenue; and, secondarily, if the measures requested were not adopted, the acknowledgement of its right to damages as a result of breach of the related contractual terms and conditions. The aforementioned damages should include the amount for the loss of revenue from 2002 to the end of the concession in 2019.
The request for the aforementioned restoration of the economic and financial feasibility was initially dismissed by the Regional Government Office for Spanish toll road concession operators. In view of this situation, Aumar filed an administrative appeal to a superior administrative body which was only partially upheld by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure and Transport on behalf of the Ministry of Public Works, due to a material lack of jurisdiction, since it was a matter submitted to the Spanish Cabinet for its consideration and decision.
In November 2014 Aumar received a proposal from the Ministry of Public Works dismissing its request for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility, although it was granted a hearing. Aumar submitted the related pleadings at the hearing, defending the soundness of the grounds for its case based on the damage caused by actions taken by the Government that were unforeseen when the concession arrangement was entered into. Since the Spanish Cabinet did not hand down an express decision within the legally required period, on 22 July 2015 Aumar filed an appeal for judicial review at the Supreme Court, since it considered that there were sound legal arguments for defending its rights and legitimate interests, together with those of Abertis and its shareholders.
On 18 March 2016, the Spanish Cabinet handed down an express decision dismissing the claim for the restoration of the economic and financial feasibility submitted by Aumar. In this connection, the appeal for judicial review already filed was extended to the express decision mentioned above, and on 22 May 2019 an unfavourable judgment was handed down by the Supreme Court. Aumar submitted a motion for annulment at the Supreme Court which was not successful, and lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights at the Constitutional Court on the basis that the lack of grounds for the judgment handed down could violate its right to due process of law. In this regard, on 17 February 2020 the aforementioned appeal has been inadmissible for processing; being notified to the Company on 26 February 2020.
135

c) Royal Decree 483/1995 (Invicat) Royal Decree 483/1995 sets forth the Agreement entered into in January 2010 between Invicat and the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government and includes a schedule containing a framework cooperation agreement setting forth the general conditions for modifying and adapting the stretch of the C-32 toll road between Palafolls and the junction with the GI-600 road that is being widened, in addition to other road and mobility management improvements linked to the toll road and its operation in the Maresme corridor. In the framework of the aforementioned Agreement, on 19 March 2015 a new Agreement was entered into to include the construction, upkeep and operation of a new toll-free access road connecting the toll road with Blanes and Lloret de Mar. The investments to be made are estimated to total EUR 96 million (at 2010 prices) (at 31 December 2019, the investment made amounted to EUR 29,281 thousand, as compared with EUR 27,263 thousand at 2018 year-end). The C-32 toll road Agreement provides that any additional revenue stemming from the increased capacity of the toll road shall be used for restoring the economic and financial balance altered by the work provided for in the Agreement. It also sets out the procedure for calculating the economic compensation that the concession operator would receive if, once the concession term had ended, the economic and financial balance had not been restored.
136

d) Government Agreement 185/2013 (Invicat) and Government Agreement 186/2013 (Aucat)
In early 2014 the Agreement with the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government entered into by Invicat (Royal Decree 185/2013), the concession operator of the Montgat-Palafolls up to the GI-600 (C-31/C-32) and Barcelona-Montmeló (C-33) toll roads and by Aucat (Royal Decree 186/2013), the concession operator of the Pau Casals (C-32, CastelldefelsSitges-El Vendrell) toll road, came into force. These Agreements provide for the implementation of a uniform toll system and a closed-toll system in which users pay on the basis of the stretch of road they use, as well as a series of auxiliary projects, an exemption on payment of tolls by regular publictransportation passenger vehicles operating under administrative concessions and, in the case of Aucat, compensation for the loss of property tax rebate. The investments to be made were estimated to total approximately EUR 100 million (at 2014 prices) (at 31 December 2019, the investment made amounted to EUR 26,783 thousand, as compared with EUR 23,971 thousand at 2018 year-end).
As with other agreements, this Agreement provides for the restoration of the economic and financial balance that has been altered by the work that it envisages, using a compensation account that will be settled on expiry of the concession.
e) Royal Decree 971/2011 (Castellana)
Royal Decree 971/2011, of 1 July, amends certain terms of the administrative concession operated by Castellana (construction, maintenance and operation of the section of the AP-6 toll road that connects with Segovia (AP-61) and the section of the AP-6 toll road that connects with Ávila (AP-51), as well as the maintenance and operation, from 30 January 2018, of the Villalba-Adanero stretch of the AP-6 toll road), to offset cost overruns for additional work, as set forth in Additional Provision Forty-One of 2010 General Budget Law 26/2009, of 23 December, through which the General Directorate of Roads acknowledged the need for additional work for the toll road construction project not initially foreseen amounting to EUR 89,018 thousand.
137

This Royal Decree was intended to restore the economic and financial feasibility of the concession affected by the additional work that had to be carried out. To this end, in light of the situation of the concession, it was considered that the most appropriate course of action was to extend the period during which the AP-6 toll road tolls would apply, regulated by the Agreements approved by Royal Decree 315/2004, of 20 February, and Royal Decree 1467/2008, of 29 August, in both cases until the aforementioned cost overruns resulting from the additional work amounting to EUR 89,018 thousand and the interest for the delay in the payment to restore the economic balance as a result of this, amounting to EUR 29,471 thousand, had been offset.
f) Minimum guaranteed revenue and other guarantees in the concession arrangement (application of the bifurcated model)
In addition, the Chilean toll road concession operators Elqui and Libertadores have an account relating to the minimum guaranteed revenue and other guarantees established in the concession arrangements. These amounts are recognised as a financial asset as a result of applying the bifurcated model in accordance with IFRIC 12, as described in Note 3-b.ii.
g) Ausol and Gco arrangements
As described in Note 27-c, on 24 July 2018 the concession arrangements held by the Argentine consolidated companies Ausol and GCO were modified. Under the terms of the agreement reached, the applicable model under IFRIC 12 is the financial asset model since Ausol and GCO are granted an unconditional right to receive an amount from the grantor (in accordance with the application of the financial asset model described in Note 3-b.ii). In this respect, the agreement resulted in the recognition of a financial asset in accordance with IFRIC 12 at the fair value upon execution of the agreement, net of the value of the unamortised intangible asset associated with the aforementioned concession arrangements (indicated in section i) above).
The variation of the year includes the effect of the capitalization of the interests of the year, as well as the effect of the expected loss recorded in accordance with IFRS 9 as a result of the deterioration of Argentina's economic situation (Note 22.e)
138

h) Other "Concession Arrangements - Financial Asset Model - Other" relates to the balance receivable by the Group under Section B of Schedule 3 of the Agreement entered into by Acesa and the Spanish Government (Royal Decree 457/2006) whereby the latter compensates Acesa with respect to the income tax it pays in relation to the interest expense on the balance. Lastly, at 31 December 2019, "Current Assets - Concession Arrangements Financial Asset Model" includes a past-due balance of EUR 38,248 thousand (primarily at toll road concession operators) for which an allowance has not been recognised because it is considered that it will be duly paid by the related grantor (2018 year-end: EUR 34,393 thousand, for which, similarly, no allowance had been recognised). In this respect, on 8 January 2020 EUR 33,579 thousand were collected in relation to the agreement contained in Royal Decree 1467/2008 signed on 29 August 2008 between Iberpistas and the Spanish Government.

The impairment recognised in the period amounting to EUR 139,198 thousand (EUR 132,916 thousand in 2018) relates mainly to the recognition of the expected credit losses associated with the concession arrangements which, in accordance with IFRIC 12, were recognised as financial assets. In this respect, the Group recognised expected credit losses on the financial assets associated with the concession arrangements of Ausol and GCO (see section i) above) amounting to EUR 140 million, in view of the significant worsening of the macroeconomic situation in Argentina and of the counterparty's credit risk since the initial recognition of the arrangements, resulting in the calculation of the losses over the entire term of the arrangement in accordance with IFRS 9 (see Note 22-e). With respect to the expected credit losses associated with the other financial assets, according to the analysis performed by the Group in 2019, there was no significant increase in the credit risk. There were no changes in the estimation techniques or the main assumptions used in assessing expected losses in 2019.
145

14. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The breakdown of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Cash on hand and at banks Bank deposits maturing within three months Cash and cash equivalents

2019
1,683,864 961,025
2,644,889

2018
1,811,304 925,766
2,737,070

The balance of this heading at 31 December 2019 and 2018 relates mainly to the following companies/subgroups:

Abertis Infraestructuras A4 subgroup (Italy) Abertis Chile subgroup (Chile) Arteris subgroup (Brazil) HIT/Sanef subgroup (France) Other Cash and cash equivalents

2019
1,651,130 292,601 279,852 127,032 52,045 242,229
2,644,889

2018
1,133,310 229,979 494,859 235,074 441,375 202,473
2,737,070

"Cash and Cash Equivalents" reflects a decrease in 2019, mainly as a result of investments made, ordinary dividend payments and debt repayments, which were partially offset by the sale of 89.68% of Hispasat, resulting in a cash inflow of EUR 933 million.

In this regard, the increase in cash at Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is due mainly to the impact of the aforementioned sale of 89.68% of Hispasat, as well as the impact of various financing transactions carried out at the end of the year, of which EUR 500 million had not yet been drawn down at 2019 year-end. The decrease in the Hit subgroup's cash was due mainly to the payment in December 2019 of EUR 465 million in dividends to Abertis, as well as returns of contributions for 110 million euros. In the case of Chile, the reduction in cash was affected by the payment of EUR 196 million by Invin to its non-controlling shareholder.

(2) Company at 31 December 2018 wholly owned by Abertis HoldCo, S.A which in 2019 has been absorbed by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. as described in Notes 1 and 6, the merger being effective with accounting effect 1 January, 2019.

149

Following the aforementioned merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., Abertis HoldCo, S.A. directly held 98.7% of the share capital of Abertis (until then held indirectly through Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.).
In 2018, the Board of Directors of Abertis called a General Meeting of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. for 25 July 2018 at which, inter alia, the shareholders were asked to approve a reduction of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by EUR -236,448 thousand through the retirement of the 78,815,937 treasury shares (representing 7.9581% of its share capital) held by the Group at 30 June 2018 amounting to EUR 1,168,679 thousand, which also had an impact of EUR -932,231 thousand on the Group's reserves (overall, no impact on the Group's equity).
In this respect, on 25 September 2018 the Board of Directors, exercising the powers delegated by the aforementioned Extraordinary General Meeting, agreed to this capital reduction, which was performed with a charge to voluntary or unrestricted reserves, and the requisite reserve for retired capital was recognised for an amount equal to the par value of the treasury shares effectively retired (EUR 236 million), which will only become unrestricted if the requirements for capital reductions provided for in Article 335.c) of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law are met.
At the same meeting the shareholders approved the delisting of shares representing all the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. from the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges, a measure that was completed on 6 August 2018 when all the shares of Abertis were delisted from those Stock Exchanges. Until that date the shares had been traded on the Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System as they had been excluded from the IBEX-35 index on 9 May 2018 as a result of the tender offer (described below) in which Abertis was involved in the year.
Also of note in 2018 were, on the one hand, the completion of the tender offer in which the Parent had been engaged since 2017 and, on the other, the agreement for the merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. with its shareholder Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., completed in 2019 as detailed above (see Note 1). The following should be noted in this connection:
150

Tender offer
Atlantia tender offer
 On 15 May 2017 the Italian company Atlantia, S.p.A. announced its decision to launch a tender offer for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. Under the terms and conditions of this tender offer detailed in the prospectus authorised by the CNMV on 9 October 2017, Atlantia offered the shareholders of Abertis the possibility of choosing between the following three alternative types of consideration: (i) cash consideration consisting of the payment of EUR 16.50 per share of Abertis; (ii) consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia (par value of EUR 1 per share) determined on the basis of a share exchange ratio of 0.697 special shares of Atlantia for every share of Abertis; and (iii) a combination of alternatives (i) and (ii). However, only the holders of a maximum of 230,000,000 shares of Abertis (23.22% of the total) could opt to receive the consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia. Also, the effectiveness of Atlantia's offer was conditional upon holders of a minimum of 100,000,000 shares of Abertis (10.10% of its share capital) accepting the consideration in the form of special shares of Atlantia. In addition, Atlantia made the effectiveness of its tender offer conditional upon acquiring a minimum of 50% plus one share of the shares of Abertis. On 18 October 2017, the Board of Directors of Abertis issued a detailed and reasoned report on Atlantia's tender offer in which it stated that it considered the offer to be positive from the industrial standpoint and the amount of the cash consideration to be reasonable on the basis of a fundamental analysis of Abertis (as also reflected by the fairness opinions received from AZ Capital, S.L., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International, plc.). However, it was considered that there was room for improvement in Atlantia's offer, as also evidenced by the positive performance from the time the offer was announced: (i) of the price of the shares of Abertis; and (ii) the difference in the share exchange ratio with respect to the cash consideration.
151

Hochtief tender offer
 On 18 October 2017, the German company Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (Hochtief) presented a rival offer also for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., upon which the acceptance period for the aforementioned tender offer launched by Atlantia was suspended. Under the terms and conditions of this tender offer detailed in the prospectus authorised by the CNMV on 12 March 2018, having considered the adjustment for the dividend paid by Abertis prior to the completion of the tender offer, Hochtief also offered the shareholders of Abertis the possibility of choosing between the following three alternative types of consideration: (i) cash consideration that would consist of a payment of EUR 18.36 per share of Abertis; (ii) consideration in the form of ordinary shares of Hochtief based on a share exchange ratio of 0.1254 ordinary shares of Hochtief for each share of Abertis; and (iii) a combination of alternatives (i) and (ii). In this case, only 193,530,179 shares of Abertis (19.54% of the total) could opt for the shares of Hochtief, this being the maximum and minimum acceptances in the form of shares of Hochtief that Hochtief would permit. In other words, should the holders of more than 193,530,179 shares of Abertis opt for shares of Hochtief, the shares would be apportioned on a pro rata basis, and should the acceptance be lower, Hochtief would be entitled to withdraw its offer. In addition, Hochtief made the effectiveness of its tender offer conditional upon acquiring a minimum of 50% plus one share of the shares of Abertis. Also, Hochtief announced its intention to exercise its squeeze-out right if it achieved the legally required acceptance threshold and, if the threshold were not reached, its intention to exclude the shares of Abertis from trading. The Board of Directors of Abertis also had to draft a detailed and reasoned report on the tender offer of Hochtief explaining, among other matters, its opinion regarding the pros and cons of the offer and the reasonableness of the price offered by Hochtief, although the report was ultimately prepared in connection with Hochtief's modified tender offer, as detailed below.
152

Modification of the Hochtief tender offer and withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer

 On 14 March 2018, Hochtief announced changes to its tender offer, having reached a binding agreement in principle with Atlantia and Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) to make a joint investment in Abertis; the agreement was simultaneously ratified and approved by the respective Boards of Directors of Hochtief, Atlantia and ACS on 14 March 2018.
The agreement entered into was structured on the basis of the following principles:

i.

Modification of the consideration offered

Hochtief modified its offer by eliminating the "consideration in the form of shares" (and the concomitant condition concerning the choice of this form of consideration by the holders of a specified percentage of the share capital of Abertis) and, therefore, the price of the tender offer, which remained unaltered at EUR 18.36 per Abertis share, became payable in full in cash.

ii. Holding company

Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief would contribute capital of approximately EUR 7,000 million to a jointly owned holding company that would subsequently acquire from Hochtief its entire ownership interest in Abertis for the same price as that paid by Hochtief in the tender offer and in subsequent share purchases (adjusted by such gross dividends as might be paid).

The share capital of this company would be owned as follows: (i) Atlantia 50% plus one share; (ii) ACS 30%; and (iii) Hochtief 20% minus one share. Also, the parties would enter into a shareholders agreement with a view to regulating their relationships as shareholders of the jointly owned holding company.

iii. Injection of capital and investment by Atlantia in Hochtief

Hochtief would increase capital by approximately 6.35 million shares, which would be subscribed in full by ACS for EUR 143.04 per share. Also, ACS would sell for the same price to Atlantia shares of Hochtief for a total value of up to EUR 2,411 million.

153

iv. Strategic cooperation agreement Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief would enter into a long-term agreement with a view to maximising strategic relations and synergies between the parties and Abertis in new public-private partnerships both in projects at the tendering and construction phases and projects in the operating phase.
v. Withdrawal of the Atlantia tender offer On the basis of the aforementioned agreements, Atlantia would withdraw its tender offer for Abertis shares described above.
As a result of all of the above, on 12 April 2018, on the one hand, Atlantia, by virtue of the aforementioned agreements, withdrew its voluntary tender offer for Abertis shares described above and, on the other, the CNMV authorised Hochtief's voluntary tender offer for Abertis shares, which became the only surviving tender offer. Also, the CNMV extended the period for accepting the Hochtief tender offer until 8 May 2018, the date on which it was completed. Also, on 16 April 2018 the Board of Directors of Abertis issued a detailed and reasoned report on the modified tender offer of Hochtief stating that it considered the offer to be positive, highlighting that it deemed the amount of the cash consideration to be reasonable and included a share premium of 33% of the average Abertis share price in the six months preceding 13 April 2017 (the day before the publication of the relevant event communication announcing the potential Atlantia tender offer, following the speculation that had appeared in the press), considerations that were also supported by the fairness opinions received from AZ Capital, S.L., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International, plc. This report was published on 17 April 2018. Lastly, on 14 May 2018 the CNMV published the result of the tender offer launched by Hochtief for all the shares of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., which had been accepted by holders of 780,317,294 shares, i.e., 78.79% of its share capital (85.60% if the 78,815,937 treasury shares held by Abertis at that date were disregarded).
154

Good 'til cancelled share purchase order and delisting  Since the threshold of acceptances legally required to be able to exercise
the squeeze-out right vis-à-vis the shareholders that had not accepted the tender offer was not reached, Hochtief triggered the call by Abertis of an EGM for 25 July 2018 which approved the delisting of the shares representing the entire share capital of Abertis from the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges. The delisting from the four Stock Exchanges became effective on 6 August 2018. In accordance with the requirements provided for in the applicable legislation to be able to delist the shares, Hochtief had previously made a good 'til cancelled share purchase order of EUR 18.36 per share for a maximum of 52,612,289 shares of Abertis representing 5.31% of its share capital. This good 'til cancelled share purchase order, which commenced on 21 June 2018, resulted in the acquisition of an additional stake of 3.06% in Abertis once it was completed on 27 July 2018. Therefore, at the date of signing of the consolidated financial statements for 2018 approximately 1.3% of the shares of Abertis were in the hands of other non-controlling shareholders.
Retirement of treasury shares of Abertis  Also, the Board of Directors meeting of Abertis held on 25 September
2018, exercising the powers granted to it by the EGM held on 25 July 2018, resolved to reduce the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. by EUR 236,448 thousand through the retirement of 78,815,937 treasury shares of EUR 3 par value each, representing 7.9581% of its share capital. The objective of the capital reduction was to retire the treasury shares held by Abertis.
155

Incorporation of Abertis HoldCo, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. and transfer of the shares of Abertis to the latter
 Lastly, Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief, pursuant to the resolutions adopted described above, contributed the shares of Abertis acquired as a result of the Hochtief tender offer to a jointly owned holding company with the following structure:
1.- Atlantia, ACS and Hochtief incorporated a Spanish company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., in which Atlantia has an ownership interest of 50% plus one share, ACS has an ownership interest of 30% and Hochtief has an ownership interest of 20% minus one share. Equity of EUR 6,758.8 million was contributed to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., and at the date of authorisation for issue of the consolidated financial statement for 2018 it had borrowings from the financing banks for a nominal amount of EUR 9,823.9 million.
2.- In turn, that company, Abertis HoldCo, S.A., incorporated, as its sole shareholder, Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., to which it contributed equity of EUR 16,519.6 million.
3.- Hochtief sold to Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., for cash, its entire ownership interest in Abertis, representing 98.7% of its share capital, for the same price as it had paid in its acquisition, i.e., EUR 18.36 per share. This sale was completed on 29 October 2018, the date on which control of Abertis was therefore transferred to Abertis HoldCo, S.A., which is in turn controlled by Atlantia.
Merger of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U.
On 10 December 2018, the Boards of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. formally drew up the Common Merger Project for absorption between Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (as Absorbed Society) and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (as Absorbent Society). The aforementioned merger project was approved by both the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. as by the Sole Shareholder of Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. dated 8 February 2019, it has been presented to the public on 14 March 2019 and registered in the Mercantile Registry of Madrid on 15 March 2019, having accounting effects since 1 January 2019.
156

ii) Treasury shares

Pursuant to the authorisations granted by the Annual General Meeting of 25 July 2018, in which, among other resolutions, the Board of Directors of Abertis was authorised to acquire by transfer of title, directly or indirectly through other companies, treasury shares of the Company at a maximum price of EUR 18.36 per share for a maximum period of 5 years, i.e. until 25 July 2023, in 2019 Abertis performed various share purchases.

As a result of the transactions carried out, the treasury shares held at 31 December 2019 represented 0.08% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (0.001% at 2018 year-end).

Also, pursuant to the authorisations granted by the shareholders, in 2018 Abertis retired all the treasury shares that it had held at 2017 year-end (which represented 7.96% of the share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.), with the concomitant capital reduction, and made several subsequent acquisitions.

In any case, the use of the treasury shares held at year-end will depend on such resolutions as might be adopted by the Group's governing bodies.

The changes in the treasury share portfolio in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

At 1 January 2019 Acquisition At 31 December 2019

b) Reserves As a result of the merger in 2019 between Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., as detailed in Notes 1 and 6, on 1 January 2019 the impact of the revaluation described in those notes was recognised as a result of the gain of control of Abertis on 29 October 2018, together with the associated impacts from that date until 31 December 2018 and the transfer of the revaluation reserves existing in the Group at the date of acquisition to "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" (EUR 424.106 thousand, of which EUR 106,077 thousand relate to "Valuation Adjustments Relating to Hedges" and EUR 318,029 thousand to "Translation Differences").
i) Valuation adjustments relating to hedges These relate to the reserve generated by the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated and classified as cash flow hedges and/or hedges of net investments in foreign operations in the case of the fully consolidated companies.
ii) Available-for-sale investments Since 1 January 2018, as part of the application of IFRS 9, these reserves were transferred to investment revaluation reserves under "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" since they will not be transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss and relate mainly to the change in the fair value of various financial investments held by the A4 subgroup.
158

iii) Translation differences
The detail of "Translation Differences" at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

(1) Relating mainly to the translation differences of Autopista Central (EUR -129,933 thousand in 2019 and EUR -59,306 thousand in 2018).
(2) Associated mainly with Gco and Ausol (Argentine peso, EUR -4,427 thousand at 31 December 2019 and EUR 17,213 thousand at December 2018) and, additionally in 2018, the Hispasat subgroup (Brazilian real and US dollar, EUR -31,288 thousand in December 2018).

The changes in translation differences in 2019, without considering the impact associated with the merger of Abertis detailed previously, are due (as in 2018), on the one hand, to the depreciation at the reporting date of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, and the appreciation of the US dollar and, on the other hand, to the application of the criteria established in IAS 29 to the Argentine consolidated companies Gco and Ausol as described in Note 2-g.

(1) Relating to the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation, as detailed in Note 15-d, on the one hand, and to the acquisition of non-controlling interests in Hispasat (EUR 396,064 thousand), A4 (EUR 28,067 thousand) and JEPL (EUR 10,035 thousand).
(2) Including a positive impact of EUR 31,526 thousand resulting from the second payment of the 2017 dividend corresponding to treasury shares held when it was paid.
(3) Including EUR 18,651 thousand (see Note 11) in 2018 relating to "Investment Revaluation Reserve" as detailed in Note 3-d

160

i) Legal reserve of the Parent
Under the Consolidated Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, 10% of net profit for each year must be transferred to the legal reserve until the balance of this reserve reaches at least 20% of the share capital. The legal reserve cannot be distributed to shareholders except in the event of a company's liquidation.
The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below 10% of the increased share capital amount.
Otherwise, until the legal reserve exceeds 20% of share capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose.
At 31 December 2019 (as at 31 December 2018), this reserve had reached the legally required minimum.
ii) Retained earnings (excluding profit for the year) and other reserves
In addition to the effect of recognising the 2019 bonus dividend of EUR 9,963,410 thousand and the distribution of the 2018 dividend of EUR 875,103 thousand paid in the year, as shown in Note 15-e), the most significant changes in this line item in 2019 are as follows:
 The resulting impact of EUR 12,073,773 thousand, as detailed in Notes 1 and 6, of the merger between Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U., effective for accounting purposes on 1 January 2019, which includes the net effect of the purchase price allocation (PPA) to the assets and liabilities of Abertis. In this regard, at the aforesaid date of 1 January 2019, the impact of the aforementioned revaluation was recognised as a result of the gain of control on 29 October 2018, together with the associated impacts from that date until 31 December 2018 and the transfer of the revaluation reserves existing at the Group at the date of acquisition to "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" (EUR -424.106 (see Note 15-b)).
161

 The impact recognised in equity as a result, on the one hand, of the sale of 89.68% of Hispasat and, on the other hand, of the takeover of Trados following the acquisition of an additional 1% of its share capital described in Notes 2-h and in section d) above:

Acquisition of an additional 1% of Trados 45, S.A. (Trados)
Sale of 89.68% of Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat)

 The negative impacts relating to the change in value of cash flow hedges at companies accounted for using the equity method (EUR 19,857 thousand in 2019 compared with EUR 958 thousand in 2018) and EUR -2,916 thousand (net of the related tax effect) due to the change in value of financial assets at fair value through equity (Note 11).
 The positive impact on reserves of EUR 2,913 thousand (2018: EUR 31,526 thousand) of the dividends paid relating to treasury shares at the time of payment.

162

In addition to the effect of the capital reduction through the retirement of treasury shares and the recognition of the dividend paid, the most significant changes in this line item in 2018 were as follows:

 The impact recognised in equity as a result of the transactions carried out with non-controlling interests of the A4 and Hispasat subgroups and of JEPL:

Acquisition of an additional 6.47% of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4)
Acquisition of an additional 26.00% of Jadcherla Expressways Private Ltd. (JEPL)

(*) In connection with the aforementioned effects, if the effect of the initial recognition against reserves of the respective liabilities amounting to EUR 14 million and EUR 302 million, recognised in prior years, is taken into account, the net impact of the aforementioned transactions totals EUR -5 million and EUR +85 million, respectively.

The acquisitions of the non-controlling interests in JEPL and Hispasat were carried out following the fulfilment in the year of the purchase commitments that the Group had to the aforementioned companies' third-party shareholders, the recognition of which in prior years had an accumulated negative impact on reserves of EUR -14,012 thousand and EUR -302,000 thousand, respectively. Therefore, following the recognition in prior years of the purchase commitments relating to shares of JEPL and Hispasat and their subsequent exercise in the first half of 2018, the accumulated impact in the year on the Group's reserves amounted to EUR 8,467 thousand and EUR 387,199 thousand, respectively.
 The positive impact on reserves of EUR 31,526 thousand of the dividend paid relating to treasury shares.

(1) In 2018, in the case of Hispasat, a company/subgroup associated with the satellite telecommunications business that was discontinued in 2017 and whose sale was completed in 2019 (Note 7).
(2) Companies controlled by Abertis as described in Note 2-g.i.

i) Acquisition of an additional 1% of the share capital of Trados.
As indicated in Note 2-h, in 2019 Abertis acquired an additional 1% of the share capital of Trados, as a result of which Abertis became the majority and controlling shareholder of this company, which began to be fully consolidated (until then accounted for using the equity method). Thus, at the date control was obtained a non-controlling interest of EUR 62,854 thousand was recognised.

172

ii) Sale of 89.68% of the share capital of Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat).
As indicated in Note 7, on 3 October 2019 Abertis completed the sale of its entire 89.68% ownership interest in Hispasat, as a result of which the noncontrolling interest held in this subgroup at the date of sale amounting to EUR 106,447 thousand ceased to exist.
Also, "Changes in the Scope of Consolidation and Other" in 2018 related mainly to the impact of the following:
i) Acquisition of an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4.
In 2018 Abertis acquired an additional 6.47% of the share capital of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4), which gave it an ownership interest of 90.03% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the acquisition was reduced by a total amount of EUR 60,832 thousand.
Additionally, since this was an equity transaction carried out with the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that did not modify the controlling position in the A4 subgroup, it gave rise to the recognition of a positive impact of EUR 28,067 thousand on "Retained Earnings and Other Reserves" in the consolidated balance sheet.
ii) Acquisition of an additional 26.00% of the share capital of JEPL.
In 2018 Abertis, following the exercise of the purchase commitment vis-àvis third-party shareholders, acquired an additional 26.00% of the share capital of Jadcherla Expressways Private Ltd. (JEPL), which gave it an ownership interest of 100% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the acquisition totalling EUR 9,794 thousand ceased to exist.
iii) Acquisition of an additional 32.63% of the share capital of Hispasat.
In 2018 Abertis, following the exercise of the purchase commitment vis-àvis third-party shareholders, acquired an additional 32.63% of the share capital of Hispasat, S.A. (Hispasat), which gave it an ownership interest of 89.68% in this company, thereby strengthening its controlling position, as a result of which the non-controlling interest existing at the date of the acquisition was reduced by a total amount of EUR 377,700 thousand.

e) Dividends and dividend proposal

On 19 March 2019, the Annual General Meeting of Abertis approved the payment of a dividend out of profit for the year of EUR 0.96 gross per share of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., representing EUR 875,103 thousand.

It also approved the payment of a bonus dividend out of reserves of EUR 10.93 gross per share of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., representing EUR 9,963,410 thousand. In relation to the aforementioned bonus dividend, Abertis complied with its payment obligation to Abertis HoldCo, S.A. by assuming Abertis HoldCo, S.A.'s contractual position of borrower, as its majority shareholder, in the following financing agreements: i) in the financing agreement totalling EUR 9,950,000 thousand, entered into on 23 October 2018 between Abertis HoldCo, S.A., as borrower, and the original lending entities (carrying amount at the date on which the debt was acquired, amounting to EUR 8,849,533 thousand); and ii) in the financing agreement amounting to EUR 970,000 thousand entered into on 27 December 2018 between Abertis HoldCo, S.A., as borrower, and certain original lending entities (carrying amount at the date on which the debt was acquired, amounting to EUR 967,642 thousand). Following acquisition of the debt by Abertis, the remaining dividend of EUR 146,215 thousand was paid in cash (EUR 17,150 thousand to Abertis HoldCo, S.A.)

Also, on 13 March 2018 the Annual General Meeting of Abertis approved the payment of a dividend out of voluntary reserves of EUR 0.40 gross per share of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., representing EUR 396,152 thousand. Therefore, the total 2017 dividend was EUR 0.80 gross per share, representing EUR 792,305 thousand.

The distribution of dividends is determined on the basis of the separate financial statements of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. and pursuant to the corporate law currently in force in Spain.
The dividends to be distributed to the shareholders are recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements from the time the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (or by the Board of Directors in the case of interim dividends) until they are paid.
At 31 December 2019, no interim dividend had been paid out of the profit for 2019.
If on a dividend distribution date Abertis were to hold shares that did not carry dividend rights, the amount corresponding to those shares would be transferred to voluntary reserves.
In this regard, the directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. will submit for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the following distribution of the 2019 profit of Abertis:

Basis of distribution (Profit)
Distribution: To voluntary reserves

119,663
119,663 119,663

Also, the Board of Directors proposes to pay a 2019 dividend of EUR 875,103 thousand out of unrestricted reserves, representing EUR 0.96 gross per outstanding share carrying dividend rights on the date of payment. This dividend includes the proportional amount that would correspond to the treasury shares currently held.

This Board of Directors resolution will be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Abertis.

The detail of the dividends in 2019 and 2018, without taking into account the extraordinary dividend previously indicated, is as follows:

f) Earnings per share

i) Basic

As shown below, basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of Abertis by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of treasury shares held by the Group and, in the event that a capital increase through a scrip issue were performed, considering its impact as if it had been performed at the beginning of the year, adjusting the impact retrospectively for the years presented.

ii) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share are determined by including in the calculation described above the effect (should there be one) of converting all potentially dilutive shares (share options) into shares of Abertis. In this regard, the conversion is considered to take place at the beginning of the year or, if the potentially dilutive shares were issued during the year, at their issue date.
In 2019 (as in 2018) Abertis did not hold any potentially dilutive shares consisting of share options and, therefore, diluted earnings per share do not differ from basic earnings per share.

Given the Group's cash position indicated in Note 14, in 2019 Abertis increased its net debt from bond issues and bank borrowings (excluding the accounts payable to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and bonds and other financial assets and liabilities) by EUR 9,688,224 thousand to EUR 22,963,284 thousand.

The increase in the year in the Group's net bank borrowings was due mainly to:

 The payment of an extraordinary dividend of EUR 9,963,410 thousand with a charge to the merger reserves resulting from the merger of the Company with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (see Notes 1, 15-a and 15-e). The dividend was paid, primarily, through the assumption of the contractual position of Abertis HoldCo, S.A. as the borrower in various financing agreements amounting to EUR 9,817,195 thousand.
 The payment of dividends in the year (EUR 875,103 thousand relating to the dividend for 2018, from which EUR 282 thousand, corresponding to the dividend associated with treasury shares, must be deducted).
 The impact of the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. and the corresponding inclusion in the consolidated balance sheet since 1 January 2019 of the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group, at 31 December 2019 amounting to EUR 740,953 thousand in the Group's borrowings arising from the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed, as described in the aforementioned Note 6 (at 29 October 2018, date of the gain of control, totalling EUR 1,146,018 thousand).

177

 The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, effective from 1 January 2019, amounting to EUR 66,652 thousand (see Note 5).
 The effect of the investments (in operations and for expansion purposes) made in the year amounting to EUR 670 million.
 The payment of EUR 196,440 thousand by Invin to its non-controlling shareholder (EUR 188,253 thousand at 31 December 2018) in relation to the financing granted to it by the shareholders of the consolidated company.
 The payment of EUR 294,565 thousand for the deferred payment in the purchase in 2014 of 100% of the company Infraestructuras Americanas, S.L.U. (AI, merged since 2017 with Invin, Note 21).
 The payment of EUR 54,863 thousand by Via Paulista to the Transportation Agency of the State of São Paulo (ARTESP) in relation to the fee of BRL 249 million to be paid in 2019, as provided in the concession agreement of the Rodovias dos Calçados highway (Note 21).
 Payment of EUR 87,300 euros relating to the early cancellation of hedging instruments as detailed in Note 12.
 The impact of the gain of control over Trados, which gave rise to the inclusion at the date of acquisition of borrowings of EUR 7,730 thousand (EUR 53,651 thousand at 2019 year-end).
These effects were partially offset, in addition to the cash generated by the Group in its operations, primarily by:
 The sale of 89.68% of Hispasat, which gave rise to a cash inflow of EUR 933,000 thousand.
 The collection of EUR 112,885 thousand for corporate income tax for 2017 (Note 13.iv)
 The exchange rate effect at 31 December 2018, due mainly to the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso at the reporting date, which reduced the Group's net bank borrowings by EUR 30,243 thousand.
Various financing transactions carried out in 2019 provided new funds for the Group, for a net amount of EUR 8,744,949 thousand (2018: EUR 1,279,190 thousand), aimed at allowing it to service part of the debt maturing in 2019 (with debt totalling EUR 9,820,731 thousand being serviced and refinanced (2018: EUR 2,878,551 thousand), increasing its liquidity and optimising its debt maturity profile and borrowing costs, thereby strengthening its financial position. The transactions included most notably the following:

 The arrangement of loans of EUR 50 million and EUR 15 million by A4 Holding and A4 Mobility maturing in January and December 2023, respectively.
 In July 2018 Túnels completed the novation of the financing agreement for EUR 305 million (previously EUR 240 million) in order to extend the term to maturity of the financing to December 2034 and reduce the related borrowing costs. In this connection, the costs associated with this novation amounted to EUR 7 million, and this amount was recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for 2018.
 In January 2018 Rutas del Pacífico repurchased in full the outstanding balance (CLP 139,448 million, approximately EUR 175 million at 2018 year-end) of bonds issued by it in previous years, amounting to CLP 305,376 million (approximately EUR 385 million at 2018 year-end), maturing in December 2024 and with an annual coupon rate of CLF +5.8%.
Also, the Parent took steps to optimise the Group's liquidity and to reduce the finance costs associated with the borrowings by renegotiating in 2018 credit facilities amounting to EUR 1,450 million. Accordingly, the total drawable volume of the credit facilities of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. at the end of 2018 was EUR 2,600 million (all the credit facilities mature at more than one year).

(1) Including at 31 December 2019 EUR 307,789 thousand corresponding to Abertis Infraestructuras Finance B.V., relating in full to bonds (2018 year-end: EUR 221,303 thousand also relating in full to bonds).
Of the total borrowings obtained by the Parent and Abertis Infraestructuras Finance B.V., at 31 December 2019 EUR 38,589 thousand had been lent in turn to other Group companies (2018 year-end: EUR 1,770,571 thousand).
(2) Corresponding substantially in full, both in 2019 and 2018, to the gross payables to third parties of the toll roads business in India.

The main changes in gross bank borrowings in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:
 As stated in Note 6, the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. and the corresponding inclusion in the consolidated balance sheet since 1 January 2019 of the effects of the gain of control of the Abertis Group gave rise to the recognition of an increase of EUR 1,146 million in the Group's borrowings arising from the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed, as described in the aforementioned Note 6. At 31 December 2019, the carrying amount associated with this effect is EUR 940,953 thousan.
 The increase in gross borrowings at Abertis is due mainly to the new issues launched, the new bank loans arranged and the drawdowns against existing facilities and loans described above amounting to EUR 8,182 million.

185

 The change in gross borrowings in Brazil and Chile was affected by the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Brazilian real (impact of EUR -25,472 thousand, offset by the issues launched by Brazilian companies indicated above) and the Chilean peso (impact of EUR 57,116 thousand). On the other hand, in the case of Puerto Rico the change in the Group's gross borrowings was affected by the increase in the year-end exchange rate of the US dollar (impact of EUR 12,315 million, offset by repayments of borrowings in the year).

The weighted average interest rate in 2019 on bond issues and bank borrowings was 3.08% (2018: 3.73%).
The Group's borrowings based on the contractually stipulated cash flows, taking into consideration the related hedges referred to in Note 12, are denominated in the following currencies:

Euro Brazilian real Chilean peso US dollar Pound sterling Japanese yen Indian rupee
Bond issues and bank borrowings

2019 (*) 20,703,982 1,635,111 1,304,353 929,904 467,180 153,610 62,902

(*) The amounts of borrowings shown in the foregoing table relate to the cash flows provided for in the related agreements (taking into consideration the related hedge), which differ from the carrying amount of the borrowings due to the effect of applying IFRS 9 in relation to the borrowings arranged, and to the impact of the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed following the gain of control of Abertis by Atlantia described above.

As indicated in Note 12, a portion of the borrowings in US dollars and all the borrowings in pounds sterling and Japanese yen are converted to euros through derivative financial instruments.

The detail of the bank borrowings by maturity based on the amounts payable to maturity at each reporting date, as provided for in the respective contracts, is as follows:

(*) The amounts of borrowings shown in the foregoing table relate to the cash flows provided for in the related agreements (taking into consideration the related hedge), which differ from the carrying amount of the borrowings due to the effect of applying IFRS 9 in relation to the borrowings arranged, and to the impact of the purchase price allocation (PPA) performed following the gain of control of Abertis by Atlantia described above.

Of the EUR 25,257,046 thousand, EUR 10,422,754 thousand (41%) relate to debt of subsidiaries without recourse to Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (2018: EUR 16,396,738 thousand (62%). The reduction of the debt of subsidiaries without recourse to Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. from 62% to 41% in 2019 is due to the effect of the increase in the level of borrowings of Abertis Infraestructuras described above.

At 31 December 2019, the average term to maturity of the debt was 5.6 years (2018 year-end: 5.0 years).

Also, interest on the aforementioned loans and bonds accrues and is settled on the basis of the specific terms and conditions and maturities. In 2020 interest on the borrowings based on the debt at 31 December 2019 is expected to amount to approximately EUR 740 million (EUR 617 million estimated at 2018 year-end for 2019).

At 31 December 2019, 75% (2018: 82%) of the borrowings bore a fixed interest rate or a rate fixed through hedges. Therefore, possible interest rate fluctuations are not expected to have a significant impact on these consolidated financial statements.

The estimated sensitivity of the consolidated statement of profit or loss to a 50 bp change in the interest rates applied to the floating-rate debt is as follows:

In addition, it should be noted in relation to the sensitivity of derivative transactions to interest rate fluctuations that, in terms of the derivative transactions analysed at 31 December 2019 taken as a whole, with a 50 bp change in the EUR, USD, GBP, YEN, CLP and BRL interest rate curves, and other variables staying constant, the fair value of the derivative transactions taken as a whole would have changed by EUR 88 million (2018: EUR 165 million), with a net impact of EUR 66 million on equity and virtually no impact on profit after tax (2018: impact of EUR 124 million on equity and again virtually no impact on profit after tax).

188

The carrying amount of the current bank borrowings approximates their fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate borrowings is calculated by discounting the payment flows of each debt by the interest rate curve of the currency to which they are tied, and in the case of bonds, the issuer's credit curve is added, which is estimated on the basis of the market prices of the liquid obligations observed for the same issuer in its reference markets.

In this regard, at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the clauses or obligations included in the bond issues had been fulfilled. Additionally, part of these issues subscribed by the Parent Company, amounting to EUR 5,870 million, include clauses related to the change of control, which must be produced together with a negative material impact on the credit rating (loss of the investment grade category). In this regard, as of the date of preparation of these consolidated annual accounts there has been no impact in relation to them.
Additionally, within the framework of the Promissory Note Program (ECP) registered with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in Dublin on 28 June, 2019 amounting to 1,000 million euros, Abertis has carried out issues of promissory notes amounting to 150 million euros, which had been settled at the balance sheet date.
Lastly, it should be noted that since 20 April 2017 Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. has had a promissory note issue programme registered, which amounted to EUR 500 million, against which no amount had been drawn down at 2018 year-end . Also, at 2018 year-end Régis Bittencourt had a BRL 600 million promissory note (approximately EUR 135 million at 2018 year-end), maturing in June 2020 with a spread of 107% of the CDI. This promissory note was repaid in 2019.

iii) Other bank borrowings As at 2018 year-end, at 2019 year-end the other non-current bank borrowings related to the account payable for the acquisition in 2016 of 51.4% of A4 Holding, S.p.A. (A4) for EUR 594 million, of which EUR 589 million will be paid in February 2023 (present value of EUR 527 million at 31 December 2019 and EUR 509 million at 31 December 2018). It should be noted in this regard that the seller factored the receivables from Abertis to a syndicate of banks (with Abertis as a party to the arrangement) and, accordingly, in 2016 those banks became creditors of the Group.
iv) Corporate rating At the date of formal preparation of these consolidated financial statements Abertis had a long-term "BBB" investment-grade adequate credit quality rating awarded by the international credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Ltd. In this regard, Abertis went from a longterm rating of "BBB" to one of "BBB-", owing to the impact of the methodological adaptation of its shareholder Atlantia on the Company. The short-term credit rating at that date was "A-3", which was also revised during the year from "A-2". In addition, in the latest report, dated October 2019, the international credit rating agency Fitch Ratings Ltd. maintained Abertis' long-term "BBB" credit rating and awarded it a short-term "F3" credit rating.

17. DEFERRED INCOME

The changes in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

At 1 January Changes in the scope of consolidation and
business combinations (1) Additions Disposals Transfers Translation differences
At 31 December

2019 32,483
19,880 132
(7,036) 5,107

2018 28,495
11,215 (4,032) (1,492) (1,703) 32,483

(1) Corresponding to the impact of the gain of control over Trados, which until 2018 was accounted for using the equity method (see Note 2-h).

At 31 December 2019, "Deferred Income" includes mainly:

 Compensation to Trados from the Autonomous Community Government of Madrid in relation to the excess cost of compulsory purchases included in the decision of the Madrid High Court in which it recognised the right to receive EUR 33 million to restore the economic and financial feasibility of the concession which, accordingly, does not include the related discounting thereof for the restoration in full of the economic and financial feasibility of the concession arrangement. This compensation is being transferred to profit or loss on a straight-line basis until the end of the concession in 2029.
 Collections by Acesa for the right to use fibre-optic conduits, amounting to EUR 946 thousand (2018: EUR 1,452 thousand), which are being transferred to profit or loss on a straight-line basis until the end of the concession in 2021 (duration of the related right).
 Collections received by the Andes toll road (EUR 8,930 thousand in 2019 and EUR 10,063 thousand in 2018), the Sol toll road (EUR 421 thousand in 2019 and EUR 2,241 thousand in 2018) and the Autopista Central toll road (EUR 9,853 thousand in 2019 and EUR 10,307 thousand in 2018) for the maintenance of the work specified under various supplementary agreements to the respective concession arrangements, which are recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis.
 Amounts received by Metropistas for undertaking certain actions to upgrade the toll facilities and to perform other services on behalf of the concession grantor totalling EUR 946 thousand (2018: EUR 1,499 thousand), which are recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis.

196

Also, at 31 December 2018, in addition to the amounts described above excluding Trados, which was consolidated in 2019, "Deferred Income" included compensation to Aumar from the government for work performed in Sagunto (EUR 1,552 thousand in 2018), and this amount was recognised in profit or loss over the term of the concession (until 31 December 2019).

18. PAYABLE TO SUPPLIERS AND OTHER PAYABLES

The detail of "Payable to Suppliers and Other Payables" at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Trade payables Payable to non-current asset suppliers Payables to companies accounted for using the equity
method and related parties Remuneration payable Other payables Payable to suppliers and other payables

2019 476,321 16,506
46,440 105,863
30,098 675,228

2018 416,964 21,509
7,300 97,235 20,061 563,069

The increase in the "Payable to suppliers and other payables" item is mainly due to the impact of new contracts and/or tenders during the year (new Eurotoll contract with Telepass, free-flow projects in Chile...). These impacts have been partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the closing exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso.

Also, for the Group companies with tax residence in Spain, the following information is required by Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010, of 5 July ("Disclosure Requirement"), amended by Final Provision Two of Law 31/2014, of 3 December, amending the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law to improve corporate governance, in accordance with the Resolution of 29 January 2016 of the Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute on disclosures to be included in the notes to financial statements for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 in relation to the average period of payment to suppliers in commercial transactions, published in the Official State Gazette on 4 February 2016:

The payments shown in the foregoing table in relation to payments to suppliers relate to suppliers that because of their nature are trade creditors for the supply of goods and services and, therefore, they are included under "Payable to Suppliers and Other Payables" in the consolidated balance sheet.

19. INCOME TAX
a) Tax-related disclosures
Following the change of shareholders described in Note 15-a to the consolidated financial statements for 2018, since 1 January 2019 Abertis has been filing consolidated tax returns as subsidiary of a new tax group whose parent is Abertis HoldCo, S.A., the subsidiaries of which are the investees that are at least 75%-owned by it and that are resident for tax purposes in Spain (until 31 December 2018 Abertis filed consolidated tax returns as the parent of the aforementioned tax group).
Also, the Group's subsidiaries with tax residence in France and Italy file income tax returns under the consolidated tax regimes applicable in those countries. The other companies included in the scope of consolidation file individual tax returns.
At 31 December 2019, in general the Group companies had open for review by the tax authorities all the taxes applicable to them for which the statute of limitations period had not expired at that date in each of the jurisdictions where they are located.

199

It should be noted in this connection that:
 In July 2018 Abertis received notification of the commencement of tax audits of the consolidated tax group in Spain for 2014 to 2016 in relation to income tax and for June 2014 to December 2016 for VAT. At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements the tax audits were still in progress.
 In Spain, the tax group the parent of which was Abertis received tax assessments for income tax for 2010 to 2013, personal income tax withholdings for 2012 and 2013 and VAT for July 2011 to December 2013. Those assessments were signed on a contested basis and were appealed against; at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements no decision thereon had been handed down.
In this regard, at 2018 year-end Abertis considers that the tax audits under way, the proceedings associated with the tax assessments signed on a contested basis and possible differences in the way current tax legislation is interpreted in relation to the years open for review will not have a significant impact on the equity reflected in these consolidated financial statements.
Lastly, it should be noted that in 2007 the European Commission initiated an investigation procedure against the Kingdom of Spain in relation to State aid relating to Article 12.5 of the former Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law. In this connection, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 (First Decision) on acquisitions within the EU and Decision 2011/282/EU of 12 January 2011 (Second Decision) on foreign shareholding acquisitions, stating that the deduction regulated by Article 12.5 of the Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law constituted unlawful State aid. In addition to the foregoing, the Commission adopted Decision 2015/314/EU of 15 October 2014 (Third Decision) also classifying as State aid the deductions that applied under Article 12.5 of the Consolidated Spanish Income Tax Law in the case of indirect acquisitions (Third Decision). On 1 April 2015, Abertis filed an action for annulment at the General Court of the European Union against the Third Decision of the Commission, a proceeding that was immediately stayed by the Court until judgments had been handed down on the cassation appeals filed by the Commission against two judgments of the General Court on the Decisions of 2009 and 2011 on this issue.
200

Since the cassation appeals against the First and Second Decisions were upheld, in the first quarter of 2017 the General Court of the European Union ordered the end of the stay of all the actions for annulment against the Third Decision and the re-initiation of the proceedings affected, including that brought by Abertis. Therefore, on 24 March 2017 the European Commission lodged a defence with the General Court, following which Abertis lodged the related reply on 30 May 2017. At the end of this proceeding the General Court of the European Union must hand down a judgment analysing the solid legal grounds presented by Abertis against the Third Decision.
In this connection, on 15 November 2018, the General Court dismissed the appeals against the First and Second Decisions of the Commission, upholding that the amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes constituted State aid incompatible with the internal market, although it confirmed the existence of legitimate expectations in the cases of acquisitions prior to 21 December 2007. A cassation appeal was filed against these judgments at the Court of Justice of the European Union, as a result of which the General Court of the European Union once again ordered the stay of the appeals against the Third Decision. The appeal filed by Abertis against the Third Decision is in progress at the same chamber of the General Court of the European Union, and the final outcomes of the appeals against the First and Second Decisions do not prejudge the specific issues of a different nature raised by Abertis in its appeal against the Third Decision.
In any case, the resolution of this matter is not expected to have a negative impact on the Company's equity because either it has returned the corresponding amount plus late-payment interest, or because it had already recognised a deferred tax liability associated with the goodwill deducted to date which has not yet been actually returned to the Spanish tax authorities.
201

b) Income tax expense
The standard income tax rates in the main countries in which Abertis carries on its operations are as follows:

Spain France (1) Italy (2) Brazil Chile

2019 25% 34.4% 27.5% + 3.9% 34% 27.0%

2018 25% 34.4% 24% + 3.9% 34% 27.0%

(1) The French General State Budget Law for 2019 postponed the reduction in the income tax rate envisaged for 2019 and subsequent years. Accordingly, the tax rate for major French companies remained at 34.43% for 2019. Also, the expected rates are 32.00%, 28.41% and 25.83% for 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
(2) The Italian companies are subject to the income tax known as IRES (Imposta sul reddito sulle società) at a rate of 27.5%, and to the IRAP (Imposta regionale sulle attività produttive) at a rate of 3.9%, although the IRAP tax base is broadly equivalent to the gross margin of the company. An amendment to the Italian General State Budget Law approved in December 2019 established an increase in the income tax (IRES -Imposta sul reddito sulle società-) rate from 24% to 27.5% for Italian toll road concession operators for 2019 to 2021.

In this regard, it should be noted that, on the one hand, Law 759/2019 approved on July 24, 2019 has postponed the reduction of the corporate tax rate planned for the year 2019 (thus maintaining 34.43% instead of 32% planned) and, on the other hand, the Law of General Budgets of the French State for 2020 approved on December 19, 2019 has modified the progressive additional reduction for the years 2020 and 2021 for large French companies by placing the rate in the 32% and 28.41%, respectively (the rates foreseen before this regulatory modification were 28.1% and 27.3%, respectively). The expected reduced rate for the year 2022 of 25.8% is maintained.
It should also be noted that an amendment to the Italian General State Budget Law approved in December 2019 established an increase in the IRES rate from 24.00% to 27.50% for Italian toll road concession operators for 2019 to 2021.

202

The reconciliation of the theoretical tax expense to the tax expense recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year is as follows:

Profit before tax

2019 438,633

2018 2,163,449

Theoretical tax rate - 25% in 2018 and 2017 (1) Effect on the tax expense of:

(15,687) 84,001
295,501

(1) The impact of the different tax rates in certain countries, as well as the profit or loss of companies accounted for using the equity method (taxed at source), is reflected in the other line items (mainly in "Other Tax Effects").
(2) Relating in 2019, on the one hand, to France in connection with the non-reduction envisaged for 2019 of the tax rate from 34% to 32% and the amendment of the reduction envisaged in subsequent years (EUR 1,423 thousand) and, on the other, to Italy in connection with the increase in the tax rate from 24% to 27.5% for 2019 to 2021 (EUR 951 thousand) and on the other hand, to Argentina for the no reduction planned for 2019 of the tax rate from 30% to 25% (EUR 2,103 thousand)
Relating in 2018, on the one hand, to Spain in connection with the reduction of the tax rate in the Province of Vizcaya from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (EUR 14,330 thousand) and, on the other, to Argentina due to the reduction of the tax rate from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand).

"Non-Taxable Income for tax purposes" and "Non-Deductible Expenses for tax purposes" in 2019 and 2018 include items that, in accordance with the tax legislation applicable to the respective consolidated companies, are not taxable or deductible, respectively.

In this regard, at 2018 year-end "Non-Taxable Income" includes mainly the tax effect associated with the gain on the sale of Cellnex, and the tax effect associated with the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession contracts until December 2030.

203

The main components of the income tax expense for the year (for the fully consolidated companies) are as follows:

Tax effects recognised in equity

39,069 78,518

11,863 285,788

(1) Relating in 2019, on the one hand, to France in connection with the non-reduction envisaged for 2019 of the tax rate from 34% to 32% and the amendment of the reduction envisaged in subsequent years (EUR 951 thousand) and, on the other, to Italy in connection with the increase in the tax rate from 24% to 27.5% for 2019 to 2021 (EUR 2,103 thousand).
Relating in 2018, on the one hand, to Spain in connection with the reduction of the tax rate in the Province of Vizcaya from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards (EUR 14,330 thousand) and, on the other, to Argentina due to the reduction of the tax rate from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand).

As a result of the non-reduction envisaged in the income tax rate for 2019 from 34% to 32% in France, the Group companies with tax residence in France recognised an increase of EUR 4,439 thousand in the income tax expense accrued in the year. Also, the increase in the tax rate on toll road concession operators in Italy from 24% in 2019 to 27.5% in 2021 gave rise to an increase of EUR 2,201 thousand in the tax expense accrued in the year, mainly as a result of the increase in net deferred tax liabilities that are expected to reverse in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In the case of companies with tax residence in Argentina, the impact of the planned no reduction for 2019 of the tax rate of 30% to 25% in Argentina, has led to a higher tax expense accrued in the year of 2,103 thousand euros per the increase in net deferred tax liabilities.

The change in deferred taxes was due mainly to the effect of the reversal of the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with business combinations detailed below.

The income tax for 2018 included, in addition to the effect of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities associated with business combinations, the impact related to the reduction in the income tax rate from 28% to 26% in 2018 and to 24% from 2019 onwards in the Province of Vizcaya (Spain), for which the Group company with tax residence in this province (Avasa) recognised a reduction of EUR 14,330 thousand in the current income tax expense for the year.

204

Lastly, it should be noted that Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, which came into force on 1 January 2016, established the obligation to reverse those impairment losses on holdings in the share capital or equity of entities that were deductible for income tax purposes in the income tax base in tax periods commencing prior to 1 January 2013. The amount reversed shall be included, at least, in equal parts in the tax base for each of the first five tax periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.
The aforementioned Royal Decree-Law also limited the offset of tax losses to 25% of the tax base prior to offset. This change will not affect the recoverability of deferred tax assets recognised at the Group section c.i) described below.

(1) In 2019, it corresponds to the impact associated with the application of IFRS 16 (see Note 5). In 2018, it corresponded to the impact associated with the application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15
(2) Including in 2019 the impact indicated in section b) above of the non-reduction in the tax rate in France (EUR 1,423 thousand) and the change in the tax rate in Italy from 24.5% to 27.5% (EUR 952 thousand) and the change of tax rate in Argentina for the year 2020 from 25% to 30% (EUR 2,103 thousan). Including in 2018 the effect described above of the change in the tax rate in the Province of Vizcaya (Spain) (EUR 14,330 thousand) and the effect of the change in the tax rate in Argentina from 35% to 30% (EUR 1,357 thousand).
(3) Deferred tax liabilities include an impact of EUR -36,982 thousand associated with the recognition of hyperinflation by Argentine Group companies.

205

The exchange differences arising in the year relate mainly to deferred tax assets and liabilities of companies with tax residence in Brazil (BRL 599,414 thousand and BRL 334,225 thousand, respectively, in 2019, and BRL 556,482 thousand and BRL 429,609 thousand, respectively, in 2018), and to deferred tax assets and liabilities of Chilean companies (CLP 121,223,190 thousand and CLP 1,148,351,398 thousand, respectively, in 2019, and CLP 94,761,214 thousand and CLP 387,303,468 thousand, respectively, in 2018), as a result of the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso at year-end (2018 year-end also depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso). The variations of the 2019 fiscal year due to changes in the consolidation perimeter and business combinations correspond entirely to the takeover of Trados, after the acquisition of an additional 1% of its share capital, after which Abertis has become the majority shareholder and of control, going to consolidate said company by global integration (until then, registered by the participation method). It should also be noted, in relation to the consolidated companies Gco and Ausol, as described in Note 2-g.vi of the consolidated accounts of fiscal year 2018, that as the Argentine economy was considered to be hyperinflationary, it was necessary to adjust the financial statements of these Group companies located in Argentina in order to express them in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. In this connection, the cumulative historical differences between the restated costs and the previous costs of deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2017, amounting to EUR -29,230 thousand, were recognised with a credit to "Translation Differences" and "Non-Controlling Interests" in consolidated equity with effect for accounting purposes from 1 January 2018.

a) Pension obligations
Among the obligations to their employees, various Group companies in Spain sponsor defined contribution employment-based pension plans and/or have defined contribution and/or defined benefit pension obligations, arranged through insurance policies, as provided for in the legislation governing the externalisation of pension obligations.
Abroad, various Group companies have defined contribution and/or defined benefit obligations to their employees. These obligations are instrumented through external entities, except in countries where local legislation allows internal allowances to be set up.
The economic-actuarial information on the existing liability for the various Group companies' pension obligations to their employees is as follows:
i) Defined contribution obligations
EUR 6,591 thousand were recognised as staff costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year in relation to defined contribution obligations (2018: EUR 6,649 thousand) (Note 22-c).
ii) Defined benefit obligations
Except in countries where local legislation allows internal allowances to be set up, pension obligations are instrumented through insurance policies or separate entities, in accordance with the applicable legislation in each country, and are not included in the balance sheet. However, this line item includes the obligations and the related plan assets in cases in which the legal or constructive obligation to provide the benefits agreed upon is retained.
In relation to obligations of this nature, at 31 December 2019 (as at 31 December 2018), Abertis had pension obligations relating to defined benefit plans in the following countries:
 In Spain, Abertis, Aumar, Acesa, Invicat and Aucat have pension obligations arising from retirement bonuses regulated in collective agreements. These obligations are financed externally pursuant to local legislation.
211

 In France, the Hit/Sanef subgroup companies and Emovis and Eurotoll offer retirement bonuses corresponding to a legal obligation (IFC: Indemnité de Fin de Carrière). In addition, Sapn has a healthcare plan for retired former employees.
 In Italy, A4 offers termination indemnities corresponding to a legal obligation (TFR: Trattamento di fine Rapporto). Since 1 July 2007, the benefit rights of employees of companies in the subgroup with more than 50 employees are covered by other external systems (National Social Security Institute (INPS) or a defined contribution pension plan) and, therefore, the TFR plan does not offer additional rights for services beyond this date at those companies. The TFR is not externally financed.

In relation to the aforementioned defined benefit obligations of the various Group companies to their employees, the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the actuarial present value of these obligations is as follows:

2018 100% 100%

At 31 December 2019 (as at 31 December 2018), all the assets related to guaranteed interest rate group insurance policies and profit-sharing.
For obligations financed through insurance contracts, the entity is not exposed to unusual market risks and it does not need to apply asset-liability matching strategies or longevity swaps. For the other obligations, the Group does not have any asset-liability matching strategies, as there are no plan assets. Similarly, there are no transferable financial instruments held as plan assets or plan assets that are property occupied by the entity.
The Group does not have any responsibilities for the governance of the plans, apart from participating in the negotiation of collective agreements that determine the benefits to be paid and in the settlement of the required contributions.

214

The actuarial assumptions (demographic and financial) used are the best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits.
The main actuarial assumptions used at the reporting date are as follows:

Discount rate (based on type of obligation and currency) Percentage salary increase (based on type of obligation and
currency) Pension obligations in Spain:

RG48 INPS

The discount rate used was determined on the basis of the "iboxx AA" corporate bond rate curve at 31 December 2019, based on the duration of the obligations (as in 2018).
It should also be noted that for the main defined benefit plans the estimated sensitivity of the obligation recorded at year-end to a 50 bp change (in the variables shown below) would be:

Discount rate Percentage salary increase

2019 5.0% - 4.7% 3.7% - 4.0%

2018 4.9% - 4.6% 3.4% - 3.6%

There were no changes in the methods and assumptions used for the sensitivity analysis with respect to the preceding year. The method used to perform the sensitivity analysis was the projected unit credit method, changing each assumption while keeping the others constant.
No contributions are expected to be made in 2020.
Lastly, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 2019 year-end is 9.6 years (2018 year-end: 10.6 years).

215

b) Other obligations
Together with the aforementioned obligations, several Group companies have long-term obligations to their employees in the form of incentives to attain the business targets established in the 2019-2021 Plan, length of service bonuses and vacation pay, also regulated in the collective agreements, after a given number of years of uninterrupted service and other requirements have been achieved. With regard to the measurement of these obligations, a liability totalling EUR 13,994 thousand (2018: EUR 15,455 thousand) is included under this heading in the consolidated balance sheet, and the noncurrent liability recognised in this connection amounts to EUR 11,807 thousand (2018: EUR 13,250 thousand).
The change in these obligations includes mainly, on the one hand, the provision for the corresponding portion of the obligation associated with the "2019-2021 Incentive Plan" and, on the other, the settlement in the year of the "2018-2020 Incentive Plan" as it had been superseded by the "2019-2021 Incentive Plan" (Note 26-a).
The staff costs recognised in 2019 in relation to these obligations amounted to EUR 8,103 thousand (2018: EUR 7,790 thousand) (Note 22-c).

The exchange differences that arose in 2019 were due mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso (2018: due mainly to the decrease in the year-end exchange rate of those currencies plus the US dollar).
Also, the other provisions used include those charged to profit or loss as a result of the impact associated with the expiry of the Aumar concession arrangement at 31 December 2019.

a) Provisions required under IFRIC 12
"Provisions Required under IFRIC 12" relates to the provision associated with future work, essentially road surfaces (in concessions accounted for using the intangible asset or bifurcated model), that the Group's concession operators are required to carry out as a result of the use of the infrastructure in order to maintain and restore it.

218

These provisions are recognised on the basis of the best estimate of future disbursements required to carry out the next cycle of work on the infrastructure, with the provisions being systematically recognised during each cycle with a charge to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on the basis of the usage of the infrastructure (with an average duration at each of the concessions of between seven and ten years) until the work is actually carried out. These future disbursements are estimated on the basis of technical studies, the quantification of which is subject, inter alia, to the condition of the infrastructure when the work is performed and to fluctuations in construction service price indexes. Consequently, the annual cash outflows associated with these provisions vary according to the duration of each work cycle, and it is estimated that provisions of approximately EUR 309 million.
b) Other provisions
The other long-term provisions at 31 December 2019 (as at 31 December 2018) include mainly:
 Provisions, estimated in the same manner as the provision described above, for replacement or substitution as a result of the expiry of the various concessions. Consequently, the cash outflows arising in this connection are tied to the work to be carried out at the end of each of the Group's concessions and, therefore, such outflows are not expected to be significant in the coming years.
 The provision in relation to the possible liabilities associated with the obligations acquired vis-à-vis the creditors of Alazor (see Note 10.i), the balance of which at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 228 million following the refund in 2017 of the amounts executed in 2016 (31 December 2018: also EUR 228 million). In connection with this provision, the amount and timing of the disbursement ultimately made will depend on the outcome of any processes that may arise as a result of the guarantees given.

"Non-Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" at 31 December 2019 includes mainly:
 The revised value of the contributions that the toll road concession operators in the Hit/Sanef subgroup must make to the French Government pursuant to the agreements entered into within the framework of "Plan Relance" for French toll roads (EUR 117 million at 31 December 2019 and EUR 112 million at 31 December 2018).
 The amount payable by Aulesa to the Spanish Government (EUR 44 million at both 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018) by virtue of the participating loans granted by it.
 The amount payable by Túnels to the Catalonia Autonomous Community Government, the present value of which at 31 December 2019 was EUR 62 million (31 December 2018: EUR 53 million) in relation, on the one hand, to the fee of EUR 120 million payable at the end of the concession term (December 2037) and, on the other, the additional fee (also payable in 2037) recognised in 2013 and 2014 as a result, as established in the concession arrangement, of net toll revenue in said years exceeding the projections in the Economic and Financial Plan.
 Pursuant to IFRS 16, since 1 January 2019 the present value of the fixed payments to be made at more than 12 months under finance leases in force (discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease) amounting to EUR 66,970 thousand.

It should also be noted that at 31 December 2018 "Non-Current Liabilities Other Liabilities" included the amount pending payment by Invin to its minority partner (EUR 188 million) in relation to the financing that the shareholders of the consolidated company had granted it, which has been canceled after the payment of EUR 196,440 thousand in this year 2019.

220

In addition, at 31 December 2019 "Current Liabilities - Other Liabilities" included mainly:
 The balances of Gco and Ausol relating to the work to be performed in future years using the funds obtained from third parties -RAE- pursuant to the concession arrangement described in Note 27-c) (see Note 13.v).
 The balance payable to the Government by the subsidiary Acesa as a result of the obligation acquired under the merger agreement with the previous operator of the concession for the Montmeló-El Papiol stretch of the related toll road (EUR 20,973 thousand at both 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018).
 Pursuant to IFRS 16, since 1 January 2019 the amount of the fixed payments to be made in the next 12 months under finance leases in force amounting to EUR 20,881 thousand.
On the other hand, at the end of December 31, 2018, the item "Other liabilities - Current" in addition to the aforementioned included the following liabilities:
 A liability for the acquisition in 2014 of all the shares of Infraestructuras Americanas, S.L.U. (IA, merged with Invin since 2017) for EUR 295 million payable in August 2019 (EUR 290 million at 31 December 2018).
 The amount payable by Via Paulista to Agencia de Transporte do Estado de São Paulo (ARTESP), the value of which at 31 December 2018 was EUR 56 million, in relation to the fee of BRL 249 million payable in 2019, in accordance with the concession arrangement of the Rodovias dos Calçados toll road granted in 2017.
 The investment obligation of Sol, recognised at its present value (EUR 150 million) for the performance of construction work, as described in Note 9, which in 2019 was transferred to "Current Liabilities- Provisions Required under IFRIC 12" (see Note 20.ii).
221

22. INCOME AND EXPENSES

a) Services

The breakdown of "Services" by category is as follows:

Toll road revenue (1) Toll reductions and volume rebates Other services Services

2019 5,133,316 (64,782) 153,219
5,221,753

2018 4,925,989 (38,504) 162,261
5,049,746

(1) Including, in the case of the Chilean companies, the toll road revenue net of the period provision for doubtful debts relating to the amount of toll revenue that foreseeably will not be collected (CLP -28,698,394 thousand in 2019 compared with CLP -21,655,697 thousand in 2018 corresponding mainly to Autopista Central in Chile, equal to EUR -36,446 thousand and EUR -28,557 thousand, respectively).

The toll road revenue in 2019 was boosted mainly by the increase in traffic in the various countries in which the Group operates, as well as the toll increases at the various concessions and the effects of the new scope of consolidation (basically the inclusion of Trados and the Via Paulista operation for the whole year). However, all of this was partially offset by the negative exchange differences that arose in the year as a result of the depreciation of the average exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso at 31 December 2019.

b) Other operating income and other income
"Other Operating Income" includes income from the assignment of the operation of the service areas and the telematic services of certain toll road concession operators, indemnity payment collections, etc.
Substantially all of the "Other Income" at 31 December 2018 related to the net impact of the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession arrangements until December 2030.

222

c) Staff costs
The detail of "Staff Costs" is as follows:
Wages and salaries Social security contributions Pension costs:
Defined contribution plans (Note 20.i.a.i) Defined benefit plans (Note 20.i.a.ii) Cost of other long-term obligations (Note 20.i.b) Other employee welfare expenses Staff costs

2019 365,657 112,398
6,591 3,770 8,103 66,199 562,718

2018 374,134 119,859
6,649 3,723 7,790 69,559 581,714

The decrease in "Staff Costs" was due mainly to the average number of employees, as well as due to the exchange losses incurred in the reporting period as a result of the depreciation of the average exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso at 31 December 2019.

The average number of employees at Abertis and its subsidiaries in 2019 and 2018, by category and gender, is as follows:

223

In addition, the final number of employees at Abertis and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2019 and 2018, by category and gender, is as follows:

Note: The final number of Abertis employees at 31 December 2018 included 188 employees associated with noncurrent assets classified as held for sale and, therefore, the number of employees at year-end excluding those associated with those assets and/or businesses was 14,119 in 2018.

Also, it should be noted that the shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 10 December 2018 set the number of members of the Board of Directors of Abertis at five. At 31 December 2019 (as at 2018 year-end), the aforementioned Board of Directors had five members (all males), with all the seats on the Board occupied.

d) Other operating expenses

The detail of the main items of "Other Operating Expenses" in 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Upkeep activities and other operating expenses Local taxes other than income tax Rent and royalties Other expenses Other operating expenses

2019 588,603 287,137 84,291 178,296
1,138,327

2018 614,635 280,230 96,945 189,370
1,181,180

The decrease in the other operating expenses was due mainly to the efficiency plans implemented by the Group, as well as due to the exchange losses incurred in the reporting period as a result of the depreciation of the average exchange rate experienced by the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso at 31 December 2019.

(2) In 2019, the total interest on loans with credit institutions and others includes, on the one hand EUR 280,931 thousand lower financial expense after the revaluation of the financial debt due to the merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones (Note 6) and, on the other hand, EUR 103,179 thousand of higher financial expenses associated with the assumption of the debt of HoldCo, S.A. (Note 16).
(3) Loss on the net monetary position of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, which operate in a hyperinflationary economy, derived, in accordance with IAS 29, as the difference resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets, owners' equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income and the adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities.

Also, it should be noted that the net financial loss for 2018 included a nontaxable positive gross impact, net of the costs associated with the transactions, of EUR 604,877 thousand associated with the sale in 2018 of 34.0% of the share capital of Cellnex, recognised under "Net Gains (Losses) on Disposals of Financial Instruments" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

226

23. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS
i) Contingencies
The detail of the Group's guarantees to third parties provided by banks, which are not expected to give rise to significant costs, is as follows:

31 December 2019

31 December 2018

For operating obligations and commitments For other obligations and commitments (1)

287,899 279,923 567,822

337,151 258,174 595,325

(1) Basically for obligations and commitments associated with investments and financing, etc.

The decrease in the year was due mainly to the decrease at Vias Chile in guarantees provided to third parties in relation to certain credit memos and to the depreciation of the Chilean peso (CLP 10,566 thousand, approximately EUR 20 million at 2019 year-end) and, therefore, to the reduction in the guarantees of Serenissima Partecipazioni as a result of the settlement of guarantee claims (EUR 20 million).

As at 2018 year-end, the subsidiary Aumar has undertaken to provide guarantees for its investee Ciralsa amounting to EUR 4,987 thousand; a provision was recognised in this connection in 2015. Also, Abertis has undertaken to provide guarantees for its subsidiary Aulesa amounting to EUR 28 million in relation to a financing agreement entered into by the latter (2019: EUR 29 million).

In addition, until they were cancelled (see Note 12), Abertis was guaranteeing the settlements of two derivatives arranged by Abertis India, the positive fair value of which at 31 December 2018 was EUR 9,736 thousand.

Also, Abertis acts as guarantor in relation to the operating agreements entered into by Emovis for EUR 48,943 thousand (2018: EUR 46,922 thousand) and by Eurotoll for EUR 5,660 thousand (2018: EUR 5,034 thousand).

227

In addition, the financing agreements of the associate Alazor include the commitment of its shareholders to make additional contributions in the event that certain events relating to the achievement of financial ratios should occur and in order to service debts and cover certain additional costs for which financing is not available. Provisions were recognised in prior years for the best estimate of all the possible liabilities associated with these commitments assumed and guarantees provided (Note 10.i).
Lastly, it should be noted that at 31 December 2019 the concession operators in the Arteris subgroup that were granted concessions by the Brazilian Government have in progress with the grantor certain notices and/or other negotiations, relating primarily to these companies' normal liability within the framework of the bidding for, and performance and termination of, their concession arrangements, for a total combined amount of BRL 1,353 million (2018 year-end: BRL 981 million, equal, at the end of the respective periods, to approximately EUR 307 million and EUR 221 million), as well as various other legal proceedings, the unfavourable resolution of which to the interests of the Group is deemed possible, totalling BRL 63 million (2018 year-end: BRL 57 million, equal to approximately EUR 14 million and EUR 13 million at the end of the respective reporting periods), and it is considered that they will not give rise to other liabilities at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements that might give rise to material cash outflows other than those described in Note 20.
The contingencies detailed in Note 19 in relation to potential tax contingencies that might arise should also be taken into consideration.
ii) Commitments and obligations
In addition to the property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and financial asset model concession investment commitments indicated in Notes 8, 9 and 13, respectively, at 31 December 2019 the Group had the following commitments and obligations:
228

 As part of the agreement with the French Government for "Plan Relance" for French toll roads, the shareholders of the French concession operators resolved to create a fund to develop infrastructure of a clearly environmental nature ("Fonds de Modernisation Ecologique des Transports", FMET). The contribution of Abertis as the sole shareholder of the French subgroup Hit/Sanef is estimated at around EUR 52 million, which will be paid as the various investment projects to be carried out are approved. In the year ended 31 December 2019, contributions of EUR 2,875 thousand were made in this connection (2018: EUR 1,350 thousand), and the accumulated contributions at 2019 year-end amount to EUR 5,600 thousand.
 On 11 October 2019, Abertis entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners (GSIP) to acquire 50.1% of the shares of the Mexican toll road group Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO) for approximately EUR 1,500 million. This agreement is subject to approval by the regulatory authorities and to other terms and conditions commonly governing transactions of this nature. This agreement is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020.
229

24. INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONTMENT It is Group policy to pay maximum attention to environmental protection and conservation activities, and each investee adopts measures to minimise the environmental impact of the infrastructure that it manages in order to ensure the maximum degree of environmental integration of the infrastructure in their respective geographical areas. In 2019 the Group's expenditure on improving the environment amounted to EUR 25,428 thousand (2018: EUR 23,256 thousand), mainly through the following actions:
 Cleaning, landscaping and clearing along the toll roads, as well as upgrades to the service and rest areas and work to reduce visual and acoustic impact.
 Collection and removal of hazardous urban waste.  Aquifer resource protection plans (especially in the framework of the
"Plan Relance" agreement reached with the French government for the modernisation of the toll road network).  Environmental impact studies, mainly in relation to the work to expand the capacity of the toll roads in Brazil. To a lesser extent, implementation of measures to optimise water management and energy consumption and reduce noise pollution
230

25. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group's various activities are organised and managed separately based on the geographical area of the infrastructure managed, with each operating segment (highways by geographical area) constituting a strategic business unit that manages different types of infrastructure in different markets. Consequently, the Group's decision-making bodies base their decision making on information broken down by operating segment.
Management has defined an operating segment as a group of assets and operations used for managing infrastructure subject to risks and rewards that are distinct from those managed by other business segments.
In this regard, the identified motorway segment includes the construction, conservation and operation of motorways under concession; management of highway concessions in Spain and abroad; construction of road infrastructure works and complementary activities to the construction, conservation and operation of highways.
It should be noted that Abertis' management of its highways is organized based on their geographical classification into: Spain highways, France highways, Italy highways, Brazil highways, Chile highways, Puerto Rico highways, Argentine highways and rest of the world highways.
In addition, "Other" mainly includes the activity carried on by the Parent (holding shares of the Group companies and managing those companies) and other companies that provide financing to Group companies.
The operating segments reported on obtain their revenue on the basis of the nature of the service provided, as described in Note 3-o, and their customers are the end users of the toll road infrastructure.
The directors, who constitute the Group's highest operating decision-making authority, analyse the results of each segment, down to the profit or loss from operations, given that this is the item from which operating expense and revenue can be directly attributed to, or reasonably distributed among, the segments.

(1) The loss of the "Other" relates to the 34% ownership interest held in Cellnex until May 2018 and the 29.9% interest held until July 2018.
(2) Including mainly the interest income and expenses on borrowings, which are mostly managed by corporate central services, and the financial impact of the application of IFRIC 12, and at 2018 year-end the gain on the sale of 34.0% of Cellnex totalling EUR 604,877 thousand.

The overall increase in the operating aggregates of the Toll roads operating segment was due mainly to (i) the positive trend in traffic in the principal countries in which the Group operates; (ii) the increase in tolls in the various concessions; and (iii) the impact associated with the gain of control of Trados (in the case of the Spanish toll roads) and the operation for the whole year of ViaPaulista in the case of the Brazilian toll roads.

233

These impacts were partially offset by (i) the impact net of taxes of EUR 78 million recognised in 2018 associated with the recognition of the outstanding measures to restore the economic and financial balance of the Argentine companies Gco and Ausol, following the agreements entered into on 3 July 2018 with the Argentine Ministry of Transport to extend their respective concession arrangements until December 2030 (with an impact on the Toll roads Argentina operating segment); (ii) the expiry in May 2018 of the Via Norte toll road concession (with an impact on the Toll roads Brazil operating segment); and (iii) the impact of the depreciation of the average exchange rate at 31 December 2019 of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso, which adversely affected the aggregates of the Toll roads Brazil, Toll roads Chile and Toll roads Argentina operating segments, respectively. It should be noted that the depreciation and amortisation charge increased significantly (reducing the profit for the year, particularly in the Toll roads Spain, Toll roads France, Toll roads Chile and Toll roads Puerto Rico operating segments) as a result of the increase in the depreciation charge arising from the revaluation of the concession arrangements in the PPA performed following the gain of control of the Group and the subsequent merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (see Note 6). The detail of the assets and liabilities of the segments at 31 December 2019 and 2018 and of the investments in non-current assets made in each year is as follows:

The changes in the balance sheet aggregates were due mainly, on the one hand, to the revaluation of intangible assets (basically concession arrangements) and, on the other, to the revaluation of the bank borrowings (affecting in particular the Toll roads France and Other segments) in the PPA performed following the gain of control of the Group and the subsequent merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A.U. (Note 6). This impact was partially offset by the effect of the depreciation at year-end of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso. Also, it should be noted that there were no significant inter-segment transactions in 2019 or 2018. The segment assets include primarily property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and financial assets arising from the application of the bifurcated model and the financial asset model under IFRIC 12, inventories, accounts receivable, cash from operations and deferred tax assets. The segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and the bank borrowings arranged to carry on operations. The investments in non-current assets comprise additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, as well as financial assets accounted for under IFRIC 12 using the bifurcated and financial asset models.

(3) In relation to the consolidated company Gco, on 8 November 2018, the Group, in accordance with the requirements established by the National Securities Commission of Argentina formalized a trust in 5.73% of the investment held in the same, establishing in the agreement, among other aspects, the transfer to the fiduciary of the political and economic rights associated with the participation subject to assignment.In this context, on 27 November 2018, after receiving the necessary authorization from the National Road Administration ("DNV") of Argentina, Acesa, a subsidiary of the Group, sold 9,160,136 of its Class A shares, representative of 5.73% of economic rights and 7.58% of political rights, to TMF Trust Company (Argentina), SA ("TMF"). From a legal point of view, the voting and economic rights corresponding to the shares were irrevocably transmitted to TMF and, therefore, Acesa reduced its voting rights in Gco from 57.7% that it held to 49.99 %. TMF is an independent, international fiduciary and member of the TMF Group who, in that capacity, was commissioned to transmit the aforementioned Gco shares to one or more possible interested third parties. For its part, from an accounting point of view and in accordance with the regulatory framework of financial information applicable to the Group, on the one hand, the situation of prior control was reassessed, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 10, concluding that the Group He continued to maintain de facto control and, on the other hand, in accordance with the terms of the agreement with TMF, the accounting withdrawal was not considered because of retaining economic risks linked to the sale price of the shares. In relation to the aforementioned operations, as of 31 December 2019, TMF kept the process of searching for a buyer of the shares in Gco open at a price that reflects the valuation made by its independent financial advisor.

Letter to the Shareholders and Stakeholders
Abertis is one of the world's leading operators in toll road management, with 8,500 kilometres of high-capacity roads and electronic toll management systems, with presence in 15 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of its more than 13,000 employees, the Group has a solid foundation to face the future with rigour and confidence. Its experience and financial strength, together with the excellence of its industrial model, and its long-term vision, make the company in a central player in the search for solutions to one of the greatest global challenges: the sustainable management of various infrastructures of the future. In 2019 Abertis reached a new milestone in its history, with the signing of an agreement to purchase the concession group Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO), one of the largest toll road operators in Mexico. The Group, together with the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, sealed an agreement for the acquisition of the 70% ownership interest that Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners holds in RCO. The transaction will be carried out through a consortium, whereby Abertis will acquire 50.12% of RCO for close to EUR 1,500 million. RCO wholly owns 5 concession operators that manage 8 toll roads stretching over a total of 876 kilometres. RCO's toll road network is one of the most important in Mexico and forms the backbone of the communication routes in the central-western region of the country, connecting the country's main industrial corridor (El Bajío) and its two largest cities (Mexico City and Guadalajara). This acquisition represents an important growth transaction for the Abertis Group, whereby it obtains a foothold in a country that offers a commitment to public-private partnership. It also consolidates Abertis's presence as a toll road operator in the Americas, where it already has a strong presence in Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Puerto Rico. Abertis thus adds nearly 900 kilometres to its network and contributes to the extension of the average life of its concession portfolio. With the obtainment of control of RCO, Abertis demonstrates its ability to replace the future loss of revenue arising from the expiry of concessions with other assets with solid future prospects and a long concessional life. The Group will establish a new growth platform in Mexico, a target market that the Company has actively explored in recent years, and which will facilitate the analysis of future opportunities. This transaction represents a further step forward in Abertis's international growth strategy. Growth transactions such as RCO, together with divestments, such as the executed at Hispasat in 2019, the efficient debt management - in 2019, Abertis has made issues for more than EUR 6.000 million, making it the leading Spanish issuer during the year - and a new efficiency plan of nearly EUR 150 million in annual savings constitutes the Action Plan planned by the company's shareholders. As part of this plan, the Abertis Group will continue to analyse future opportunities that arise in the medium and long term.
Main Aggregates
In 2019, traffic on the Group's toll road network continued to rise in most countries, with average daily traffic (ADT) 1.9% higher than in 2018. The increase in Spain (+4.3%), France (+1.0%) and Brazil (+4.1%) is particularly noteworthy.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 4
The increase in traffic and tolls enabled Abertis to improve its aggregates for 2019. Revenue has increased to EUR 5,361 million, while EBITDA reached EUR 3,737 million (+5% in comparable terms with respect 2018). The consolidated net profit for the year was EUR 352 million, after the process of allocating the purchase price of the merger between Abertis and Abertis Participaciones (without considering this effect, the result would have been EUR 1,101 million) In addition, the Group's total investment in 2019 amounted to 670 million euros, the vast majority of which corresponded to investment to improve the network.
Furthermore, as the world's leading toll road operator, road safety is a priority for Abertis. In this regard, in 2019 the Group reduced the mortality rate on its toll roads (-10%) and the number of deaths in road accidents (-7.5%). All of this is the result of extensive efforts in prevention and safety improvement carried out in all countries.
Sustainable Management
The 2019 management report incorporates information on the organisation's performance in economic, environmental, social and good governance terms, and consists of a management report with two annexes that go into greater detail on information related to non-financial performance and corporate governance.
Abertis has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2005, and through this communication it hereby formalises the renewal of its commitment with the Principles of the Global Compact and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Note the special contribution of our company to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in which the strategic programmes of Road Tech and Road Safety have a high potential for impact.
The group's materiality analysis was updated in 2019, which made it possible to formally identify the material aspects for Abertis Mobility Services, and those of the countries not included in the first analysis have been revised. As a result, adjustments will have to be assessed, both in the management and information gathering systems, in order to incorporate the new material aspects identified, in addition to continuing work to directly involve stakeholders during the next financial year.
The Appendix on Follow-up of the CSR Master Plan provides detail on the performance indicators and the degree of compliance with the targets established in the Plan for each of the strategic objectives. The reduction reflected in the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents, the number of occupational accidents among direct employees and the greenhouse gas emissions are some of the positive developments in the excersise. We will continue to work towards achieving the targets relating to supplier assessment and approval, circular economy and social commitment to local communities, while at the same time evaluating the CSR Master Plan and updating the strategy for managing material environmental, social and good governance aspects in the medium term

3.2 Strategic approach
The current Strategic Plan, together with the Road Tech and Road Safety strategic programmes and the CSR Master Plan, constitute the main elements of the Abertis Group's strategic approach.
Following the successful completion of the previous Strategic Plan, the Group is executing the plan for 2019-21, which is aimed at creating value on the basis of the following pillars: (i) financial flexibility, (ii) efficiencies and (iii) growth.

i) Financial flexibility
Based on the line of action in recent years, which has consisted of focusing on the toll roads business, in October 2019 the Group sold its 89,68% ownership interest in Hispasat to Red Eléctrica Corporación for EUR 933 million.
Following this sale, and having disposed of the ownership interest in Cellnex in 2018, Abertis completed the process of focusing on the toll roads business.

2 Abertis Mobility Services has 744 employees

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 11
Abertis' strategy is to optimize its investment portfolio. To do this, the Company seeks to obtain control of all its investees, and dispose of its investments in the investees over which it cannot gain control, in order to fully consolidate all its ownership interests. Along these lines, in the current year, Abertis acquired an additional 1% of the share capital of the Spanish company Trados45, S.A. for EUR 4.8 million, thus obtaining a 51% interest therein. This acquisition enables Abertis to fully consolidate that company.
ii) Efficiencies
Having completed the efficiencies plan for the 2015-17 period with cumulative savings of EUR 416 million, the Group approved the third efficiencies plan definied until 2021, which is estimated to give rise to savings of EUR 510 million, concentrated mainly in the businesses in France, Brazil, Italy and Spain. This plan seeks to maximize synergies and obtain value added through the contributions of all the shareholders in the technology, operations and engineering areas; focused on improving EBITDA through optimization of operating and personnel costs and revenues.
iii) Growth
The growth of Abertis is driven by two lines of action: · Growth on the basis of existing assets (organic) · New growth (inorganic)
In relation to organic growth, the aim is for Abertis to consolidate itself as the benchmark operator in the countries in which it is present, by achieving new projects, creating value and negotiating compensation through toll increases and/or concession term extensions. In relation to inorganic growth, the aim is to harness the synergies arising from market presence and the areas of responsibility of Atlantia and ACS/Hochtief. Also, Abertis is open to exploring greenfield projects, provided that they are in financially stable countries with a robust legal framework. Lastly, studies will be performed on whether the Group should gain a foothold in countries with high growth potential, in regions such as South and Central America. In October 2019 Abertis entered into an agreement to acquire 50.12% of the Mexican group Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO) for approximately EUR 1,500 million. This agreement is subject to various authorizations which are expected to be obtained in the first half of 2020. RCO is one of the main operators in Mexico, managing 877 km through five concessions, which expire between 2025 and 2048. On completion of the transaction, Abertis will be present in 16 countries, substantially increasing the average concession term and offsetting almost in full the loss of EBITDA from the upcoming end of the ACESA concession in 2021.

Safe and innovative toll roads (R&D)
As one of the world's leading toll road operators, Abertis manages its infrastructure under four basic principles that interact with each other and make up its industrial model: road safety, the pursuit of intelligent solutions to boost efficiency and travelling comfort, innovation and the harnessing of the benefits provided by new technologies and a focus on the customer. 52.4% of toll road revenue has a road safety management system in place, and 38.7% is certified under the ISO 39001 international standard. In addition, the toll roads in Chile have implemented and certified an emergency management and incident response system in accordance with the ISO 22350 international standard.
6.1 Road Safety
Abertis makes road safety its top priority, which it works towards through the global "Road Safety" programme. Through this programme, transversal teams from all disciplines and geographical areas work together at the Group to guarantee knowledge and application of the best practices in road safety on Abertis's toll roads. Abertis's Road Safety programme encompasses more than 60 years of knowledge and experience in the construction and management of toll roads, complying with the highest international quality standards. Thus, the Group follows the most widely recognized policies and procedures in the industry in order to ensure road safety in all areas of its activity. The Group invests in intelligent engineering and technology to ensure that its customers have the best experience possible when traveling on its toll roads. Abertis applies advanced construction and management practices, and cooperates with worldwide benchmark institutions and organizations with a global vision: to achieve the objective of zero fatalities on Abertis' toll roads. In this way, in recent years the Group has achieved an improvement in accident and mortality rates in the main units of the Group. The mortality rate continued on a downward trend in 2019, whereas the accident rate was slightly negative

6.2 Road Tech
Abertis has reached the conclusion that the management of the mobility of the future will bring important challenges but also great opportunities. Therefore, the Group has developed its "Road Tech" strategic programme, which brings together road infrastructure and new technologies, with the objective of making the Group a platform for safer, smarter and more sustainable mobility. At Abertis, innovation encompasses many areas. On the one hand, through analysis of how new mobility trends can impact the traditional business. On the other, through a commitment to a new line of business, based on Mobility as a Service (MasS), which shifts the focus of mobility away from the mode of transport to the individual, who understands mobility as a point-topoint service, with new and different needs.
Mobility as a service
Abertis Mobility Services is the Group's business line whose goal is to respond to Mobility as a Service (MasS), which aims to become the pioneer in modern and efficient mobility focused on various types of customers: on the one hand, authorities and road operators (B2A), through the subsidiary Emovis, and on the other, vehicle fleet companies (B2B), through Eurotoll, one of the largest issuers of electronic payment devices, or OBUs (On-Board-Units) in Europe. Lastly, citizens are the direct customers of subsidiaries such as Bip&Go and Bip&Drive, in the toll payment device sector.
Connected toll roads
Abertis promotes projects aimed at new mobility challenges, such as the preparation of toll roads for electric, connected or autonomous vehicles.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 20
The programme is based on the following pillars: · Solutions for intelligent toll roads and integrated mobility. The Group participates in the European C-Roads project for
cooperative transport and autonomous driving systems, to find advanced communication solutions applied to mobility between vehicles and infrastructure and application of the Internet of Things to monitor the state of the infrastructure, as well as to improve service and optimize operations. · Solutions for connected and autonomous vehicles, such as the project for the deployment of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) to exchange information on traffic conditions (SCOOP@F Project). · Solutions for electric vehicles, such as the projects for the development of wireless on-road charging (Fabric) and electric corridors for heavy vehicles (E-way corridor).
Electronic tolls and free-flow systems
The Abertis Group is committed to the innovations brought about by electronic and barrier-free toll technology thanks to its many advantages: a smoother journey, a more modern toll road adapted to its customers' payment systems, greater safety for customers and road workers, and greater respect for the environment thanks to savings in fuel consumption and polluting emissions. Abertis offers free-flow mobility solution advisory, design, implementation, operation and maintenance services through its Emovis technology and services division. The division operates some of the world's largest electronic toll infrastructure in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada. It operates in seven countries: Canada, the US, Puerto Rico, the UK, Ireland, France and Croatia. The percentage of automatic transactions or using electronic tolls increased at the Group to 83% (+1.2pp) of the total, of which 72% are uniquely electronic toll transactions (+6.9 pp). India, Argentina and Chile stand out among those that have seen the highest growth.
Main actions carried out at Road Tech in 2019
· Sanef brought into service the first 100% barrier-free toll in the country, installed on the A4 toll road (Paris-Strasbourg) near the city of Boulay.
· Toll roads (Spain) carried out a test as part of the European Inframix programme, to experiment with the coexistence of vehicles connected to conventional vehicles on a section of the AP-7 toll road.
· The Utah Department of Transportation (USA) awarded Emovis a project to implement and operate a payment system for the exclusive road use of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to manage the collection of an infrastructure financing fee from electric vehicles, to compensate for the fact that they do not pay the fuel tax with which infrastructure is financed in the US.
· Emovis renewed the toll system of the Mersey Bridge tunnels, resulting in a greater fluidity of traffic through the infrastructure.

Aggregates and results
Average Daily Traffic (ADT), the main activity indicator, experienced a comparable increase of 1.9% to reach 26,269 vehicles at 31 December 2019, which had a positive impact on Group revenue. The activity levels of most of the Group's toll road concession operators, with the exception of Chile and Argentina, improved in 2019. The detail of their ADT counts until the close at 31 December 2019 is as follows:

As shown, activity on Abertis's toll roads had experienced growth at 2019 year-end, due to solid increases in the traffic count reported in the main countries in which the Group operates. Of particular note in this connection are the levels of activity achieved in Spain (which have been rising since 2016 and continue to do so) and the increase in traffic in France.
Also noteworthy is the dynamic nature of the activity in Brazil, ongoing since 2018, following a strike in the transport industry in May of that year.
Lastly, activity in Chile slumped in 2019 as a result of the social crisis affecting the country since October 2019, which has had a negative impact on light and heavy vehicle traffic, with the Autopista del Sol toll road being the the most affected concession.

Operating income amounted to EUR 5,361 million, representing an increase of 2.0% compared to 2018, due mainly to:
· The positive performance of the activity and the impact of the average toll revision at the toll road concession operators.
· The changes in the 2019 perimeter arising from the takeover of Autopistas Trados 45 and the entry into operation of Via Paulista in January.
These impacts were partially offset by:
· The negative performance of the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso and the Argentine peso, the average exchange rates of which suffered a depreciation of 3%, 4% and 56%, respectively, compared to the average exchange rates in 2018, which led to a EUR 119 million decrease in Group revenue.
· The expiry of the concession arrangement with the Brazilian company Via Norte, belonging to the Arteris subgroup, in May 2018.

EBITDA
EBITDA reached EUR 3,737 million, up 5% on 2018. The Group's results were positively affected by the implementation of a series of measures designed to improve efficiency and optimize operating expenses, on which the Group will continue to focus in the coming years:

Financial result and depreciation
Since 1 January 2019, the Group's results have included the effects of the takeover of the Group itself and the merger between Abertis and Abertis Participaciones and, consequently, the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Abertis arising from the process of allocating the purchase price, which had a negative impact of EUR 749 million in 2019, mainly due to the annual depreciation of the revalued assets following this transaction.
The negative evolution of the financial result is due to the positive impact in 2018 from the sale of 34% of Cellnex's share capital of EUR 605 million.
Income tax
The income tax expense amounts to EUR 109 million, the tax rates in the main countries in which Abertis operates being as follows: Spain, 25%; France, 34.4%; Italy, 31.4% (27.9% in 2018); Brazil, 34%; and Chile, 27%.
Profit
The consolidated profit for 2019 exercise attributable to shareholders was EUR 352 million, following the process of allocating the purchase price and the subsequent merger between Abertis and Abertis Participaciones (without considering this effect, the profit would have been EUR 1,101 million).

The decrease in net profit is due mainly to the negative impact of the EUR 605 million capital gain obtained from the sale of 34% of Cellnex Telecom in 2018 and the negative impact of EUR 749 million in 2019 from the purchase price allocation and the subsequent merger between Abertis and Abertis Participaciones mentioned above.

At 31 December 2019, total assets amounted to EUR 42,694 million, representing an increase of 49% compared to 2018 yearend. This was due mainly to the impact of the revaluation of the assets following the merger between Abertis and Abertis Participaciones.
Approximately 60% of the total assets relate to others intangible assets (mainly concessions) in line with the nature of the Group's infrastructure management business.
Consolidated equity amounted to EUR 7,835 million, representing a 32% increase with respect to 2018 year-end which, was mainly affected by:
· The positive impact of EUR 12,845 million arising from the revaluation of assets following the process of allocating the purchase price and the merger between Abertis and Abertis Participations.
· The negative impact of the extraordinary and ordinary dividend of EUR 9,963 million and EUR 875 million respectively, both distributed during the financial year 2019.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 24
· The positive impact of the profit for the year of 352 million euros.
Investments
Total investment by the Group in 2019 amounted to EUR 670 million and related primarily to expansion (83% of the total investment), mainly in respect of:
· Increasing the capacity of the toll roads, particularly those located in Brazil (EUR 232 million) and in France to improve and extend the network (EUR 217 million).
· Increasing the capacity of the toll roads in Chile and implementing Free Flow electronic toll systems (EUR 75 million).
In this regard, Sanef is continuing to improve its network in the framework of the agreement reached with the French government in prior years to implement the "Plan Relance" with respect to French toll roads. This plan provides for improvements to the toll road network through investments of EUR 600 million in the next five to six years in exchange for an extension of the concession arrangements (two years for Sanef and three years and eight months for Sapn). To date, a cumulative investment of EUR 417 million has been made.
Of note in this regard is the fact that on 24 July 2018 Sanef entered into an agreement with the French government to implement a new investment plan to modernise its network. Under this agreement, Sanef will invest EUR 122 millons in a number of projects in exchange of an additional tariff increase for the period 2019-2021 (0,225% for Sanef and 0,218% for Sapn).
This new plan will enable the French road network to be improved on the basis of four fundamental objectives, namely, improved safety, traffic flow, service quality and environmental sustainability, while giving fresh momentum to the French economy through major work to boost activity and employment, thereby enhancing the country's business fabric.
The main projects envisaged include building various link roads, increasing the number of parking spaces for high-occupancy vehicles and various programmes to protect the network's water resources.
In the case of Arteris, work to extend and improve the toll roads is continuing, particularly with respect to the concessions that depend on the Federal State. Of note in 2019 was the road surface recovery work, the creation of dual carriageways in Fluminense (in respect of which progress is continuing to be made) and the "Contorno de Florianópolis" construction project in Litoral Sul, in accordance with the provisions of the respective concession arrangements. With respect to the concessions in Sao Paolo State, progress is being made in the new ViaPaulista concession with respect to the initial road recovery work and the construction of operational bases and toll plazas. Operations were expected to commence at the end of the year. It should also be noted that the Vianorte concession was returned to the grantor on 17 May 2018.
In Chile, the Group has implemented Free Flow electronic toll systems on Rutas del Pacífico and Autopistas del Sol during 2019. In addition, work has begun to increase the capacity of the Autopistas del Sol concession with the construction of a third lane.
In Spain, the differences in interpretation and, consequently, the various legal proceedings opened in relation to the AP-7 convention remain open.
The Group's operating investment in 2019 amounted to EUR 111 million (17% of the total).
Main investments The Group is continuing to focus its efforts on controlling operating expenses to improve efficiency, and on investing in the development and expansion of the capacity of its own assets, having invested over EUR 670 million in 2019, of which approximately 41% were in Brazil, 38% in France, 12% in Chile and 3% in Spain.
The main operations in 2019 were as follows:
2019 was characterized by continued organic and inorganic growth of the operations in Europe, the Americas and Asia, with the following acquisition being particularly noteworthy:
· Abertis reached an agreement in October to acquire an ownership interest of 50.12% in Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO) in Mexico for an approximate amount of EUR 1,500 million. The acquisition will be completed in 2020, once the necessary permits have been obtained from the Mexican public authorities.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 25
Additionally, in the context of performing operations to consolidate and bolster the Group's position as controlling shareholder with an industrial role, the following transaction is noteworthy:
· During the current year, Abertis, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Iberpistas, completed the acquisition of an additional 1.00% of the share capital of Autopistas Trados 45, totaling EUR 4.8 million, as a result of which its ownership interest amounts to 51.00% of that company's share capital. Due to this transaction, Abertis now holds a controlling interest in Autopistas Trados 45.
In parallel, and with a view to increasing the average term of the current concession portfolio, the following agreements are significant:
· In March 2018, Autopista del Sol, a subsidiary of the Abertis group in Chile, signed an agreement with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works to make new investments in Autopista del Sol (Ruta 78) for approximately EUR 150 million, in exchange for the extension of the current contract, which ends in May 2019, until March 2021. In August 2019, a new agreement was signed with the Chilean Ministry of Public Works (MOP) to extend the concession contract by 8 months, (which will end in November 2021) in order to compensate for investments, loss of income and higher costs associated with the implementation and operation of the system.
In addition to investments for inorganic growth and increasing the average life of its portfolio, Abertis has also been attentive to expanding the capacity of its motorways.
Finally, in October 2019 Abertis completed the sale of its 89.68% stake in Hipasat. This operation had no impact on the Group's results
Financial management
Gross financial debt to credit institutions at 31th December 2019 (excluding debts to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and bonds and other liabilities) amounted to 25,608 million and represents, on the one hand, 327% of equity, which is higher than at the end of 2018 (269%) due to the increase in gross financial debt detailed below, and the increase in equity mentioned above and, on the other hand, represents 60% of liabilities and equity, which is slightly higher than at the end of 2018 (56%).
On the other hand, Abertis's net financial debt (including debts to companies accounted for using the equity method and interest on loans and debentures and other liabilities) has been increased by EUR 9.035 million in 2019 up to EUR 21,573 million.
The aforementioned increase in bank debt (both gross and net) is mainly due to:
· The payment of an extraordinary dividend of EUR 9,963,410 thousand paid, mainly, through the assumption of the contractual position of Abertis HoldCo, S.A. as credited in various financing contracts for an amount of EUR 9,817,195 thousand.
· The merger of Abertis with Abertis Participaciones, S.A., which had an impact on the Group's financial debt as a result of the purchase price allocation process, amounted to EUR 740,953 thousand at 31 December 2019.
· Other additional impacts such as the payment of dividends for 2018, investments in the period and the disposal of Hispasat.
Due to its investment activity, and mainly in the concession businesses, Abertis is exposed to regulatory and financial risks: exchange rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's global risk management programme takes into account the uncertainty of the financial markets and attempts to minimize the potential adverse effects on the overall profitability of the Group as a whole by establishing financing and hedging policies in accordance with the nature of its businesses.
In practice, this continues to result in a sound financial structure, with a high average maturity of debt (5.6 years at the end of 2019 for 5.0 years at the end of 2018) and, following a policy of minimizing exposure to financial risks, a high percentage of debt is at a fixed rate or fixed through hedges (75% at the end of 2019 for 82% at the end of 2018), largely minimizing the possible effects of tensions in the credit market.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 26

In this regard, the following transactions carried out by various Group companies in 2019 are noteworthy: · Under the Euro Medium Term Note Program (EMTN) registered with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in Dublin on 6 March
2019, Abertis has issued new bonds for EUR 5,867 million. · The contracting of EUR 1,250 million in new loans with credit institutions. · The disposal of existing bilateral loans for a total amount of EUR 1,065 million, being available at 31 December 2019 an
amount of EUR 815 million · The contracting by Arteris Via Paulista of a new loan with BNDES for the amount of EUR 810 million. · The bond issue by Vias Chile for a total amount of EUR 469 million. · The bond issue by Arteris for a total amount of EUR 555 million. · The bond issue by Metropistas for a total amount of EUR 268 million. · Under the Euro Commercial Paper Programme (ECP) registered with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in Dublin on 28 June
2019, Abertis has carried out issues of promissory notes amounting to EUR 150 million already settled. It should be noted that with these and other operations, the Group reinforces its capacity to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the credit market to obtain attractive conditions and continue to generate value for its shareholders. Finally, it should be noted that the high level of cash flow generated by most of Abertis's core businesses enables it to maintain a financial balance that makes it possible to make new investments to improve the infrastructures it currently manages, as well as to continue, within the current economic and financial environment, the selective policy of growth investments developed in recent years without the need for additional capital contributions by shareholders.
Credit Quality Management
Abertis has a credit rating assigned by the rating agencies Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings. In this regard, Abertis has a long-term "BBB-" Investment-grade adequate credit quality rating awarded by the international credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Ltd. Abertis went from a long-term rating of "BBB" to one of "BBB-", owing to the impact of the methodological adaptation of its shareholder Atlantia on the Parent Company. The short-term credit rating at that date was "A-3", which was also revised in the year from "A-2".

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 27
On the other hand, in the latest report, dated October 2019, the international credit rating agency Fitch Ratings Ltd. maintained Abertis' long-term "BBB" credit rating and awarded it a short-term "F3" credit rating. Abertis's policy is to maintain an Investment-grade credit rating.

Alternative Performance Measures (APM)
Abertis considers that certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) provide useful financial information in addition to that obtained from the applicable accounting standards (EU-IFRSs) for assessing the performance of the Group and which is used by management in its decision-making processes. In this regard, in accordance with the recommendations issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
The definition and determination of main APM used is as follows:

Revenues Relates to the caption of consolidated statements of profit or loss "Operating income".

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 28

The Group considers Ebitda as an operational indicator that measures the cash generation capacity of its assets, while it is an indicator widely used by analysts, investors, credit rating agencies and other stakeholders.

Ebitda margin
Ebitda margin is a relative indicator used by the Group to analyze the operating performance of its assets, representing the relative weight of Ebitda on revenues:

Ebitda ­ Gross operating profit Revenue (Operating income) Ebitda margin

2019

2018

3,736,521 5,361,265 69.69%

3,548,971 5,255,381 67.53%

Regarding this APM, It is important to highlight that "Ebitda margin" is not a measure adopted in accounting standards and does not have a standardised meaning and, therefore, cannot be compared to the Ebitda margin of other companies.

Ebitda contribution
"Ebitda Contribution" is the percentage reflecting the proportion of the Ebitda contributed by each of the business against that of the whole Group.

Gross debt
"Gross debt" is defined as the non-current and current "Bank loans" and "Bond issues and other loans" line items as shown in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements:

Bank loans Bond issues and other loans Gross debt

2019

2018

7,965,382 17,642,791 25,608,173

4,982,698 11,029,432 16,012,130

Net debt "Net Debt" is defined as "Gross Debt" less the "Cash and cash equivalents" line item in the consolidated financial statements:

Gross debt Cash and cash equivalents Net debt

2019
25,608,173 (2,644,889) 22,963,284

2018
16,012,130 (2,737,070) 13,275,060

The Group uses the "Net Debt" as a measure of its solvency and liquidity as it indicates the current cash and equivalents in relation to its total debt liabilities. "Net Debt" and "Ebitda" derived measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and rating agencies as an indication of financial leverage.

Net Financial Debt
"Net Financial Debt" is defined as "Financial liabilities" (current and non-current) less "Other financial assets" (current and noncurrent) and "Cash and cash equivalents" line items of the consolidated financial statements.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 29

"Net Financial Debt" is an indicator of the portion of the investments financed by net financial liabilities. The reconciliation of APM with the Group consolidated financial statements is as follows:

Non-current financial liabilities Current financial liabilities Other non-current financial assets Other current financial assets Cash and cash equivalents
Net financial debt ­ continuous operations Non-current financial liabilities Current financial liabilities Other non-current financial assets Other current financial assets Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers this an important indicator because it represents the ability of the Company to expand its portfolio through the discretionary use of cash in investments for the improvements of the highway network for agreed returns in the case of the road assets and measuring how effectively the Company is redeploying resources to build a perpetual business model as it contributes for EBITDA replacement and the increase of the duration its portfolio.

Discretionary cash flow
"Discretionary cash flow" is defined as Ebitda plus/minus finance income and costs, minus income tax expense and plus/minus cash adjustments to: (i) finance income and expenses, (ii) income tax, (iii) IFRIC12 and other provisions, (iv) concession arrangements ­ financial asset model, and (v) dividends received from financial investments, associates and joint ventures.
The Group believes that the "Discretionary cash flow" is one of the most important indicators of its capacity to generate an available stream of resources from the operations, net from the mandatory uses of cash for taxes and interest expenses, to be used mainly and according to the Group strategy to repay debt, distribute dividends and expand its portfolio.

7.2 Society
i) Tax contribution
Abertis' tax policy is based on transparency and application of tax law in a responsible and prudent manner.
The Group is committed to its obligation to pay tax to contribute towards the public funds that provide the public services that are essential for the social and economic development of the countries in which it operates.
Since 2014 Abertis has voluntarily adhered to the Code of Good Tax Practices, which contains recommendations agreed between the Spanish tax authorities and the Forum of Large Companies. The company complies with the action principles set out therein.
Abertis, following the guidelines that have governed its operations since it was established, avoids the use of opaque structures, processes or systems for tax purposes, aimed at shifting profit to low tax jurisdictions (tax havens) or preventing the tax authorities from identifying the party ultimately responsible for the activities or the ultimate holder of the assets or rights involved. In addition, the Board of Directors is regularly informed of the tax policies applied.

Abertis makes a quantifiable economic and social contribution by paying tax to the authorities of the various countries in which it operates. These payments involve making a considerable effort to comply with the formalities relating to reporting and cooperation with the tax authorities, as well as significant responsibilities.
Following the OECD cash basis methodology, the total tax contribution of the Abertis Group in 2019 amounted to EUR 1,951 million, of which EUR 1,041 million relate to taxes borne5 and EUR 910 million to taxes collected6. In this connection, the Abertis Group includes all fully consolidated subsidiaries7.
In 2019, for every EUR 100 of Abertis' revenue, EUR 36 were earmarked for tax payment. Specifically, EUR 19 went towards the payment of taxes borne and EUR 17 to the payment of taxes collected.
The tax contribution per kilometer of toll roads directly managed by Abertis amounted to EUR 234,795, of which EUR 124,232 relate to taxes borne and EUR 110,563 to taxes collected

3 Included in the input tax is the profit tax paid, which amounts to EUR 528 million, as detailed below: France EUR 283 million, Spain EUR 74 million, Chile EUR 81 million, Brazil EUR 40 million, Italy EUR 29 million, Argentina EUR 19 million and Others EUR 2 million. 4 Includes United Kingdom, Holland, Puerto Rico, Mexico, India, among others.
5 Taxes borne are those which represent an effective cost for the company (payments of income tax, local taxes, indirect taxes on goods and services and employer social security contributions). 6 Taxes collected are those which do not affect profit or loss but are collected by Abertis on behalf of the tax authorities or are paid on behalf of other taxpayers (value added tax, withholdings and employee social security contributions).
7 Including the taxes paid by the Hispasat group, classified as non-current assets held for sale, amounting to EUR 23 million (EUR 16 million of taxes borne and EUR 7 million of taxes collected).

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 33
ii) Contribution to the environment
The application of preventive measures to preserve the environment and reduce pollution enables Abertis to incorporate efficiency, responsibility and sustainability into the global management model.
Abertis' strategic environmental objectives consist of carbon footprint reduction, the development of products and services based on positive environmental and social criteria, circular economy innovation and the promotion and conservation of natural capital.
The implementation of environmental management systems based on the ISO 14001 international standard constitutes the main tool for systemizing the analysis of significant environmental aspects relating to the organization's activity. An environmental management system has been implemented at Abertis facilities which account for 79% of the revenue for 2019, except for certain subsidiaries in Chile, Argentina, Puerto Rico and India, which nevertheless perform specific environmental management procedures.
Also, the total resources earmarked for measures aimed at minimizing environmental impact, including measures relating to cleaning and gardening, urban waste management, environmental impact studies and optimization of energy and water consumption, reached EUR 25.4 million, 9.3% up on the previous year.
Climate change The direct and indirect use of materials and fossil fuels is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions associated with Abertis' activities.
Formal identification of the risks and opportunities arising from climate change enables the organization to incorporate these aspects into its operations across the board, thus ensuring a joint action framework for each of the Group's business units. However, the actions taken differ depending on each country's specific market features.
Abertis thus makes an annual carbon footprint calculation in accordance with the international standards in force with a twofold objective: to achieve accountability and monitor performance in terms of contribution to climate change. The analysis, assessment and external publication of Abertis' carbon footprint by organizations such as Carbon Disclosure Project helps us to target our actions so that the established reduction goals can be achieved.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, encompassing direct energy consumption and indirect emissions from electricity, dropped by 4.7% with respect to the previous year, in keeping with Abertis' strategic objectives. Scope 3 emissions, which include those from vehicles travelling on toll roads, account for 99.5% of the Group's total emissions. In 2019 total CO2e emissions decreased by 3.1% in absolute terms to 20.4 million tones. In revenue-related terms, the increase has been higher up to 4.9%, at 3,984.6 tonnes of CO2e per EUR million.
The main steps taken in order to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions include the following: the replacement of the vehicle fleet with less polluting vehicles; the implementation of energy efficiency measures; the installation of mechanisms for generating clean electricity; and the replacement of lighting.
The following actions were taken to reduce scope 3 emissions: the recovery of construction waste; the implementation of procedures to reduce consumption of materials and water, the installation of electric vehicle charging stations; the rollout of plans for the use of alternative fuels in infrastructure; and the use of asphalt capable of reducing the emissions generated by vehicles.
Circular economy Establishing direct and indirect waste recovery procedures enables the life cycle of these products to be altered so that they can re-enter the production cycle as raw materials. Innovation and cooperation with different stakeholders are key for reducing the environmental impact generated by Abertis' activities.
In this regard, Abertis' main goal is to recover construction waste, since this is the largest category of waste generated (96.2% of all non-hazardous waste in 2019). Thus, in 2019 34,680.2 tones were recovered in Spain, Brazil and Italy, representing 3.4% of the total volume generated.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 34
Hazardous and non-hazardous waste increased significantly overall to 1,066,262 tones, 99.9% of which is non-hazardous waste. How each category of waste is processed varies depending on the waste manager and the legal framework in force in each country. 4.1% of hazardous and non-hazardous waste was recovered, whilst 95.5% ended up in landfill.
Biodiversity and natural capital A total of 1,667 km of toll roads managed by Abertis in Brazil, France, Spain, Chile and Italy pass through specially protected natural areas for biodiversity. The initiatives undertaken aim to protect and showcase natural areas, and they also have a positive effect on conservation of the biodiversity to which those areas are home. Environmental surveillance and environmental liability recovery programmes, the installation of wildlife crossings and fences, compensatory planting, carrying out awareness campaigns and environmental education in conjunction with the local communities, and emergency, conservation and cleaning plans are the main actions undertaken to ensure the achievement of the established objectives. Also, the Group's toll roads periodically monitor noise levels in order to identify points of high noise pollution requiring specific action. In 2019 measurements were taken at 41% of the total kilometers of toll road in Spain, Brazil, Chile and Italy. In addition, noise-reducing asphalt continues to be used and reforestation programmes continue to be implemented in order to mitigate the acoustic impact of the infrastructure.
iii) Contribution to the community
The generation of positive synergies with the local community is one of Abertis' strategic objectives, and the achievement of this goal is based on the development of projects in conjunction with the main stakeholders on aspects relating to road safety, the environment, culture and social accessibility. In 2019 resources earmarked for community projects and sponsorship totalled EUR 3.7 million, with a participation in over 260 initiatives. 98.1% of the projects executed are social investments and initiatives aligned with the long-term business, 73.4% were carried out in Spain and Latin America and 76.2% are linked to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being); SDG 4 (Quality Education); and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). In addition to its involvement in local community projects, Abertis participates in various general and sector-specific associations, sharing expert knowledge to achieve operational, strategic and social improvements. In 2019 the Group's various subsidiaries formed part of 40 associations with which a total of 70 meetings were held.
The Abertis Foundation The Abertis Foundation headquarters, Castellet castle, also house the UNESCO International Centre for Mediterranean Biosphere Reserves, constituting a flagship for the local community. The Foundation's activity is based on the following pillars: road safety; social action; and care for the environment. In 2019 the United Nations granted the Abertis Foundation membership of its Road Safety Collaboration Group, making Abertis the first infrastructure sector company to form part of this group. The Foundation also implemented various awareness campaigns to improve road safety ("Puedo Esperar", "Te queda una vida", "El Apagón") in Spain, Chile and Italy, and promoted the study "The Impact of Road Traffic Accidents with Child Victims" in partnership with the London School of Economics. The "Declaration of Castellet for the Protection of Biodiversity" and participation in the COP25 activities in Madrid are some examples of the environmental initiatives undertaken in 2019 which, along with the other activities carried out, are detailed in the Foundation's annual report, which is available on its website.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 35
Abertis Chairs The International Network of Abertis Chairs presented the XVI International Prizes for Transport Infrastructure Management and Road Safety, recognizing the best work submitted in the national editions of the same award (Spain, France, Puerto Rico, Chile and Brazil).
iv) Quality management and customer orientation
Abertis's strategic objectives relating to user and customer stakeholders are, on the one hand, the provision of a quality service (in terms of fluidity, convenience and customer information) and, on the other hand, the development of quality products and services that have a positive environmental and social impact and demonstrate good governance. Consequently, the lines of work on the basis of which the specific quality management procedures and actions are developed involve the implementation of international management systems, namely, quality, road safety and information security management systems, with a constant focus on ensuring continuous improvement. Thus, there is a quality management system -in accordance with ISO 9001- in place at Abertis facilities which account for 61.9% of the year's revenue, and 52.4% is certified.
Communication and engagement channels There are various customer and user communication and engagement channels, including the more traditional channels, such as telephone support and customer service provided in person, as well as general media and social networks. The rollout and use of digital channels to promote real-time communication, together with specific maintenance information, is becoming increasingly common across the different business units, thus meeting the expectations of this stakeholder group. Specific toll road user satisfaction surveys are carried out on a regular basis to identify the most highly valued aspects, as well as the areas of work linked to the continuous service quality improvement system. In 2019 Sanef, Metropistas, A4 Holding and Emovis carried out quality and satisfaction surveys and were able to incorporate the improvements into the action plans for the coming year. Also, all the subsidiaries have formal mechanisms in place for receiving queries, complaints and suggestions. These tools are widely used by users, and in 2019 they received a total of 1.3 million communications, of which 95.3% were queries and 99.9% were addressed.
v) Supplier and supply chain management
The rejection of all forms of corruption, the development of products and services that have a positive ESG impact and the generation of positive synergies with the local community are the main strategic objectives as far as supplier management is concerned. Added to this is the cross-cutting impact of subcontracted companies on the achievement of the other strategic objectives established by Abertis. Abertis is aware of this significant contribution, and its relationship with suppliers is therefore based on the parameters established in the Code of Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility policy, both of which are clearly set out in the procurement policy in force and in the regulations on procurement operations. The implementation of electronic procurement systems contributes towards the alignment of parameters and procedures and also facilitates data collection, which together contribute towards continuous improvement. In 2019 work was undertaken to harmonize supplier assessment and approval criteria across the various business units, irrespective of the technological tools used. 2019 also saw the commencement of work to migrate to a supplier assessment platform that is directly linked to suppliers' economic management.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 36

Supplier assessment in accordance with environmental, social and good governance criteria, together with the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in tenders and competitions, is one of the mechanisms that have been established to ensure compliance with corporate standards beyond organizational boundaries. The main activities performed by the organization's suppliers include miscellaneous maintenance services, specific machinery and equipment, raw materials, fuel, connectivity products and other external professional services.
Abertis worked with a total of 13,915 suppliers in 2019, of which 3,811 are considered principal, 655 strategic and 701 critical. 27.9% of the strategic suppliers and 25% of the critical suppliers were assessed on the basis of environmental, social and good governance parameters, and a total of 12 critical suppliers were audited. 95.8% of competitions and tenders carried out in 2019 included social and environmental clauses.
Spain, Brazil and Chile have a supplier assessment tool that enables suppliers to be rated in accordance with specific CSR criteria.

The economic impact associated with Abertis' level of procurement is high, and the local community is therefore involved where possible. Local procurement in 2019 dropped slightly to 83.7% of all purchases made.

7.3 Human team

i) Talent management
The people that make up Abertis' human team share the organization's values and principles, which focus on achieving the strategic objectives affecting this particularly significant stakeholder.
Guaranteeing occupational health and safety, developing a satisfied and committed team that is aligned with the organizational values, ensuring equal opportunities, enhancing job quality and attracting, developing and retaining professional talent in a multicultural setting are all strategic objectives for which various plans and programmes have been developed.
The characteristics of the workforce remained constant in relation to previous years, in terms of both gender and type of contract and working hours. 95% of executives are from the local community in which the organization operates

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 37
Diversity and equality The organization's commitment to equal opportunities and non-discrimination, as well as the promotion of diversity, is set out clearly in both its code of ethics and its strategic objectives. Specific training and the rollout of work-life balance measures contribute towards furthering gender balance. 21.8% of executive positions and 27.9% of management positions are held by women, which shows that the upward trend established in recent years has stabilized. Also, 229 employees availed themselves of parental leave in 2019, 76.9% of whom were women, with a retention rate of 89.6% for women and 98% for men. The existence of specific equal opportunities regulations varies depending on the different countries in which the organization operates, not all of which lay down the same requirements. In Spain, in addition to the obligation to have equality plans in place, there are other requirements, namely: non-discrimination in selection processes; training and promotion; the obligation to provide the same remuneration for similar positions; and the establishment of diversity hiring quotas. The existing differences in remuneration are linked mainly to length of service and the specific characteristics of the various job positions. In global terms, women's remuneration was 70.4% of men's in 2019, virtually unchanged with respect to the previous year. Abertis meets the legal requirements relating to the hiring of differently abled employees, both directly and through the application of alternative measures. The total number of differently abled employees increased slightly to 382.3 in the equivalent average headcount.
ii) Professional development
Job quality, talent promotion and training and knowledge networks are the key components of professional development management at Abertis.
Talent promotion Talent retention and the consolidation of long-term relationships that enable professional and personal growth are the cornerstones for achieving one of Abertis' strategic objectives, namely to ensure that at least 62% of executive and management vacancies are filled by internal candidates. The performance appraisal is one of the key tools for professional development and, together with the management by objectives system, aims to align efforts and actions towards the achievement of the organization's strategic objectives. 100% of executive positions, 96.6% of management positions and 59.2% of the rest of the workforce are involved in a management by objectives system. Also, the executive development programmes establish a proactive training and growth framework focusing on the internal promotion of the employees forming part of Abertis' human team. A total of 55 people from all countries participated in the Abantis programme in 2019. Also, in global terms, a total of 237 men and 128 women were promoted internally during the year. Work climate surveys and meetings linked to the performance review processes help assess and identify improvement actions. The frequency of these surveys and meetings varies across the different business units. In 2019 Metropistas, Emovis in France and a number of the subsidiaries in Brazil conducted a work climate survey, the results of which will contribute towards the assessment and development of action for the coming years.
Training and knowledge networks Knowledge sharing and the promotion of best practices constitute the foundation for developing training and professional development plans and activities at Abertis. The Connectis platform has been consolidated as an internal knowledge network for all Group subsidiaries, with over 100 chats started in 2019. It involves the following departments: the technical area (engineering, operations and technology); the customer service area; legal advisory; compliance; and procurement.

2019 CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 38
With the exception of three subsidiaries in Brazil, every business unit has training plans in place. These training plans enable the training needs of the human team to be identified and planned in keeping with the organization's objectives and the job requirements. The average number of training hours in 2019 was 17.5 hours per employee (19.1 hours for men and 15 hours for women), and the related economic investment amounted to EUR 2.7 million. A total of 13,736 hours of corporate social responsibility training were provided, involving mainly Brazil, France, Spain and Chile.
iii) Health and safety
The areas of Road Safety and the Smart Risk Programme create a framework for managing occupational health and safety at the organization. These areas are closely linked to one another, and they share positive synergies and the same strategic objective: 0 accidents and 0 deaths.
Management and monitoring The implementation of occupational health and safety management systems at each of the business units enables the levels of risk associated with the different job positions to be formally identified. Abertis complies with the legal requirements in force by rolling out measures and action plans aimed at removing risk and thereby reducing occupational accidents. 90.6% of revenue for 2019 has an occupational health and safety management system in place, based on both international standards (such as OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001) and in-house standards relating to the legislation in force. Operations in India and Argentina, a subsidiary in Brazil and a business unit in Puerto Rico do not have this kind of system in place. The health and safety committees allow employees to participate directly in the oversight and monitoring of the action plans and related management systems. In 2019 these committees met 378 times to discuss issues related to risk assessment, follow-up on accidents that had taken place, improved protective equipment and developments in training activities. 77.5% of the direct workforce and 72.8% of the indirect workforce are covered by the health and safety committees. Both direct and indirect employees are covered by the management systems in place. This means that in addition to the employees, a total of 13,856 indirect workers participate in the different preventive and training activities provided under these systems. In 2019 45,692 hours of occupational health and safety training were given to workers associated with the organization.
Accident rate The total number of recordable accidents of direct employees in 2019 was 287, of which 206 involved loss of days. 66.9% of the recordable accidents and 70.4% of the accidents resulting in sick leave occurred among men. There were also three workers fatalities, one in Chile (direct worker), one in Argentina (indirect worker) and one in Brazil (indirect worker). The global downward trend in the number of accidents continues to be consolidated with a reduction of 25.4% in 2019. The variation across countries is similar, although Spain, Puerto Rico, Chile and Italy experienced an increase in the number of occupational accidents resulting in sick leave in 2019. The number of accidents involving indirect workers also increased slightly to a total of 207 accidents in 2019. The main causes of occupational accidents include the following: same-level falls; handling moving objects; contusions, road traffic accidents, collisions; and stress. The incidence, frequency and severity rates, which relate the number of occupational accidents to the number of hours worked and the number of employees, evolved differently. The global incidence and frequency rates decreased significantly by 20.5% and 23%, respectively, to 16.2 to 8.7, due to the reduction in the number of accidents. The severity rate increased to 0.67, due to the changes in days lost in France, Spain, Argentina and Italy.

Future prospects
Foreseeable evolution
During 2020 exercise, the Abertis strategic plan 2019-21 is expected to be further developed, focusing on the creation of value through three pillars:
Financial flexibility
Increased financial flexibility: with a view to 2020, it is expected to continue developing a sound financial structure with a high average maturity of debt and following a policy of minimising exposure to financial risks.
Efficiencies
In the area of efficiencies, the Group will continue the efforts made in recent years, not only in the Corporation but also in the various business units. Specifically, the lines of action set out in the efficiency plan defined until 2021, focused on improving EBITDA through an optimization of operating and personnel expenses and revenues.
Growth
The Group intends to continue to focus its energies on growth (with a clear commitment to international development), a strategic priority that is already being carried out through the search for new operations, as well as extensions to existing concessions in exchange for new investments. All of this is done with the aim of maintaining itself as one of the leading groups and a reference in the motorway infrastructure sector, without forgetting its vocation for service to customers, public authorities and society in general. The Group will continue to analyze opportunities in its more traditional markets, such as Europe and America, with the aim of promoting a balanced mix of new and more mature concessions in its portfolio, always attentive to new possibilities for the Group and its shareholders. In this regard, in relation to the agreement reached in 2019 for the acquisition of 50.12% of the Mexican group Red de Carreteras de Occidente ("RCO"), it is expected to obtain the approvals of the regulatory market in that country during the first half of 2020, which will allow the takeover. In parallel with the development of the strategic financial plan, the signature programs (strategic programs) of Road Safety and Road Tech coordinate and ensure the mainstreaming of their underlying principles, ensuring that the actions taken are aligned with the achievement of the objectives of both programs. The deployment of these programmes will continue over the coming years, considering them to be a key aspect of the Abertis Group's value creation model. Similarly, next year will be the last year in which the Corporate Social Responsibility Master Plan (CSRMP) will be in force, and it will therefore be necessary to prepare the evaluation of the plan, while at the same time developing the actions of direct involvement with stakeholders, and to assess the options for the continuity of the plan, ensuring its integration into the organization's strategy and its link to the material aspects updated during 2019.

Stakeholders and materiality
Stakeholders
The update of the materiality analysis carried out in 2019 made it possible to review the global stakeholder map, as well as the specificities of each stakeholder, partially incorporating the activities of Mobility Services and considering the specific characteristics of the countries included in the Abertis Group after the previous materiality analysis. The global stakeholder map for 2019 retains almost all the nuances identified to date. In addition to the change in the composition and characteristics of shareholders and the investment community already mentioned in 2018, the incorporation of public authorities and private sector organisations as customers for the services provided by the mobility services business line should be noted. These customers include toll road managers, both public and private, and also include the end user of the services as a relevant agent in the development of the activity. The expectations of all these stakeholders are similar to those already identified in the case of the toll road business, with a high level of relationship linked to the development of turnkey projects. Also, the type of products and services provided by the suppliers of the mobility services business is different from that of the toll road business, being considered critical in this case, both as a result of the role played by the activity in the value chain and of the type of impacts generated, especially in relation to products of a technological nature. The review and incorporation of the stakeholder maps of Italy and India has not given rise to significant changes in their characteristics. The incorporation of the individual stakeholder maps of each of the subsidiaries of the mobility services business, present in various countries, will remain pending and will complete the updating exercise being carried out this year.

APPENDIX TO THE 2019 DIRECTOR'S REPORT- FOLLOW UP OF THE CSR MASTER PLAN 4
Materiality
The work performed in 2019 on the materiality update was based on the reference standards already included in the previous materiality, together with others published in the intervening period, and include the principles and standards of Accountability regarding stakeholder engagement, ISO 26000, the GRI standards (SRS), the United Nations Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Ruggie Principles of Business and Human Rights, the ILO Fundamental Conventions and the OECD guidelines for multinational companies, in addition to the management system standards related to the organization's activities and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures.
Based on the previous review of the results and methodology of the current materiality, the life cycle of the organization's two main businesses was reviewed and formalised. In addition, a specific sector benchmarking and a geographical benchmarking were carried out, in which all the countries in which both toll road and mobility services activities are carried out were considered.
The life cycle of the toll road business retained all the attributes already identified, without any significant changes, while the life cycle of the mobility services business was formally defined. This exercise made it possible to identify the diversity of suppliers involved in the value chain as well as the social characteristics of the products and services provided by this business line. These include ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) products, among which electronic tolling systems, traffic management, intelligent urban mobility and connected vehicles can be found, all with a very specific and relevant component of accessibility, security and confidentiality in the activity's value chain.
The comparative analysis of the industry included various private organizations that share the same sector of activity with both toll roads and mobility services, although in some cases their characteristics differ from those of Abertis. Based on the public information available from the organizations analysed, and on the parameterization of those aspects considered to be relevant and very relevant, environmental, social and good governance aspects were detected which, taken as a whole, are considered to be very relevant for each of the sectors. This separation and analysis evidenced the relevance of aspects such as governance, occupational health and safety and work and working conditions, which are common to all sectors of activity, together with considerations of a more specific nature such as environmental aspects in the case of toll roads and aspects of human rights and access to technology in the case of mobility services.
The geographical benchmarking included both a review of the countries already analysed (Brazil, France, Spain, Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico) and an analysis of the countries in which Abertis currently operates, including Italy, India, Ireland, the UK, the US, Canada, Hungary and Croatia. Based on the information published by the government websites of each of the countries and some specific studies available, those priority aspects were detected for each of the countries, regardless of the economic activity carried on in them. Aspects related to human rights, fundamental labour rights, environmental considerations, prevention of corruption and aspects of the relationship with local communities have been explained as very relevant.
In addition to these sources of information, a detailed analysis was also made of external Spanish and international regulations on environmental, social and good governance matters, to which internal regulations were added, which include the policies and codes of conduct in force at the Abertis Group together with the management systems and other related procedures implemented.
The main developments in the material aspects of the Abertis Group include occupational health and safety outside the organizational frontiers for the toll road business, together with the aspects of human rights, employment, occupational health and safety and security and confidentiality outside the organisation for the mobility services business. All the actions taken were documented and make up the 2019 Materiality Dossier, which was used as the basis for the preparation of the infographic presented below. The objective thereof is to graphically illustrate the material aspects identified in each stage of the value chain together with the organizational frontiers inherent to them. It is worth considering the inclusion, next year, of the direct participation of the stakeholders of each one of the countries to validate the prioritisation made in this year's update.

CSR Master Plan
Implementation status
The 2016-2020 CSR Master Plan (CSRMP) is in its final phase, with one year remaining for the completion and subsequent evaluation of the objectives initially established. The update of the materiality analysis carried out, the stakeholder involvement work planned for the coming year and the Group's new strategic plan will serve as the basis for assessing the changes required within the framework of the strategy related to the cross-cutting corporate social responsibility management at Abertis. Responsibility for monitoring and managing the CSRMP is held by the Abertis Group's Board of Directors, and coordination at operational level is carried out by the Group's Corporate Reputation and Communication Department. The degree of achievement of the CSRMP objectives remains similar to the levels of 2018, without significant progress in overall terms. The trend is positive in some of the targets set, although the manner in which certain of them are formulated makes it difficult to establish a specific degree of achievement (as is the case with the quantitative target of axis 1, zero non-compliance, or those of axis 4, zero deaths and zero accidents). The infographic on the following page shows, within the time frame of the CSRMP, the trend associated with each of the quantitative objectives and the degree of their achievement. In 2019, the Company continued to work on the Global Reporting Initiative by continuing to participate in the Corporate Leadership Group on Digital Reporting and through its involvement in a workshop on the evaluation of the implementation of the Non-Financial Information Law in Spain among small- and medium-sized enterprises. The Abertis Group also continued to take part in external assessments in the areas of environmental, social and good governance performance, although their number fell this year due to the change in the type of company from listed to unlisted. In addition to the preparation of the questionnaire of the Carbon Disclosure Project 2019 initiative (available on its website), the external agencies MSCI and Sustainalytics included the Abertis Group in the scope of their assessment work. The content of this chapter, structured according to the different strategic axes of the CSRMP, provides detailed qualitative and quantitative information on environmental, social and good governance performance. An infographic introduces each axis and summarises both the strategic objectives and the quantitative objectives, as well as the material aspects, the fundamental matters of ISO 26000 and the related Sustainable Development Goals.

Organisational culture
The compliance model implemented at the Abertis Group seeks to ensure an organisational culture based on ethical behaviour, anti-corruption and abidance by the law. The associated governance structure and the awareness and training actions implemented by each of the countries contribute to ensuring the correct functioning of the existing whistleblowing channels, together with the impact on the change in behaviour of all the stakeholders involved.

The total number of pending complaints for the year increased 29.2% compared to 2018, reaching a total of 62. 87.4% of total complaints classified as open during the year were resolved. Of these, 57.9% were discarded, 18.8% involved warnings, 12.8% other disciplinary measures and 10.5% ended in the dismissal of the persons involved.
The number of cases of non-compliance in 2019 continued the trend of recent years and increased to 181. This change had an impact on the total number of complaints ending in warnings, which increased accordingly.

Rejection of all forms of corruption
The Abertis Group's compliance model includes a standardized anti-corruption model, which means that all the Group's business units have the same kind of internal rules that seek to prevent acts that entail a greater risk of corruption at the Abertis Group.

These rules also describe the operational controls implemented by each business unit to prevent corruption. In turn, Abertis's Internal Audit function audited the degree of implementation of the design of the anti-corruption model in all the Group's business units.

Compliance training contributes to the implementation of an organisational culture. The compliance model establishes the mandatory nature of the compliance training provided annually by the Abertis Group's various compliance functions. 44.5% of the executives and heads of department received anti-corruption training, 40.5% on the Code of Ethics and 35.3% on workplace harassment.

It is also worth highlighting the game developed in Brazil to reinforce the rollout of the compliance programme, which through classroom training sessions involved almost 4,000 participants, representing over 80% of the total number of employees. Similarly, online training on the code of ethics and corruption prevention was provided to suppliers and service providers in Brazil, reaching 46% of strategic suppliers. Brazil's Integrity Programme, which includes these actions, received external recognition in an assessment of more than 500 organisations in the country in terms of compliance.

With regard to management areas, of particular note was the implementation at Abertis, Abertis Autopistas España and Sanef of electronic platforms which allow the crime prevention model to be supervised and evaluated. However, at Sanef the focus is on anti-corruption prevention in order to comply with the provisions of the French anti-corruption law Sapin II. In addition, in Brazil and Sanef, processes were implemented so that the compliance and purchasing functions can evaluate the corruption risks of their suppliers and partners. The implementation in Brazil of an online platform for the management of legal requirements and socio-environmental risks is another significant development.

Lastly, work began on obtaining ISO 37001 certification for the anti-bribery management system in 2020. Once Abertis obtains this certification, it will be rolled out across all the business units. Therefore, Abertis has completed the design of the administrative compliance management supervision system with respect to the environmental, labour, personal data protection, tax and financial information areas. In 2020 these areas will be supervised using Abertis's electronic platform.

The accession in 2019 of Spanish toll roads to Transparency International Spain's Integrity Forum, together with Brazil toll roads' prior adherence to the Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption promoted by the Ethos Institute, explicitly evidence the Group's commitment to preventing corruption, while publicising the existence of associated rules and procedures that can be effectively applied to all stakeholders.

Excellence in good governance
The Annual Corporate Governance Report details the existing good governance mechanisms at the Group, while complying with the requirements of transparency and accountability in this area. Also, there is considerable information related to this aspect that is publicly available on the Group's website.
The creation of the Board of Directors committees in 2019 affects the total number of recommendations of the Code of Good Governance applicable to the Company, which increases to 42. Abertis complies with 84% of the recommendations (18% evidence partial compliance), while it does not comply with a total of 7.
The existence of complaint mechanisms allows the organisation to channel and respond to all communications related to the rules and procedures in force, with regard to both cross-cutting issues (code of ethics) and other more specific areas (environmental or social). Almost all complaints were addressed and resolved in the year, and are detailed in each of the parts of this document.
Work on incorporating human rights aspects into due diligence procedures has begun and is at an embryonic stage. Accordingly, it is important to continue working in an integrated manner with the supplier compliance and evaluation procedures in order to incorporate human rights aspects into the organization's decisions.

Axis 2: Eco-efficiency
The strategic objectives of Axis 2 of the CSR Master Plan consist of reducing the carbon footprint, boosting the circular economy and developing products and services that have a positive environmental impact. The material impacts managed under this strategic axis consist of energy and material consumption, the generation of greenhouse gas emissions and particulate pollutants in the toll road use phase, waste generation and the possibility of waste recovery, as well as the potential for developing transformation incentives through the creation of products and services that have a positive environmental impact, such as the promotion of electric vehicle recharging stations, or the development of real-time traffic management technology.
There is an environmental management system -in accordance with ISO 14001- in place at Abertis facilities covering 79% of revenue. Such systems enable aspects that have a significant environmental impact to be formally identified, actions to be planned in order to manage these aspects and related measurement indicators to be compiled. Although these systems have not been put in place in Chile, Argentina, Puerto Rico and India, specific environmental management procedures are carried out in those countries.

With respect to the toll roads in Brazil, as part of the rollout of the environmental management systems, a digital platform and related application have been designed so that any environmental infringements relating to the construction projects or the operation and management of infrastructure in the country can be reported directly. Also, Mobility Services in France has held specific meetings directly involving employees in order to maintain the management systems that have been implemented, including the environmental management system.

Carbon footprint reduction
2019 saw the continuation of work to include the climate change-related risks and opportunities in the formal risk assessment systems in place at the organisation. Up-to-date risk maps for each country are expected to be rolled out in the coming year in order to specify and contextualize those risks with a view to continuing work to establish the financial value of those risks and opportunities.
The greenhouse gas emissions generated in the use phase of the toll road activity lifecycle constitute virtually the entire carbon footprint of the organization (99.5% of total emissions in 2019). Since various stakeholder groups are able to have an effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the established targets differ depending on the organizational boundaries concerned.
The fuel consumption of the vehicle fleet and electricity consumption are the main sources of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 3 currently consists of the emissions arising from material and water consumption, waste management, employee journeys and toll road use. Studying these categories and any changes arising in their regard on an annual basis enables the organization to evaluate carbon footprint performance over the year. Participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire, the responses to which are publicly accessible, focuses on reporting carbon footprint performance in a specific and technical manner.
The organization's total emissions in 2019 decreased by 3.1% with respect to the previous year and currently stand at 20.4 million tonnes. The reduction affects both scope 1 and 2 emissions (4.7% lower) and scope 3 emissions (3.1% lower). This trend applies to virtually all the countries except for Italy and India, where progress has been made in compiling information, which has affected the total data for the year.
The relative aggregates with respect to revenue performed in a similar manner, and the organisation's carbon intensity now stands at 3,984.6 tonnes of CO2 per million euros (4.9% lower than the previous year) overall and 21 tonnes of CO2 per million euros (6.4% lower than the previous year) considering only scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The reductions in fuel consumption affected the changes in the scope 1 emissions, the decrease in which exceeded the increase in electricity consumption which led to the rise in scope 2 emissions. The changes in material consumption and journeys occurred in the scope 3 categories, which dropped in 2019, these being the main reasons for the reduction in emissions of this scope.
In 2019 a pilot project for the use of the permeable paving technique, an innovative methodology that improves road surface durability against oil spills, was implemented. This prevents significant infrastructure damage, thus improving maintenance-related efficiency and reducing consumption of related materials and energy, as well as emissions relating to both maintenance and use.

The Italian toll roads have worked on the design of an alternative fuel dissemination plan in accordance with the legislative requirements in force in Italy. Also, the electric vehicle charging station dissemination plan was rolled out with the aim of having the entire lengths of two of the toll roads covered by these stations in 2025. The Spanish toll roads have a fleet renewal plan in place, in addition to the preventive maintenance plan, by means of which a portion of the fleet is replaced each year. At present, 52% of the fleet is categorized as low emission.
Work to replace lighting with LED lighting continued in Spain and Brazil, and eco-friendly wall paints were used on buildings located in service areas of the toll roads in Italy. These paints absorb atmospheric pollutants and are capable of reducing the energy requirements associated with air conditioning in summer, thanks to their reflective properties. There are plans to extend the use of construction materials of this kind to other toll roads in 2020.

The total energy consumption for 2019, which is directly related to the scope 1 and 2 emissions, dropped by 3.2% overall to 404,821 MWh, due mainly to the decrease in the consumption of liquid fuels, a category which represents 41.3% of the total direct energy consumption for the year. LPG consumption also decreased by 15.8% to a total of 980.6 MWh. Lastly, the increase in electricity consumption rendered this the organization's most important energy source, representing 55.3% of the total direct energy consumed in the year. Own renewable energy sources remained unchanged with respect to the previous year. In addition to the hydroelectric energy plant in Spain and the solar energy microgeneration plants in Brazil, two solar PV plants were installed on the Italian toll roads in 2019. The total energy from these sources decreased slightly, due mainly to weather conditions, which gave rise to lower production at the hydroelectric plant.

In addition to the environmental management systems that have been implemented, which consider energy consumption to be an environmental aspect with a significant impact, and the energy audits performed in some of the countries in which the organisation operates according to the legislation in force, the Italian toll roads are working to implement an energy management system.
Also, actions to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants relating to the vehicles that use the toll roads continued in 2019. Progress needs to be made with respect to the adjustment of estimates, involving all the countries, in order to fine tune the calculations and thus be able to measure the results of the actions implemented in this regard.

Circular economy innovation
The use of recycled materials in the maintenance and construction processes associated with infrastructure management enables waste to be recovered and returned to the production cycle, thus reducing the impact associated with the primary extraction of materials of this kind. There is a positive trend in the consumption of recycled materials, particularly in the case of granules and asphalt agglomerate, the level of consumption of which is high. 14.7% of the materials consumed in 2019 -23.6% in the case of asphalt agglomerate- were recycled, which represents a 9.4% increase in absolute terms with respect to the previous year and 17.7% in percentage terms.

Products and services development

The R+D projects performed in 2019 and detailed in Axis 4 of this appendix envisage the future rollout of new products associated with both electric and connected vehicles, the implementation of which generates a positive environmental and social impact.

The more widespread use of electronic tolls as the main payment mechanism consolidates the upward trend that caused the objective initially established in the CSR Master Plan to be amended. In 2019, the level of use of this payment method, which enables the greenhouse gas emissions associated with stopping to be reduced, reached 59.4% of total revenue and 67.2% of total transactions, representing an increase of 3.9% and 2.9%, respectively, compared to the previous year.

Cooperation with different stakeholder groups to develop products and services that have a positive environmental and social impact guarantees the involvement of all stakeholders in the value chain of the business. This is especially important as far as suppliers are concerned, given the significant effect on management of the impact of infrastructure construction and maintenance actions in particular. The different countries take steps to involve suppliers in the application of the environmental and employment procedures in place. Also, supplier assessment and selection based on environmental, social and good governance criteria enables aspects relating to the CSR Master Plan to be incorporated when making procurement and hiring decisions. Work was performed in 2019 to standardize assessment criteria independently of the system used to implement them.
The total number of suppliers with whom the organisation worked in 2019 dropped with respect to the previous year to 13,915, 27.4% of which are the principal suppliers. 655 in total are considered strategic suppliers and 701 are critical suppliers, due to the type of product or service that they provide. 27.9% of the strategic suppliers and 25% of the critical suppliers were assessed on the basis of environmental, social and good governance parameters. Also, a total of 12 audits were performed in Spain on this type of supplier, and a specific findings report was issued for each of them.

Axis 3: Integrating into the community
Positive synergies with the local community
Cooperation with organizations and projects in the local communities where the organisation operates, both directly and through the Abertis Foundation, is the main framework for relations with a territory. Participation in professional associations and the prioritisation of local suppliers complete the actions that seek to establish mechanisms of involvement, which aim to increase the value created for the local community beyond the carrying on of Abertis' main activity. The total number of initiatives in which the Group has participated in 2019 has decreased in relation to 2018, reaching 260 and EUR 3.7 million, 98.1% of which include social investments and initiatives aligned with the business. Spain, Europe and Latin America account for the majority of the projects, and there were no significant changes compared with previous years.

The installation of wildlife crossings continues to positively affect the fragmentation of the land and the associated impacts on the natural species living alongside the toll roads. Of particular note was the work carried out in Brazil to systematise environmental procedures related to fauna, the suppression of vegetation, waste management, relations with suppliers and significant environmental aspects in general, which are currently in the training phase for their effective implementation across all the concession operators. Partnerships with beekeepers for the preservation of biodiversity in France also continued, and awareness and waste and plastic collection campaigns were implemented in India and France.
The total number of animals run over increased slightly compared to 2018, reaching a total of 18,811 cases, mainly in Brazil and Spain. In addition to the programmes to reclaim environmental liabilities, reforestation initiatives were carried out which in 2019 saw the replanting of 249,734 examples of plant species. This year-on-year increase was due to the actions implemented in Brazil, Chile, Italy and India under the specific action programmes related to the construction and maintenance projects performed.

The installation of noise barriers and reforestation were the main actions implemented to remedy the acoustic impact of the infrastructures. A total de 3,333.9 km in 2019 were subject to noise impact studies. Air quality also has an impact on the natural species that live around toll roads and, therefore, the main indicators of pollutant emissions from the organization's direct activity are estimated annually, considering that actions to promote less polluting vehicles contribute to the reduction of emissions from vehicles travelling on the toll roads.

Axis 4: Safety and quality
Guaranteeing and fostering road safety
One of Abertis's two strategic axes, Road Safety, defines the importance of road safety to the Group's operations business. This material topic is one of the areas involving a greater capacity to create value and reduce adverse impacts in society and, accordingly, a variety of activities are carried out in the context of infrastructure operation and management, together with awareness and innovation actions. 52.4% of the revenue of the toll road business has a road safety management system in place and 40.3% is based on the ISO 39001 international standard. It should be added that Chile implements an emergency and incident response management system certified in accordance with the ISO 22350 standard and has developed an accident prediction model.

The maintenance and operations business has a direct impact on some of the most significant road safety risks. Accordingly, preventive measures and measures to adapt infrastructure are planned annually and rolled out in an integrated manner with ordinary operations. The performance of emergency drills in Spain and Brazil, implementation of new technological systems for real time traffic monitoring in Italy and Chile and monitoring of maintenance activities in Argentina, signalling measures in Spain, Chile, Puerto Rico and Brazil, the installation of metal barriers in Brazil and India, and lighting measures, reflective elements and plastic median barriers in Chile are a few examples of the actions carried out during the year.
Awareness campaigns are the main mechanism for influencing road user behaviour, which is another issue with a significant impact on the risk of traffic accidents. In 2019 a total of 740 road safety campaigns were run in all the countries in which Abertis carries on business activities. These include most notably the repetition of the internationally recognised "El Apagón" campaign in Italy, Italy's involvement in the Global Road Safety Week, the adaptation of the campaign themes to the findings of the observatory of road behaviour in Argentina, the performance of specific awareness measures relating to mobile phone usage at the wheel in Spain and France, the Safe Pedestrian campaign in Chile, the roll out of actions specifically targeting motorcyclists in Brazil and the awareness scheme in schools in India.
The driving behaviour observatory, a specific study of driver behaviour carried out annually, was conducted in Spain, France, Italy and Puerto Rico, in addition to a global edition of the observatory, and enabled the adaptation of awareness measures and maintenance and operations activities to the practices and conduct associated with the risk of road accidents. A pilot study focused on analysing distractions at the wheel was also conducted in France. As a result of this experiment it was possible to observe how in a journey of 662 km, a driver's attention is diverted on a total of 910 occasions, implying being distracted from the road for 30 minutes or 65 km of the journey.
In addition, road safety forums were set up in Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Italy. These spaces aim to share knowledge and set up alliances with the different stakeholders directly and indirectly involved in the promotion of road safety. Setting up alliances is crucial to managing road safety and achieving the targets established as organizational commitments as well as those of a supra governmental nature established by the main agents at international level. Events of particular note included the extension of the agreement with UNICEF for the performance of activities in relation to the "Rights of Way" project in Brazil, as a result of which a report on "The impact of road traffic accidents with child victims" was prepared in 2019, the Group's involvement through the Abertis Foundation in the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration and adherence to the National Accord for Road Safety in Chile.

The increase in the number of traffic accidents and the decrease in traffic accident fatalities, together with the variation in the number of kilometres travelled has a direct impact on the accident and mortality rates, which are the main indicators used to monitor this material topic. Accordingly, the overall accident rate increased by 1.7%, to 20.2, and the mortality rate decreased by 9.7% in relation to 2018 to 1. The increases observed in the accident rates for Chile and Argentina offset the significant decreases recorded in Puerto Rico, Italy and Spain. In the case of the mortality rate, the overall reduction was diluted by the increases observed in Puerto Rico and Chile.

Guaranteeing occupational health and safety
Individual involvement, the type of tasks performed together with the business activities carried on by the organization impact on the level of importance of occupational health and safety. As a result, the relevance of this material topic has grown gradually and is now identified as being of key importance both within and outside the organization.
All the business activities, except for toll roads in Argentina and India, one of the concession operators in Brazil and another in Puerto Rico (implementation is currently underway in this case), have an occupational health and safety management system in place that complies with legal requirements in force. The concession operators with a certified system conducted internal audits in 2019.

The actions taken are coordinated by the management system, and include, inter alia, a risk assessment of the job position, the definition of the preventive measures required (at functional and training level), the performance of inspections and safety visits, the delivery of training and the performance of drills.
Risk assessments are conducted using proprietary tools in the form of risk matrices or checklists, or by means of standards defined by the legal frameworks in certain countries. In order to formalise these actions, technical analyses of the job positions are conducted, direct observation of the environment and the tasks undertaken is carried out, external factors that may impact on the associated risks are identified and work guidelines are reviewed, among other activities. The risk levels identified range from low to medium or significant, and the highest levels of risk are generally those associated with traffic-related tasks which imply contact with vehicles.
The occupational health and safety committees coordinate periodic monitoring of the actions scheduled in the systems and provide the main collective work space for employees to raise concerns in the area of prevention and occupational risk. 77.5% of the direct headcount and 72.8% of the indirect headcount are covered by the occupational health and safety committees.
One of the concession operators in Puerto Rico held the first occupational health and safety trade fair which was attended by direct and indirect workers. Similarly, the toll road business in Brazil continued to hold the Safety at Work Week in which awareness and training initiatives were strengthened among all the entities working with the organization, including most notably the Occupational Health Round Tables. The toll road business in Chile updated the occupational risk matrices and also held an occupational safety innovation contest, while continuing to hold Safety Month and training sessions and revising the specific rules for entities that work with the organization. A total of 45,692 hours of training were provided in the area of occupational health and safety with important decreases in Brazil, Chile and Italy.

The incident recording systems include technological software that gather data on all the occupational incidents and accidents that occur at substantially all of the concession operators, except in India. These tools enable automation of the management and recording of the related incident investigation proceedings, while ensuring that formalities are initiated in real time. Of particular note in 2019 was the implementation of a new application in the toll road business in Spain to manage and monitor all the actions in relation to the occupational health and safety management system and the joint occupational risk prevention service, including the analysis of accidents and incidents, performance of risk assessments, inspections, observations and audits, as well as monitoring of all preventive actions and any noncompliance.
In accordance with current legislation, the toll road businesses in Spain, Argentina, Brazil and Italy provided occupational health services. These services include regular medical check-ups and in some cases, access to specific wellness services.

The welfare benefits offered by these countries include healthy lifestyle campaigns, medical insurance and vaccination campaigns, and campaigns to raise awareness and prevent certain diseases or illnesses of importance to each local community.
In 2019 a new GRI standard was adopted in relation to occupational health and safety and, accordingly, the accident rate has been broken down into recordable accidents and accidents with days away from work. The total number of recordable accidents during the year amounted to 287, of which a total of 206 resulted in lost working days. 66.9% of the total recordable accidents and 70.4% of total accidents with days away from work involved men. The decrease in the number of accidents with days away from work is significant, down 25.4% on 2018 in global terms, and down 25.3% for men and 25.6% for women. This trend is observed across all countries, except Spain, Chile and Puerto Rico, where the number of accidents with days away from work increased slightly.

The principal causes of occupational accidents include: falls on the same level, manipulation of moving objects, contusions, road traffic accidents, collisions, insect bites and aggressions. In 2019 there were no instances of occupational disease or illness among direct or indirect workers and nor had any been identified at the date of this document. The main factors associated with potential occupational disease or illness include the presence of chemical pollutants, such as fumes produced by combustion engines, incorrect posture and road maintenance work.

The incidence and frequency rates once again followed a downward trend due, on the one hand, to the decrease in the number of accidents and, on the other hand, to the changes in the headcount. Significant decreases were reported for both rates; a 20.5% decrease in the incidence rate and a 23% decrease in the frequency rate in global terms. The trend relating to these two rates was observed in all the countries, except Spain, Chile and Italy. The severity rate was substantially higher as a result of changes that took place in France, Spain, Argentina and Italy.

In 2019 one man (direct employee) died in Chile, another man (indirect worker) died in Argentina and a third man (indirect worker) died in Brazil as a result of two hits by a car and a traffic accident. These figures affect the rate of fatalities and rate of high-consequence work-related injuries, both of which are new indicators introduced for the first time this year, which for Chile were 0.41 in global terms and 0.53 for men. The main factors with an impact on the risk levels associated with fatalities and high-consequence work related injuries are contact with vehicles and contact with traffic in general (collisions and hits by cars).

The recordable accident rate in 2019 was 12 (12.8 for men and 10.9 for women). This indicator compares the total number of recordable accidents with the total number of hours worked and is standardized, in the same way as for the fatality rate and the severity rate, per 1 million hours worked. As this is the first year in which these data are recorded and compiled no historical data are available in this connection.

82.3% of the headcount at December 31st is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is slightly below the figure for 2018. The 41 works councils recorded a slight decrease in activity in 2019 and held a total of 193 meetings. All the countries, except Puerto Rico, have this collective framework in place, although the scope of the framework in each case varies depending on the local context.

The performance assessment mechanisms allow two-way communication channels to be established aimed at ensuring professional development and achieving the objectives defined within a common assessment framework. Now in their third year, the "CRECE" dialogues organized in Spain provide an example of a space for work and reflection for professionals in management positions that focus on building loyalty and retaining talent by means of workshops specially designed to encourage conversation on a range of professional topics between two engaged professionals.

All the countries have a performance-based management assessment framework, which involves 62.1% of the total headcount distributed as follows: 100% executive positions, 96.6% of the heads of department and 59.2% of the remaining headcount, and the percentages are similar for men and women. At corporation level, all the employees are included in a performance-based management programme.

Periodic measurement of employee satisfaction makes it possible to identify areas for improvement with a direct impact on talent retention, professional development and organisational growth. In 2019, the Puerto Rican toll road business conducted an employee satisfaction analysis, the findings of which indicated a level of employee engagement of 90% and earned external recognition for its occupational management and quality employment practices. The toll road business in Brazil also conducted a new survey that indicated a global level of involvement of 84% among the participants. Emovis, in France, obtained a score of 80% in its annual satisfaction questionnaire. In addition to the results, the action proposals generated are incorporated into the action plans to ensure the effectiveness of the continuous improvement systems deployed.

Guaranteeing equal opportunities
The principles of equal opportunities and non-discrimination are embedded in Abertis's Code of Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility policy, and integrated into the different rules and organizational procedures currently in place. The goals forming part of this strategic objective include the achievement of a gender balance and equal pay, nondiscrimination in selection processes and an increase in the number of differently abled employees in the workforce.
In 2019 the distribution of employees remained constant in terms of age group and advances towards a gender balance were achieved in global terms, with 61.8% of the workforce at December 31st being men and 38.2% women. Also, 2019 saw a slight increase in the presence of women in executive and managerial positions to 21.8% of the total executive positions and 27.9% of the total managerial positions.

The variables with the greatest impact on pay differentials are the existence of different collective bargaining frameworks and seniority in the job. The changes that have taken place in the workforce have had an impact on the ratio of women's to men's pay, which has remained constant throughout 2019, at 70.4% overall, 77.3% for management positions, 88.1% for heads and 74.2% for other workers.

The percentage of remuneration at the corporate headquarters remained basically the same with respect to 2018 at 54.7%; however, this value is skewed by the large number of executive positions held by men forming part of the headcount. Equal opportunities legislation differs greatly and varies depending on each country, although all the countries have some type of regulation in place in this connection. The provision for equal opportunities plans in Spain is one example, and another is the obligation to employ a minimum percentage of differently able employees in force in Brazil, France, Spain and Chile.

Training groups that are underrepresented in each of the job positions and adapting working hours to achieve a work-life balance are just two examples of the initiatives adopted that focus on achieving a gender balance across all the professional categories.
The introduction of a local minimum wage in current legislation is a practice shared by all the countries except Italy. In general, the local minimum wage increased in 2019, and the ratio of the entry level wage to the local minimum wage was reduced in certain countries. Despite this, there were no significant changes in relation to this indicator compared to 2018.

Parental leave enables employees to balance their work and family lives, particularly if they have minors in their care. A total of 229 individuals took parental leave in 2019, 76.9% of whom were women. The global retention rate was 94.3% for men and 73.3% for women, although the distribution across the countries is not uniform.

The equivalent average headcount of differently abled employees increased by 22.5% compared to 2018, to a total of 382.3 individuals. The main changes arose in Brazil, Spain and Chile. It should be noted that Brazil, France, Spain and Chile have minimum hiring quotas in place for this group, either by means of direct employment or through the application of alternative measures such as purchasing and arranging goods and services from and donations to special employment centres and occupational placement companies.

Quality products and services with positive social impacts
Establishing management systems designed to achieve continuous improvement both in road safety and service quality enables the systematization of the improvement actions taken. 61.9% of the organization's revenue has a quality management system in place in accordance with ISO 9001, and 52.4% of revenue has system certification.

Continuous communication and the availability of real time communication channels are an important aspect of the quality of the service provided. The incorporation of a voice assistant by radio Sanef 107.7 in France to request real time traffic information, the development of a digital strategy in Puerto Rico, the design and launch of a specific website for ongoing communication of any roadworks being carried out on toll roads in Argentina, the promotion of local tourist destinations through digital platforms in Puerto Rico and Italy, and the deployment of Wi-Fi networks in Brazil to improve communication channels in emergency situations, are some examples of the actions taken during the year.
Management of queries, complaints and suggestions facilitates identification of areas for improvement and makes it possible to fulfil the expectations of road users and the organization's customers. The toll road businesses in France and Puerto Rico, one of the subsidiaries in Italy and Emovis France conducted customer and user satisfaction surveys with results that were consistent with the earlier findings.

In 2019 a total of 740 road safety campaigns were carried out in all the countries, more than half of which were performed in Brazil, as described in the road safety section of this strategic axis. Knowledge transfer between countries and observation of driving behaviour world wide enable campaigns to be adapted to ensure that they focus on the aspects of driving behaviour most closely related to traffic accidents.
The inclusion of environmental and social considerations in Research and Development projects (R&D) will make it possible to include any positive and negative impacts of an environmental or social nature at the outset of the design and creation phases of new products and services. In 2018 and 2019 a total of 53 R&D projects had been initiated with an average length of between 1 and 5 years. 47.2% of the projects underway are of an internal nature, 34% correspond to industrial cooperation projects and 18.9% are Spanish or European projects. The main areas of innovation include cooperative intelligent transport systems, digital transformation, tolling and methods of payment, infrastructure, energy and the electricity transformation. It should be noted that 75% of the completed projects are to be used to generate market-ready or tested solutions, just under 10% are for the creation of a prototype and approximately 15% are feasibility studies or preliminary research. The INFRAMIX project, in relation to the roll out of autonomous vehicles in Spain, and the DATA CITY project involving the study of improvements for future mobility management and commuting into cities, are two examples of projects in progress in 2019.

Methodologies and International Equivalences

Preparation methodology

Standards and principles

For the first time, the Appendix on Follow-up of the CSR Master Plan for 2019 is presented together with the Directors' Report to the Financial Statements. This document, together with the Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) and the other corporate publications (which include most notably the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire for its 2019 edition) completes the information relating to economic, financial, environmental, social and good governance performance for 2019.

This appendix extends and elaborates on the environmental, social and good governance (ESG) information summarised in the Directors' Report to the Financial Statements, which was treated, gathered and prepared in accordance with the requirements contained in the reference international standards:

 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) of 2016 (except the standard on occupational health and safety and the standard on water and effluents which date from 2018) in accordance with the standards (comprehensive option).

 Policy for preparation of the UN Global Compact Communication of Progress (CoP).

 Accountability Stakeholder Engagement principles.

 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition to the foregoing standards, other technical and methodological measurement frames of reference were considered, as detailed below, together with the recommendations of external measurement bodies on environmental, social and good governance (ESG) matters. These considerations satisfy in full the requirements established in the NonFinancial Information Law in force in Spain since 2018, together with other procedural matters, including the external verification of the non-financial information and its publication at the same time and in the same form as the organization's financial statements.

The various procedures and mechanisms for the management and preparation of the financial statements aim to respond to the principles for defining report content and ensuring report quality addressed in the GRI Foundation Standard (SRS 101), and cover both systems for the management of issues with significant social, environmental and good governance impacts and also specific technological tools for the compilation of non-financial information.

B. GENERAL MEETING OR EQUIVALENT BODY
B.1. List the quorums for convening the General Meeting or equivalent body established in the bylaws. Describe how these differ from the system of minimum quorums established in the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law (LSC) or in the applicable legislation.
During this year 2019, the Company's bylaws have not been modified. As mentioned on the previous year, they have increased th e quorums established in Articles 193 and 194 of the LSC.
Article 17 of the Company's bylaws establishes that the General Meeting, whether annual or extraordinary, is deemed to be validly convened at first call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least eighty per cent (80%) of the subscribed sha re capital with voting rights plus two (2) shares.
The General Meeting is deemed to be validly convened at second call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least fifty per cent (50%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights. urante este ejercicio 2019, no se han modificado los Estatutos Sociales de la Sociedad.
The quorums for convening the General Meeting indicated in article 17 of the Bylaws shall be applicable regardless of the matters to be dealt with in the Meeting.
Article 193 of the LSC establishes that the General Meeting of a public limited liability company is deemed to be validly convened at first call when the shareholders attending in person or by proxy hold at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights, and that it is deemed to be validly convened at second call regardless of the capital of the attendees.
Article 194 of the LSC establishes the qualified quorum for convening the General Meeting in special cases, such as capital increases or reductions and any amendments to the Company bylaws, issues of debt instruments, the removal or limitation of new share pre-emption rights, etc., which will require at first call the attendance of shareholders in person or by proxy holding at least fifty per cent (50%) of the subscribed share capital with voting rights, and at second call at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of such capital.
B.2. Explain the system for adopting corporate resolutions. Describe how this differs from the system established in the LSC or in the applicable legislation.
Article 18 of the Company bylaws establishes that the resolutions are adopted by an absolute majority of the shares attending the General Meeting in person or by proxy, with one vote per share, except for the resolutions that must be approved by a greater majority in accordance with the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law.
As an exception, the approval of resolutions relating to the following matters ("Reserved Matters"), when they must be submitted for the approval of the Company's General Meeting, require, in any case, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five per cent (65%) plus one (1) share of the subscribed share capital with voting rights. The aforementioned Reserved Matters are the following:
(i) amendment of the bylaws, including, but not limited to, any amendment of the structure of the managing body or of the number of members thereof, or any increase, reduction, variation or other change in the share capital
(ii) the issuance of any security, equity instrument or equity-related instrument, or of any other synthetic security or instrument (such as, among others, convertible debentures);
(iii) any merger, spin-off, segregation, transfer of assets and liabilities, international relocation of registered office or any other structural changes, except when such transactions only affect the Company and wholly-owned investees;
(iv) a request for admission to listing, the launch of a public offering or the subscription of all or a portion of the shares of the Company or of a controlled company;
(v) the distribution of dividends and/or reserves, when not performed at all times in line with the dividends policy approved by the Company's Board of Directors, and the approval of the amendment of the Company's dividends policy;
(vi) any M&A transaction (i.e. acquisitions, sales or capital investments in assets or investments in projects) the amount of which, in aggregate terms for an annual period, exceeds eighty million euros (EUR 80,000,000);
(vii) the approval or amendment of the financial or dividends policy of the Company and its Group; and
(viii) any related-party transaction.
Article 201 of the LSC establishes that the corporate resolutions of public limited liability companies are adopted by means of a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending the General Meeting in person or by proxy. In this case, the majority required by Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is an absolute majority, while that established by the LSC is a simple majority.
Also, Article 201 of the LSC establishes that, for the resolutions referred to in Article 194 of the LSC (qualified quorum for convening the General Meeting in special cases described in the preceding section), if the capital attending or represented by proxy exceeds fifty per cent (50%), the resolution may be adopted by means of an absolute majority. However, the affirmative vote of two thirds of the share capital present in person or by proxy at the General Meeting is required when at second call there are shareholders in attendance representing twenty -five per cent (25%) or more, but less than fifty per cent (50%), of the subscribed share capital with voting rights.

Yes
No Partial policies

If "yes", describe this diversity policy, its objectives, the related measures, the manner in which it has been applied and the outcome of its implementation in the year. Also, the specific measures adopted by the managing body and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee to achieve a balanced and diverse presence of directors must be indicated.
The director selection and appointment policy approved by the Board of Directors on 15 December 2015 provides that the select ion of candidates as directors shall be based on a prior analysis of the Company's needs, which must be conducted by the Board of Directors with the assistance of and a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, if such a committee exists, with a view to including different professional and management experience and competencies, and promoting diversity of knowledge, experience and gender, considering the weighting of the various activities conducted by Abertis, and taking into account areas or sectors that require specific development.
During the year 2019, the director Mr. Giovanni Castellucci presented his resignation and on September 25, 2019, Mr. Fabio Cerchiai was appointed instead, taking into account said diversity policy. We briefly summarize his professional profile:

D.4. Give details of the mechanisms in place for detecting, identifying and resolving any potential conflicts of interest between the entity or its group and its directors, members of the managing body or executives.
The Regulations of the Board of Directors contain in its article 28 and following specific obligations derived from the duty of loyalty and information on interests in the Company itself or from interests in other companies outside the Group, of the members of the Board. In particular, the duty of loyalty obliges the members of the Board of Directors to take the necessary measures to avoid incurring situations in which their interests, on their own or another's account, may conflict with the social interest and with their duties to with the Company excepting the cases in which the Company has authorized the operation with which there is a conflict.
The Directors must notify to the other Directors and, where appropriate, to the Board of Directors of any conflict situation, direct or indirect, that they or persons linked to them may have in the interest of the Company. The affected director shall refrain from intervening in the agreements or decisions regarding the operation to which the conflict refers and his vote shall be deducted for calculating the majority of votes that may be necessary.
In accordance with the Board Regulations, the duty to avoid situations of conflict of interest obliges the director to refrain from carrying out transactions with the company, except in the case of ordinary operations, carried out under standard conditions for clients and of little relevance, understood as those whose information is not necessary to express the faithful image of the assets, the financial situation and the results of the Company. The Director must refrain from using the name of the company or invoke his status as Director to unduly influence the performance of private operations, as well as to make use of social acts, including confidential company information for private purposes and to take advantage of the business opportunities of the company and of obtaining advantages or remuneration from third parties other than the company and its group, associated with the performance of its position, unless it is mere courtesy. The Director must also refrain from carrying out activities on his or her own account or on behalf of others that involve effective competition, whether current or potential, with the Company or that, in any other way, place him in a permanent conflict with the interests of the Company.
The provisions described in this section shall also apply in the event that the beneficiary of the prohibited acts or activities is a person linked to the Director
Situations of conflicts of interest are reported in the annual accounts report.
The Company may waive the situations of conflicts of interest are reported in the annual accounts reports described above in singular cases, authorizing the performance by a Director or a related person of a certain transaction with the Company, the use of certain s ocial assets, taking advantage of a specific business opportunity, obtaining an advantage or remuneration from a third party.
When the object of the authorization is the waiver of the prohibition of obtaining an advantage or the remuneration of third parties or when the dispensation affects a transaction whose value is greater than ten percent (10%) of the social assets, the authorization must be necessarily agreed by the General Meeting.
In other cases, the Board of Directors may also grant the authorization, if the independence of the members that grant it to the dispensed director is guaranteed. In addition, it will be necessary to ensure the safety of the authorized operation for the social her itage or, where appropriate, its performance under market conditions and the transparency of the process
CONTINUE IN SECTION G.1
E. RISK CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
14

E.1. Explain the scope of the entity's Risk Control and Management System
The Board of Directors of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. is allocated the task of preparing the risk strategy, entrusting this function to the Audit and Control Committee, which establishes the Risk Control and Management Policy of the Abertis Group and supervises the risk management system and its commitment to the application of the tax best practices.
The Abertis Group implements a risk management model, approved and monitored by the Audit and Control Committee, and applicable to all the business and corporate units in all the countries where the Group carries on its activities. The risk management model covers all the Group's possible risks with the aim of ensuring achievement of the Group's main objectives.
Based on the directives defined by the Corporate Risk Control unit, each of the business and corporate units is responsible for preparing and maintaining its risk map which includes identification and assessment of the inherent and residual risks, of the control initiatives and activities implemented, those in charge thereof, and of the action plans defined to cover the residual risks.
The risk maps are checked and approved by the general managers of the business unit or by the managers of the corporate areas. The aforementioned risk maps are subject to periodic review by the Audit and Control Committee and the Management Committee which also monitor the main risks more frequently.
E.2. Identify the entity's bodies in charge of preparing and executing the Risk Control and Management System
The members of the managing bodies undertake to ensure that the Group's significant risks are duly and acceptably identified, measured, prioritised and controlled, and to establish the basic mechanisms and policies required to achieve a level of risk that enables:
 The creation of value for shareholders.
 Protection of the Group's reputation, fostering of good Corporate Governance practices and commitment through the application of tax best practices.
 Provision of a quality service in all the Group-operated infrastructures.
The bodies responsible for definition, execution and oversight are as follows:
Board of Directors: retains ultimate responsibility for the definition of the risk strategy and of the risk control policy.
Audit and Control Committee: is responsible for supervision of the risk control systems, including approval of the model and periodic monitoring of the risks with varying frequencies based on the criticality and significance thereof.
Corporate Risk Control: is responsible for the preparation and update of the risk management policies, ensuring effective implementation of the model, establishing a common methodology for the identification, classification and assessment of risks, coordinating the update of the risk maps, implementing a monitoring and reporting system for the governing bodies and, in cooperation with the other areas of the Group, reviewing the control activities that mitigate the identified risks and monitoring of the action plans.
Business/corporate unit General Managers: are in charge of risk management in their respective areas of responsibility which includes the implementation of the risk policies defined, validation of the risk maps, and supervision of the implementation of control activities and action plans to mitigate risks.
Business/corporate unit risk coordinators: are responsible for coordinating implementation of each unit or area's risk management model which includes the identification and assessment thereof, as well as the implementation of a system for the control, monitoring and reporting of emerging risks to the Corporate Risk Control Unit. The risk coordinator, together with those in charge of each area, periodically prepares the risk updates and the detail of control activities, as well as information on the status of action plans.
Function supervisors: are those responsible for identifying risks in their respective areas and notifying their unit risk coordinator appropriately. They are also responsible for the identification and implementation of the control activities aimed at mitigating risks.
The responsibilities defined in the foregoing section are detailed in the "Framework Risk Management Policy" approved by the Board of Directors at the proposal of the Audit and Control Committee.
E.3. Indicate the main risks that might affect the achievement of the business objectives.
The business objectives may be adversely affected by the following main risks:
· Business environment-related risks inherent to economic performance, arising from decreased demand in certain countries, amended to legislation (tax, legal and environmental), socio-political change, or adverse weather conditions.
· Specific risks arising as a result of the Group's business activities such as the maturity and term of concessions, agree ments with public authorities, the performance of transactions on regulated markets, fulfilment of concession obligations and investment commitments and the entry into service of alternative infrastructures.
· Financial risks inherent to growth operations and investment financing processes, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, rating control and refinancing needs.
· Operating risks relating to user and personnel safety, adaptation and swift response to technological changes in operating systems, control of construction projects, infrastructure maintenance, the security, integrity and confidentiality of financial and corporate information and
15

business know-how, personnel selection and performance , training and retention of talent, fraud, supplier dependence and business interruption.
16

E.4. Identify whether the entity has risk tolerance levels.
To determine tolerance levels Abertis has taken three aspects of the corporation as a reference: · Mission, vision and values. · Abertis corporate strategy. · Criticality risk analysis by categories. Tolerance levels are defined in the risk assessment matrix which provides the basis for the assessment of the inherent and re sidual risks. Various scales of possible impacts are established taking into consideration economic and reputational criteria, or obligations relating to liability. Given the impact their possible materialisation might have on the achievement of objectives, specific tolerance levels are defined for the risks considered to be critical, indicating action guidelines, deadlines for achievement, the persons responsible and monitoring indicators, in addition to setting out the frequency and content of the information to be furnished to the governing bodies for monitoring and decision-making purposes.
A system of alerts has been set up for the remaining risks to ensure identification of material changes in measurement or sig nificant control weaknesses outside the approved tolerance levels for the related risks.
E.5. Identify whether the entity has risk tolerance levels.
The risks identified in the risk maps of the various business or corporate units are, in the main, risks inherent to the business model and to the various activities carried on by the Abertis Group. Accordingly, to a certain extent the risks could arise in the course of each financial year.
The most significant risks to materialise in the current year were as follows:
 Political and social instability in certain countries in which the Group operates has given rise to uncertainty as to the potential impact on the performance of the Group's activities; however, swift decision-making and the internationalisation and geographical diversification of the businesses has ensured that there was no significant impact on the Group.
 The ongoing restrictions on the availability and terms and conditions of public and private funding pose a risk in terms of the Group's growth strategy (financing of new growth transactions and investment commitments), but have been mitigated thanks to the Group's strict financial discipline with guidelines and limits defined by the governing bodies and comprehensive monitoring of the entire organisation .
 The relevant maturities of some of the highway concessions in the short and medium term, mitigated by the growth of the portfolio of assets resulting from the agreement for the acquisition of the 50,12% stake in the Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO) group in Mexico.
E.6. Identify whether the entity has risk tolerance levels.
The risk management model implemented by the Abertis Group sets out the level of oversight and the performance of specific initiatives or response plans for the main risks based on the assessment or the level of criticality thereof in order to ensure that risks are contained within the defined limits. A group of risks for priority monitoring is defined (at least each quarter) and the risks selected are reviewed by the Audit and Control Committee.
The response plans for the priority-monitoring risk group form part of the implementation of the specific initiatives for each of the aforementioned risks and include:
 Main milestones to be achieved  Persons responsible for implementation and monitoring within the organisation  Monitoring indicators  Content and frequency of the information to be furnished to governing bodies to ensure prompt decision-making.
Risks of a strategic and business nature due to the economic environment, regulatory changes and the specific nature of the concession business are monitored by the management committees whereas financial and operating risks are, in the main, monitored by the corporate committees in coordination with the related committees of the various business units (security committees, operating committees, technical committees, etc.).
Response plans vary based on each risk type and address issues such as:
 The internationalisation and geographical diversification strategy due to the economic downturn in certain countries and periods, offset by increased demand in response to growth in other countries. In 2019, Abertis has continued to strengthen its international presence due to the agreement for the acquisition of the 50,12% participation of the Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO) group in Mexico.
 Cost optimisation based on the definition, implementation and monitoring of the efficiency plans, which place special emphasis on optimising the operating costs and controlling the operating investments of all the business units within the Abertis Group.
 Dialogue with the parties involved in order to provide tailor-made solutions in the infrastructure industry, adapted to each country, and negotiations with public authorities, occasionally agreeing on specific investment commitments.
 Definition of policies and procedures for the most important risks in order to control risk performance within the defined limits.  Adhesion to the Code of Good Tax Practices with the aim of enhancing Abertis Group companies' corporate responsibility in addition to bringing
greater stability to its economic results and greater legal certainty. The Abertis Group implemented the content of the Code of Good Tax Practices effectively.  The maintenance of an appropriate insurance policy that guarantees coverage of the main types of damage, particularly catastrophes.

The System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) of the Abertis Group ("the Group" or "Abertis") forms part of its general internal control system and consists of a set of processes performed by the Board of Directors, the Audit and Control Committee (ACC), senior executives and Group personnel, in order to provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of the financial information disseminated in the markets. The "Policy for the Definition of Responsibilities for the System of Internal Control over the Financial Reporting of the Abertis Group" establishes the following lines of responsibility and authority in relation to the ICFR system:
 Abertis' Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for all the regulated information the Group disseminates and, accordingly, for preparing the financial reporting (Article 4 of the Board Regulations) and ensuring that its ICFR system is adequate and effective.
 In accordance with the bylaws and the Board Regulations, the main responsibilities of the ACC include, inter alia:
o Overseeing and analysing, prior to submission to the Board, the Group's statutory financial reporting process, reviewing correct compliance with the legislation in force and application of the accounting principles.
o Overseeing the effectiveness and sufficiency of the Group's system of internal control and risk assessment, with the aim that any risk (operating, financial, technological, legal or reputational) with a significant impact on the Group's financial reporting may be identified, managed and mitigated, and communicated to the Board of Directors.
o Overseeing the independence of the External Auditor, supervising its work.
o Overseeing the work performed by the Corporate Risk Control and Internal Audit Department, ensuring its independence and verifying that the recommendations and corrective measures it makes are considered by management.
 The Corporate Management Control and Planning Department (reporting to General Financial Management) is responsible for the design, maintenance and implementation of the ICFR system.
Abertis' Internal Audit function assumes the oversight of the ICFR system delegated by the ACC.
F.1.2 Indicate the following, if in place, particularly in connection with the financial reporting process:
 The departments and/or mechanisms in charge of: (i) the design and review of the organisational structure; (ii) defining clear lines of responsibility and authority, with an appropriate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) ensuring procedures are in place to communicate this structure effectively throughout the entity:
Abertis' Board of Directors assigns responsibility for the design and review of the organisational structure to the Compensat ion and Organisation Department of the People and Organisation Area. This department define the general outline of the organisational structure, the distribution of responsibilities and the hierarchy of the job positions, as well as related legislation. The result of th ese mechanisms is documented in the form of organisational charts (organisational structure), the manuals of functions and job position descriptions (establishing allocation, distribution and segregation of functions) and maps of job position assessments (establishing the levels of responsibility).
The Group has an internal organisational chart that is found on the corporate intranet. It covers all the areas, locations and companies belonging to the Group and is basically organised by line of business and department (including those departments involved in the preparation, analysis and oversight of financial reporting). The organisational chart indicates responsibilities up to a certain management level and is supplemented with other more detailed organisational charts provided at department level.
With respect to the financial reporting process, in addition to the detailed organisational charts, manuals, internal policies and instructions are issued by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department (included in the Group's unified reporting manual), which establish the specific guidelines and responsibilities at each reporting date (close procedures defining the main tasks both at corporate and subsidiary level), including most notably:
· "Group Reporting and Accounting Policies Handbook" (GRAPH): this handbook encompasses the accounting policies used by the Group to prepare its financial statements and its aim is to obtain consistent, uniform and comparable financial information for all the Group companies.
· "Close instructions": published every six months, establish the schedule to be followed by the Group companies when submitting the financial reporting and other procedures to be applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated information.
· "Policy for Accounting Close at Subsidiaries": establishes the procedures to be followed to prepare the economic and financial information of the Group subsidiaries and the associated oversight procedures
18

 Code of conduct, approving body, dissemination and instruction, principles and values covered (stating whether it makes specific reference to record keeping and financial reporting), body in charge of investigating breaches and proposing corrective or disciplinary action:
Abertis has a Code of Conduct (Code of Ethics), approved by the Board of Directors which is adapted by each business unit, through the preparation of a Local Code of Ethics, when required by the national laws, customs and practices of the country where the bus iness unit operates. In any event, the Local Codes of Ethics must follow the guidelines of the Group's Code of Ethics. Also, the Abertis business units with head offices in Spain are subject to the Code of Ethics Regulations in Spain which regulate and prohibit any conduct that could imply criminal liability for legal entities.
Training is provided for new employees, and all employees are required to accept Abertis' Code of Ethics each year. Training is available on the company intranet and the Abertis website.
The core values and principles enshrined in the Code of Ethics are as follows: integrity, honesty, transparency, legal compliance, avoidance of conflicts of interest, treatment of information with the maximum strictness, appropriate use and protection of company assets, the guarantee of equal opportunities, non-discrimination of people and no reprisals against reports in good faith of breaches of the Group's Code of Ethics and its Local Codes of Ethics. Also the Code of Ethics provides that treatment of information must be truthful, so that the Group's economic and financial information reflects fairly its economic, financial and equity position, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable international financial reporting standards.
The bodies in charge of investigating breaches and proposing corrective or disciplinary action are the Abertis Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees and its Compliance functions. All the Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees are presided over by the relevant Local Compliance Officer, in cooperation with the Chief Compliance Officer. The Group's Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for reporting to the Abertis ACC about all the instances of non-compliance detected either by the Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees or by the Group's Compliance functions. Also, these bodies have the cooperation of the Group's various management areas, including the Management Control Department of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A., for monitoring compliance with its internal policies. This operating mechanism is described in the Group's Compliance Policy, published on the company intranet and the Abertis website, as well as in the Group's policies.
 Whistle-blowing channel, for reporting any irregularities of a financial or accounting nature, as well as breaches of the code of conduct and irregular activities within the organisation to the Audit Committee, stating, as applicable, whether such reports are confidential:
The whistle-blowing channel is managed by the Group's Ethical and Crime Prevention Committees and facilitates the reporting of any irregularities of a financial, accounting or non-financial nature.
As established in the whistle-blowing channel procedure, breaches may be reported using an online form (available on the company intranet and on the Abertis website), by post or by email. Also, all Group rules establish the requirement to report any breach of the rules to the Chief Compliance Officer of Abertis. The ACC periodically monitors the reports of breaches and of how they are handled and resolved, as well as the detection of risks of non-compliance detected by the Group's corresponding Compliance functions.
 Training and periodic refresher courses for personnel involved in preparing and reviewing financial information or evaluating the system of ICFR, which address, at least, accounting rules, auditing, internal control and risk management:
As regards training and periodic refresher courses, Abertis considers the development and ongoing training of its employees and executives, both at corporate and subsidiary level, in those issues affecting the preparation of the Abertis Group's consolidated financial information to be of crucial importance.
Abertis has a Training Plan for all of its employees, prepared by the Human Resources Department. The actions included in the Plan are linked to the Group's strategic objectives, as well as the Human Resources Department's strategy.
Abertis also considers that comprehensive, up-to-date training in relation to accounting rules and standards for preparing financial reporting, and capital market, tax and internal control regulations is necessary to ensure that the information reported to the markets is reliable and complies with current legislation.
With respect to the preparation and review of financial information, each year Abertis provides training in those areas identified by the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department in relation to:
· New regulations adopted (accounting, tax, capital markets and internal control) and applicable to the Group. · Changes in the reporting methodology and/or in the IT systems. · Individual initiative of team members of the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department.
Once the training requirements in the aforementioned areas have been identified, appropriate training activities are designed and carried out to fulfil the Group's annual training objectives in these areas.
In 2019 Abertis provided training activities by external experts and in-house training sessions for the personnel involved in the preparation and review of the financial reporting at corporate and subsidiary level. Training in 2019 was focused mainly on the accounting, tax and financial areas that may have the greatest impact on the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial reporting, in particular, in relation to IT systems, changes in tax legislation and latest developments adopted during the year in accordance with the EU-IFRSs
In addition, in 2019 specific training was provided in the following areas:
19

· Accounting training on "New accounting standards on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), first application of IFRS IFRS16) given by the Consolidation and Accounting Regulations Department.
· Tax courses given by the Corporate Tax Department, in particular, on the latest tax developments in 2019 in the main countries in which Abertis has a presence and international taxation.
· Courses given by the Compliance Department, specifically: o On-line training on the misuse of information for management personnel o Face-to-face and online training in relation to the Abertis Group's compliance model (model of criminal prevention, prevention of corruption, advocacy lobby, conflicts of interest ...)
· Legal alerts prepared by the Legal Advisory Department on the latest amendments to legislation applicable to Group companies.
The Corporate Management Control and Planning Department has subscriptions to a number of publications and journals on accounting and financial matters and to the website of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which regularly sends new developments and other communications of interest which are analysed to ensure they are taken into consideration when preparing Abertis' financial information.
F.2. Assessment of financial reporting risks
Provide information on, at least:
F.2.1 The main features of the risk identification process, including risks of error or fraud, as regards :
 Whether the process exists and is documented:
Pursuant to the provisions of Legislative Royal Decree 4/2015, of 23 October, approving the Consolidated Securities Market La w and Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) Circular no. 7/2015, of 22 December, the Group has a system of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) model).
The aforementioned model is documented in the "Policy for identification of risk of error in financial reporting of the Abert is Group" ("Risk Identification Policy"), which describes the process for identifying risks of material error or fraud in relation to the consolidated financial statements. The risk identification process is performed at least once a year.
Through application of the Risk Identification Policy, Abertis ensures that the risk identification process considers quantitative and qualitative variables (i.e. transaction complexity, risk of fraud, regulatory compliance or level of judgement required) when defining the scope of the Group's ICFR system.
As a result of applying the Risk Identification Policy, an ICFR risk matrix is drawn up for the consolidated group. The purpose of the mat rix is to identify the accounts and disclosures which have an associated significant risk with a potential material impact on financial reporting. Once the scope of application of the Group's ICFR system has been defined, based on the identified risk matrix, the control activities required to mitigate the identified risks are designed.
The process of identifying risks of error in financial reporting is performed and documented each year by the General Financial Department (through the Consolidation and Accounting Regulations Management) and the General Directorate of Planning and Control.
 Whether the process covers all financial reporting objectives (existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; presentation, disclosure and comparability; and rights and obligations), is updated and how frequently:
The Risk Identification Policy establishes that, following identification, risks are reviewed in order to analyse the potential risks of error in each of the financial reporting elements (existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; presentation, disclosure and comparability; and rights and obligations) that might have a significant impact on the reliability of the financial reporting.
The risks of error identified in the financial reporting are classified as follows: a) General risks b) Risks relating to appropriate recognition of the Group's specific transactions
a. Significant transactions b. Judgements and estimates c. Lack of familiarity with agreements/contracts d. Activities outsourced to third parties c) Risks relating to the financial reporting preparation process d) Risks relating to IT systems
Each of the aforementioned risks identified in the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements is associated with the processes and various financial areas deemed significant (in view of either their contribution to the consolidated financial statements or to other more qualitative factors) and to the Group companies within the scope of the ICFR system
 Whether a specific process is in place to define the scope of consolidation, taking into account, inter alia, the possible existence of complex corporate structures, holding companies and special purpose vehicles:
20

The identification of the scope of consolidation is performed periodically to obtain an updated company map. Companies exercising direct or indirect control (power to govern the operating and financial policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities) are considered when establishing the companies within the scope of the ICFR system. Therefore, the scope of the ICFR system excludes companies over which joint or significant influence is exercised, although general controls are performed in order to provide assurance on the reliability of the financial reporting furnished by these companies and included in the consolidated financial statements.
 Whether the process addresses other types of risk (operational, technological, financial, legal, reputational, environmental, etc.) insofar as they may affect the financial statements:
Abertis considers the possibility of risks of error arising in certain processes not associated with specific types of transactions to the extent that they may impact the financial statements (such as the close process, the IT system operating process and the judgements or key accounting policies review process). These processes include the consolidation process and, accordingly, the Group has established policies geared towards ensuring both correct configuration and execution of the process, as well as correct identification of the scope of consolidation.
 Indicate the entity's governing body that oversees the process:
As mentioned above in F.1.1., the ACC is responsible for oversight of the internal control and risk management system with the support of the Internal Audit function.
F.3. Control activities
Provide information, indicating the salient features, if available, on at least:
F.3.1 Procedures for reviewing and authorising financial information and the description of the ICFR system to be disseminated in the securities markets, indicating the persons responsible in that connection, as well as documentation describing the flows of activities and controls (including those addressing the risk of fraud) for the various types of transactions that may have a material effect on the financial statements, including the accounting close procedure and the specific review of the relevant judgements, estimates, valuations and projections
The Group's "Review, Authorisation and Supervision of Financial Reporting Policy" establishes, inter alia, the scope (periodic regulated financial reporting and those responsible for the preparation thereof) and the review procedures of the ACC, which include reading and analysis of the information and discussions with those responsible for its preparation (Corporate Management Control and Planning Department), those responsible for the verification of the design of the model and operation of the existing controls (Internal Audit) and the external auditors.
Responsibility in relation to the preparation of the financial information at each quarterly close begins with the review and certification of the person responsible for economic and financial matters at each subsidiary, and also, at the half-yearly and annual accounting closes, with the express certification of the general manager of each subsidiary. The aforementioned certification is provided by means of a questionnaire that includes the internal control procedures that must be performed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the entity's financial statements.
As regards the description of the ICFR system contained in this document, the review and certification process is the same as that applied for
the rest of the economic and financial content of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
The separate and consolidated financial statements, the half-yearly financial reports and the financial information contained in the Group's quarterly interim management statements are prepared and reviewed by the General Financial Management and Planning and Control Department and the Financial Department prior to submission to the ACC. The ACC applies the procedures included in the policy referred to
at the beginning of the section as a preliminary step towards the submission of its conclusions to the Board of Directors of Abertis.
The documentation of the ICFR system includes the following documents: · ICFR system policies · Corporate internal regulations · ICFR system risk map · ICFR system scope model · ICFR system risk and control matrix · Quarterly questionnaires certifying control activities
In addition to the ICFR system policies, Abertis has policies designed to mitigate the risks of error in processes not associated with specific transactions. Specifically, documented corporate internal regulations exist in relation to: · Accounting close procedures (at both corporate level, including the consolidation process, and at subsidiary level) · Procedures relating to activities performed by third parties · Transfer pricing · Policies to identify and establish levels of approval for significant judgements and estimates
In addition to the risks detected and documented in the "ICFR system risk and control matrix", the scope of the system of internal control over financial reporting is established in order to determine both the headings affected in the financial statements, as well as the companies affected (see section F.2.1.).
21

In relation to the activities and controls directly related to transactions that may materially affect the financial statements, the Group has descriptions of the controls implemented to mitigate the risk of material error in the information reported to the markets. The descriptions are also documented in the "ICFR system risk and control matrix" and contain information on what the control activity should entail, why it is executed, who is required to execute it and how often, as well as any other information with regard to which IT systems or wh ich activities performed by third parties are relevant in terms of the effectiveness of the related control activity. The controls cover areas such as the generation of revenue, investments and concession expenses, acquisitions and subsequent measurement of other non-current assets, analysis of investment recovery, recognition of income taxes or correct presentation of financial instruments and of financing transactions of the Group. Abertis performs an annual review of matrices to ensure maintenance thereof.
The Group has descriptive corporate documentation available on the control activities that encompass all the financial reporting control objectives of the various types of transactions with a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In relation to relevant judgements and estimates, the Group provides information in its annual consolidated financial statements on particularly relevant areas of uncertainty. The specific review and approval of the significant judgements, estimates, valuations and projections, as well as the key assumptions used for their calculation, with a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, is carried out by General Financial Management and, where applicable, by the chief executive officer. The most significant, such as the monitoring of asset value, hedging policies, etc. are discussed and reviewed by the ACC, prior to their approval by the Board of Directors.

F.3.2 Internal control policies and procedures for IT systems (including secure access, tracking of changes, system operation, operational continuity and segregation of duties) giving support to key company processes regarding the preparation and publication of financial information.
The Group uses IT systems to maintain proper recognition and control of its transactions and, therefore, their correct functioning is a crucial element of particular importance to the Group. Specifically, it has implemented standardised accounting and reporting systems at the majority of the Group companies.

Accordingly, as part of the identification process for risks of error in financial reporting, the Group identifies, through its Corporate Management Control and Planning Department, which systems and applications are relevant to the preparation of the financial reporting. The systems and applications identified include those used directly at corporate level in the preparation of the consolidated financial reporting, as well as the reporting systems among the various Group companies. The systems and applications include, inter alia, both complex developments at integrated IT system level, as well as other software applications developed at user level (e.g. spreadsheets), when they are relevant to the activities involved in the preparation and control of financial reporting.

Also, the Systems Department has established general policies aimed at ensuring the correct operation of the systems and applications. These policies cover both physical and logical security relating to access, procedures to verify the design of new systems or changes to existing systems and data recovery policies in the event of unforeseen incidents affecting the operation thereof. In particular, documented policies exist in relation to the following:

·

IT system project development methodology (change management, etc.)

·

Operations management (backup management, patch installation, system capacity and performance management, communications management,

interface monitoring, operational incident management and resolution, preventive updates and batch process management)

·

Information and systems security (backup copy procedure and plan, user and licence management, physical access, security monitoring, etc.)

·

Systems continuity plan

The Systems Department performs an annual validation of the effectiveness of the controls established over the various IT systems implemented at the Group.

F.3.3 Internal control policies and procedures for overseeing the management of activities outsourced to third parties and of the appraisal, calculation or valuation services commissioned from independent experts, when these may materially affect the financial statements.
Since 2015, some of the Group companies in Spain have outsourced to a third-party provider certain of the activities associated with economic and personnel management. In this connection, certain risk control and management mechanisms have been established with the provider to ensure the completeness and reliability of the financial information arising from the outsourced activities, including, inter alia: a Management and Oversight Committee for the agreement, service level agreements, risk indicators, service reports, technological security measures, external audits and contingency and continuity plans.

Also, the Group uses, on a recurring basis, independent experts' reports to measure its financial instruments and employee benefit obligations.

The Corporate Finance Department and Compensation and Benefits Department carry out checks prior to hiring independent experts and following the experts' work, in order to verify:

·

Competence, knowledge, credentials and independence;

·

The validity of the data and methods used; and

·

The reasonableness of the assumptions applied, where applicable.

Abertis has documented guidelines on the treatment of activities outsourced to third parties in terms of both engagement and results. These guidelines are set out in the "Procedure for activities performed by third parties" policy. Each year the Group reviews which activities performed by third parties are relevant to the preparation of the financial reporting.

22

F.4. Reporting and communication.

Provide information, indicating the salient features, if available, on at least:
F.4.1 Whether there is a specific role in charge of defining and keeping up-to-date accounting policies (accounting policies area or department) and resolving doubts or disputes over their interpretation, communicating on a regular basis with the team in charge of operations at the organisation. The role is also responsible for updating the accounting policies manual and disseminating it to the operating units.

This responsibility is held by Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management (reporting to the Corporate Management Control and Planning Department) which, among other duties, is in charge of defining, keeping up-to-date and communicating the Group's accounting policies for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial information in accordance with the standards adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) (and, consequently, of the information each subsidiary is required to report).

The Group has formalised a "Procedure for the preparation, updating and communication of accounting policies" which sets out the following:

·

Existence of a Group accounting manual

·

Update frequency

·

Communication with business units

·

Procedure for receiving and responding to queries regarding the accounting manual (Accounting legislation mailbox)

·

Procedure for updating the Reporting Package of accounting information to be received from subsidiaries

The duties of Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management also include responding to the accounting consultations tha t may be made by the various business units and other corporate departments of the Group.
As mentioned in section F.1.2, the Group has an accounting policy manual (GRAPH) for the purposes of preparing the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs), which is compiled by Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management and updated periodically (as least once a year), and includes the standards applicable during the year. The Audit Instructions sent by the external auditor to all the auditors of the various Group companies for the limited review or audit at each halfyearly or annual close, respectively, establish that the accounting policies to be applied in the performance of their work are those contained in Abertis' GRAPH.
Any amendments made are communicated to the subsidiaries by email, and a complete, updated manual is available in the Accounting Legislation Portal and in the Corporate Management Control Portal on the Group intranet. The manual was last updated in September 2018 and, in any event, is reviewed in the last quarter to verify that no significant amendments have been made that might affect the preparation of the consolidated financial information for the year.
Moreover, on a half-yearly basis, Consolidation and Accounting Legislation Management issues an information memorandum on the EU-IFRSs, which describes the standards that will come into force during the year and in future years, as well as a summary of the standards not yet approved that might have an impact on the consolidated financial statements and those of the subsidiaries.

23

F.4.2 Mechanisms in standard format for the capture and preparation of financial information, which are applied and used in all units within the company or group, and support its main financial statements and accompanying notes as well as disclosures concerning the ICFR system.
The Group has various integrated platforms both for the accounting recognition of transactions and the preparation of financial information for the majority of its subsidiaries (SAP R3·and BPC consolidation and reporting). The integrity and reliability of the afore mentioned IT systems is validated through the general controls indicated in section F.3.2.
Also, each of the subsidiaries is responsible for the preparation and upload in the reporting and corporate consolidation system (SAP BPC) of the monthly reporting, which contains the financial information required at each monthly close to prepare the consolidated information and other financial information required. The monthly reporting is a single reporting based on a standard chart of accounts for all the Group companies. Every six and twelve months "Half-yearly forms/Annual forms" (a single, standard information package for all the Group companies, which includes the monthly reporting and a reporting of "Additional Information - Financial Statements 2019") signed by the General Management of each of the subsidiaries are received, which include all the information required to prepare the Group's consolidated financial information (interim condensed financial statements).
The aforementioned "Half-yearly and annual forms" guarantee the homogeneity of information through the following characteristics:
· It is homogeneous and consistent for all countries and businesses. · It is prepared based on instructions and accounting manual of the Group, unique to all the companies that make up the Group. · Incorporates the applicable legal, fiscal, commercial and regulatory requirements.
The information of the monthly reporting and the "Forms" is loaded directly by the controllers in the reporting and corporate consolidation system. Periodically (minimum 2 times a year) the structures of the "Forms" are reviewed with the objective of ensuring that they include all the regulatory updates applicable under IFRS-EU.
The entire reporting system is included in the Monthly Reporting Information Manual, which is updated annually by the General Directorate of Planning and Control and which includes processes, dates and complete information about the completion of the reporting, which must be followed by all Group companies.
F.5. Oversight of system operation.
Provide information, indicating the salient features, on at least:
F.5.1 ICFR system monitoring activities performed by the Audit Committee, including an indication of whether the entity has an internal audit department whose competencies include supporting the Audit Committee in its role of monitoring the internal control system, including ICFR. Also describe the scope of the ICFR system assessment conducted in the year and the procedure for the person in charge to communicate the findings. State also whether the company has an action plan specifying corrective measures and whether it has taken stock of the potential impact on its financial information.
In 2019 the ACC or, in its absence, the Board of Directors performed the following activities in relation to the ICFR system:
· Periodical review of the financial information, considering the most relevant judgments and estimates. · Periodical monitoring of the certifications of the application of controls by the personnel responsible for preparing the financial
reporting. · Monitoring of the findings of the internal and external audit ICFR reviews. · Review of the information relating to the ICFR system forming part of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
The Group has an Internal Audit function (forming part of the General Secretary's Office and Corporate Affairs) that reports to the ACC (which delegates oversight of internal control systems, including the ICFR system). As a result of the supervisory tasks delegated t o it, Internal Audit plays a key role in ensuring an internal control system is in place that reasonably guarantees:
· Safeguarding of the Group's assets · Compliance with applicable external and internal regulations · Effectiveness and efficiency in the transactions and corporate and support activities · Transparency and completeness of the financial and management information
Internal Audit draws up an Annual Review Plan that is approved by the ACC and based on the following:
· The classification, by risk and materiality factors, of the companies controlled by the Group. · The definition of the activities to be reviewed: top-level transactional processes (revenue, procurements, fixed assets, employees,
financial management, technology, etc.), other transactional processes (travel, maintenance and warehouse expenses, etc.) and compliance (ICFR, etc.). · The definition of the frequency of the reviews for each of the foregoing processes based on the company classification.
In relation to the financial information and the general model of the SCIIF, in 2019 a review was made on the operation of the controls on relevant operations, judgments and estimates and preparation of the financial information. Likewise, reviews have been carried out on the
24

controls of general risks and information systems that are reviewed by applying the periodicity determined by the general rev iew criteria of Internal Audit. The potential weaknesses identified in all of the reviews are classified by criticality, assigned to a supervisor and subject to monitoring until they are resolved. As a result of the ICFR assessment activities conducted by the Internal Audit function in 2019, which were submitted to the ACC, no material weaknesses were detected which might have a material impact on the Group's financial reporting for 2019, and the corrective measures required to resolve other potential weaknesses in the future having been implemented. Also, the external auditor, as mentioned in section F.7.1., issues an annual agreed-upon procedures report on the description of the ICFR system prepared by Abertis in which no matters worthy of note arose.
F.5.2 Indicate whether there is a discussion procedure whereby the financial auditor (pursuant to TSAs), the internal audit department and other experts can report any significant internal control weaknesses encountered during their review of the financial statements or other reviews they have been engaged to perform to the company's senior executives and its Audit Committee or Board of Directors. State also whether the entity has an action plan to correct or mitigate the weaknesses identified.
As indicated above in section F.3.1, Abertis' "Review, Authorisation and Supervision of Financial Reporting Policy" establishes the ACC's review procedure which includes the following: · Meetings with those responsible for the preparation of the financial reporting (Corporate Management Control and Planning Department) to discuss the reasonableness of the changes in the aggregates, the most significant transactions or events during the period, changes in accounting policies, any unusual fluctuations and any other information deemed relevant.
· Discussions with the Internal Audit function (as part of the ongoing monitoring of reviews and recommendations made throughout the year) to obtain information on the level of compliance with the Plan and with the findings of the reviews performed (including ICFR) and on the current status of any recommendations made to improve the potential weaknesses identified.
· Private discussions with the external auditors (at least on completion of the planning phase of the audit of the financial statements for the year and on completion of their audit and/or limited review procedures on the financial statements and the half-yearly reporting) in order to obtain information on the scope and findings of their work and on any potential significant internal control weaknesses identified, the content of their reports and any other information deemed appropriate
F.6. Other relevant information
No additional aspects were identified for disclosure.
F.7. External auditor's report
F.7.1 Whether the ICFR system information reported to the markets has been reviewed by the external auditor. If "yes", the related report should be included in the corresponding report as an Appendix. If "no", give reasons.
The external auditor reviewed Abertis' ICFR information that was reported for 2019. The scope of the auditor's review procedures was set in accordance with the Spanish Institute of Certified Public Accountants Circular E14/2013, of 19 July 2013, publishing the Draft Guidance and specimen auditor's report relating to the information on the system of internal control over the financial information (ICFR) of listed entities.

These categories apply only to listed companies. Nevertheless, the spaces in the questionnaire require us to fill in a category. Thus, owing to the fact that all board members have been appointed at the proposal of the shareholders representing the 98.7 % of the Company's share capital, the category which has been filled in the questionnaire has been "proprietary", although such category does not apply to non listed companies.

The waiver will be granted by express agreement and separate from the General Meeting. In any case, at the request of any partner, the General Meeting will decide on the cessation of the director who develops competitive activities when the risk of damage to the company has become relevant. Finally, the Internal Code of Conduct of the Company in matters related to the securities markets, establishes that the Affected Persons will act in a conflict of interest situation at all times with loyalty to the Company, regardless of their own interests or those of others and must refrain from intervene or influence decision-making on issues affected by the conflict.
