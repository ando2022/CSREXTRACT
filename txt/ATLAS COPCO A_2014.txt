The business area achieved healthy order growth in all major regions and for most types of industrial tools and assembly systems. The growth was supported by the motor vehicle and general industries' investments and by strong development of the service business. The business area acquired Henrob, a pioneer and market leader in self-pierce riveting, and continued to invest in market presence, product development and service.

The demand for mining and rock excavation equipment remained at a low level and the order volumes were somewhat lower than in 2013. The service business was stable, while consumable orders were lower. The business area identified and implemented further efficiency measures to adapt the costs to the low demand, and it made one acquisition.

The order intake of construction equipment was largely unchanged. It improved in North America while it developed negatively in South America. Specialty rental as well as the service business developed well and the business area continued to invest in market presence and product development.

COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION IS KEY TO SUCCESS
Atlas Copco achieved record revenues in 2014 in a mixed business climate with a good contribution from strategic acquisitions and growth of the service business.The Group also achieved a record cash flow and a healthy profit. We stand strong and will keep growing stronger in our pursuit of being First in Mind--First in Choice ® and achieving sustainable productivity for our customers.

PRESIDENT AND CEO
"All together, service generates 43% of our revenue"

Standing strong The manufacturing industry was healthy and our sales of industrial tools as well as small and medium-sized compressors increased. Orders for construction equipment were largely unchanged in tough market conditions, while mining equipment and large compressors had a weak development due to low investments in Asia.
I am pleased to see that, in this challenging business climate with mixed demand for Atlas Copco's equipment and services, we were able to reinforce our strong market position and further strengthen our service business, which continued to grow at a healthy pace. In total, organic order growth was 1 %. We made a number of acquisitions, which created new opportunities with an extended product offering to our customers and contributed to the Group achieving record order intake and record revenues. The challenging business climate, particularly in our mining segment, forced us to take measures to improve efficiency to safeguard long-term competitiveness. We were able to report a healthy profit. For 2015 and beyond, the Group is standing strong and our guiding light remains our five strategic pillars for profitable growth: presence, innovation, service, operational excellence, and people.
Global presence With more than 44 000 employees working in 91 countries and with sales in more than 180 countries, Atlas Copco is truly a global

organization. In order to stay successful, we know we must be close to the customers. But presence is not only about geography. It is also about being in the right market segments with the right product offers and service capabilities. The Group made two major acquisitions in 2014 that gave us access to adjacent and very attractive markets. We started the year by welcoming Edwards Group, which made us a market leader in vacuum solutions. The vacuum technology, which creates a pure environment for sensitive manufacturing such as of semiconductors and flat panels, has many customers in common with our compressor operation. With Edwards part of the Group we can offer customers more comprehensive solutions to boost their productivity. The other was Henrob, which made us a market leader in self-pierce riveting, a mechanical fastening process for joining sheets of material where welding is difficult, such as aluminum. Car manufacturers are increasingly using this technology as they build vehicles from new materials to make them lighter and more energy efficient. For example, the all-new 2015 Ford F-150*, America's best-selling vehicle for 32 years, is built with a highstrength aluminum-alloy body with the help of Atlas Copco Henrob's technology.
Innovation to boost customer productivity Innovation continues to be a core focus for us. We now have more than 3 100 research and development engineers. We continuously optimize our investments in this area and work to reduce the time to market for our new inventions. Why are we so focused on innovation? Part of the answer is because it supports our goals for sustainable profitable development. We strive to increase our competitive edge by improving our customers' energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020 through products that are developed, manufactured and sourced responsibly. That is why we are so focused on providing high-quality products that are more productive, energy efficient, safer, ergonomic, lighter or that in other ways make customers more successful.
The GA VSD+ compressor that we launched in 2013 to great success is a perfect example of a very innovative machine that enhances customer productivity while also

benefiting the environment. Compressors are used virtually everywhere in society and industry: on construction sites, oil platforms, in hospitals, in the manufacturing and process industries, to name a few places. Atlas Copco pioneered the variable-speed drive (VSD) technology in 1994, enabling compressors to run only at the speed necessary, cutting energy consumption. The new VSD+ technology, which involves a unique, patented drive system, cuts energy use by more than half compared with traditional compressors. If every oil-injected screw compressor sold in the world was a VSD+, it would reduce annual CO2 emissions by more than 4 million tons, which is equivalent to the output of almost 900 000 cars. This is truly the compressor for the present and the one the world will need.
The mining industry is another area that is changing with innovation. Atlas Copco is offering automation technology that allows machine operators to remotely guide the equipment at a safe distance from high-risk areas. A key development focus for us now is multi-machine control, allowing one operator in a control room to look after several pieces of equipment, increasing efficiency for the customer.
Other innovative products include ergonomic assembly tools that not only tighten a bolt with the same torque every time but also offer traceability, giving the customer a track record of the assembly process. This is especially important for the automotive industry, where car quality and safety are so important.
A final example of new innovation is for the road construction equipment segment, where we have created a system used in our new Atlas Copco Dynapac rollers that cuts fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by ensuring that only the amount of power necessary at any given point is used.
Strong service for reliable machines Our service business continues to make good progress since 2008 when Compressor Technique got its own dedicated service division and 2011 when the other business areas followed. We now have almost 13 000 service employees in the Group and together with our indirect channels we are covering the entire planet. All together, service generates

PRESIDENT AND CEO
"To stay competitive we must remain asset light and agile"

43% of our revenue. We are expanding the use of Smartlink, a new data monitoring system for our compressors that alerts us exactly when the equipment needs service ­ a win-win situation for both customers and us.
Customers want to know that their machines will run smoothly as it can be very costly to have equipment not working. With our service the customer can rest assured we will safeguard that the installation runs when needed.
We must show more Atlas Copco customers that they will truly benefit from letting us ­ who, after all, know the equipment best ­ do the work. We strive to service virtually all of the equipment we have sold.
Operational excellence at all times Atlas Copco is constantly seeking to improve operations. We are connecting our colleagues around the globe, shortening assembly times and speeding up delivery while making it more reliable. Sometimes we have to consolidate manufacturing. At other times, unfortunately, we have to reduce the workforce, which was the case last year in the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area. To stay competitive, we must remain asset light and agile. To improve customer interaction and support, we are modernizing and digitalizing our operations, starting in Europe.
Operational excellence also involves providing a safe work environment for all our colleagues with no work-related accidents. A healthy and motivated workforce is key to success.
We stay committed to the UN Global Compact, which is reflected in our own Business Code of Practice. We believe that working with human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption also creates long-lasting business value. Leaders in sustainability have been shown to outperform financially, and we are proud to be included once again in the annual Global 100 list and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. We were ranked number seven globally in the Newsweek Green Rankings, one of the world's foremost scorings on corporate sustainability.

Commitment and competence We keep investing in employee training, convinced that we will have a competitive edge if our people master their tasks faster as they then can create more value for our customers. One example of this idea, which we call reducing the time to competence, is highlighted in the Construction Technique business area. One of its challenges had been how to efficiently train its technicians and sales people all over the world, considering they are speaking so many languages. Now, every time the business area launches a new product it will make a visually attractive video of the machines with neutral language that all can understand. All staff will see the videos before visiting customers. The customers benefit from interacting with knowledgeable Atlas Copco representatives who can find the best solutions to enhance productivity.
Atlas Copco seeks to attract competent colleagues who are eager to grow, and we want the workforce to be diverse when it comes to gender, age and nationalities. For the first time in our history, the ratio of female managers in the Group reached the same ratio as for female employees, about 17 %. The 417 most senior managers represent 54 nationalities, reflecting our ambition to use the full global talent pool.
Keep growing stronger I am confident Atlas Copco will continue to grow stronger by using these five strategic pillars to make customers more productive. The global long-term trends are on our side, including the industry's energy efficiency and productivity requirements, as well as urbanization that prompts infrastructure investments. This will support growth in Asia, South America and Africa, which have experienced some recent softer business conditions. North America looks solid, and Europe has a good chance to finally reconnect with growth.
We will expand our four business areas without stretching too far away from our core. We will keep expanding our market presence and further professionalize our service business, which still has great growth opportunities.

Finally We remember fondly the great Peter Wallenberg, our Honorary Chairman who passed away early this year. Peter will be remembered as the most committed Atlas Copco promoter and supporter ever. He was a true inspiration for me personally and for countless former colleagues and friends in Atlas Copco during his more than 61 active years with the Group.
Thank you to all our customers, business partners, employees, and shareholders for your loyalty and trust. We are a proud team, especially when we create productivity for our customers.

thus allowing the divisions to focus on their core businesses.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the organization and management of the Group, regularly assessing the Group's financial situation and financial, legal, social and environmental risks, and ensuring that the organization is designed for satisfactory control. The Board formally approves the Business Code of Practice.
The President and CEO is responsible for the ongoing management of the Group following the Board's guidelines and instructions. He is responsible for ensuring that the organization works towards achieving the goals for sustainable, profitable development.
The business areas are responsible for developing their respective operations by implementing and following up on strategies and objectives to achieve sustainable, profitable development.
The divisions are separate operational units, each responsible for delivering results in line with the strategies and objectives set by the business area. Each division has global responsibility for a specific product or service offering. A division can have one or more product companies (units responsible for product development, manufacturing and product marketing) and has several customer centers (units responsible for customer contacts, sales and service) dedicated or shared with other divisions.

THIS IS ATLAS COPCO

THIS IS HOW WE DO BUSINESS
Atlas Copco is characterized by focused businesses, a global presence with direct sales and service, a strong, stable and growing service business, professional people, and an asset-light and flexible manufacturing setup. Atlas Copco is committed to sustainable productivity, which means that we do everything we can to ensure reliable, lasting results with responsible use of resources ­ human, natural and capital.

Sales and service Customer focus is a guiding principle for Atlas Copco. The ambition is to have close relationships with end customers and to help them increase their productivity in a sustainable way. Sales and service is primarily direct, but complemented by alternative sales channels, e.g. through distrib utors, to maximize presence in the market. The Group has sales in more than 180 countries and about 80% of sales are made directly to the end user.
Sales of equipment are performed by engineers with strong application knowledge and the ambition to offer the best solution for the customer's specific application. Service and maintenance performed by skilled technicians is an integral part of the offer. Service

is the responsibility of dedicated divisions in each business area. The responsibility includes development of service products, sales and marketing, technical support as well as service delivery and follow-up.
Stable service business More than 40 % of revenues are generated from service (spare parts, maintenance, repairs, consumables, accessories, and rental). These revenues are more stable than equipment sales and provide a strong base for the business.
Increase customer loyalty Every day, and following sales and/or service interactions with Atlas Copco, thousands of

customers receive surveys where they are asked to give their opinion. Customers are often engaged in discussions about their feedback in order to solve problems and to improve products and services. A number of key performance indicators have been established, such as the availability of spare parts, which are continuously followed up to ensure that customer satisfaction improves.
Manufacturing and logistics The manufacturing philosophy is to manu facture in-house those components that are critical for the performance of the equipment. For non-critical components, Atlas Copco leverages the capacity and the competence of business partners and cooperates with them to continuously achieve product and process improvements. Approximately 75% of the production cost of equipment represents purchased components and about 25% are internally manufactured core components, assembly costs and overhead.
Equipment represents less than 60% of revenues and Atlas Copco has organized its manufacturing and logistics to be able to quickly adapt to changes in equipment demand. The manufacturing of equipment is primarily based on customer orders and only some standard, high volume equipment is manufactured based on projected demand.
The assembly of the equipment is to a large degree carried out in own facilities. The assembly is typically lean and flow oriented and the final product is normally shipped directly to the end user. The organization works continuously to use human, natural or capital resources more efficiently.

Innovation Atlas Copco believes that there is always a better way of doing things. Innovation and product development are very important and all products are designed internally. A key activity is to design new or improved products that provide tangible benefits in terms of productivity, energy efficiency and/ or lower life cycle cost to the customer, and at the same time can be efficiently produced.

THE BUSINESS CODE OF PRACTICE
The internal policy documents related to business ethics and social and environmental performance are summarized in the Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice. All employees and managers in Group companies, as well as business partners, are expected to adhere to these policies.

THIS IS ATLAS COPCO

Atlas Copco protects technical innovations with patents.
Innovation also includes better processes to improve the flow and utilization of assets and information. Innovation will improve customer satisfaction and contribute to strengthening customer relations, the brand, as well as financial performance. Overcapacities and inefficiencies must always be challenged.
Investments in fixed assets and working capital The needed investments in property, plant and equipment are moderate in size due to the manufacturing philosophy and can be adapted in the short and medium term to changes in demand. Most investments are related to machining equipment for core manufacturing activities and to production facilities, primarily for core component manufacturing and for assembly operations.
The working capital requirements of the Group are affected by the direct sales and service model, which affects the amount of inventory and receivables, as well as by the manufacturing philosophy. In an improving

business climate with higher volumes, more working capital will be tied up. If the business climate deteriorates, working capital will be released.
Acquisitions Acquisitions are primarily done in, or very close to, the already existing core businesses. All divisions are required to map and evaluate businesses that are adjacent and can offer tangible synergies with the existing businesses. All acquired businesses are expected to make a positive contribution to economic value added.

Human capital Atlas Copco strives to be a good employer to attract, develop, and keep qualified and motivated people. Employees are responsible for their own professional career and supported by continuous competence development and an internal job market. Employees are encouraged to grow professionally and take up new positions.
If the company needs to adapt capacity in a deteriorating business climate, the first action is to stop recruitment. Layoffs are the last resort.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW ­ ADMINISTRATION REPORT
THE YEAR IN REVIEW

MARKET REVIEW AND DEMAND DEVELOPMENT
The overall demand for Atlas Copco's equipment and services improved somewhat in 2014. The order intake of small and medium-sized compressors to the manufacturing industry increased, while orders for large compressors for the process industry decreased. The order intake for vacuum solutions was strong. The orders received for industrial tools and assembly systems increased, supported by investments from the motor vehicle, aerospace and electronics industries. The demand for construction equipment for infrastructure and civil engineering work was relatively soft and orders were largely unchanged. The demand for mining and rock excavation equipment remained at a low level and the order volumes were slightly lower compared to the previous year.
The service business continued to develop positively. Service and parts had an organic growth of nearly 5%. The specialty rental business also had a positive development, while consumables for mining and civil engineering had a negative development.
See also business area sections on pages 20­35. The Group's order intake increased 15 % to a record MSEK 93 873 (81 290). The organic order growth was 1%, more favorable exchange rates contributed with 2 % and acquisitions with 12%, of which 11% was attributable to Edwards.
North America The order intake in local currencies in North America increased 26% and 10 % excluding Edwards. Primarily the United States, but also Canada and Mexico achieved growth. The order volumes increased for industrial tools and assembly systems, for construction and mining equipment as well as for small- and medium-sized industrial compressors, while they were lower for large compressors. The service business grew in all business areas. In total, North America accounted for 23% (20) of orders received.

Europe The orders received in local currencies in Europe increased 10% and 4 % excluding Edwards. All business areas achieved low single digit organic growth. Geographically, there were small differences between the markets. The order volumes in southern and eastern Europe grew compared to the low levels of the previous year, while the order volumes in northern and western Europe remained fairly stable. The service business grew in all business areas. In total, Europe accounted for 30% (32) of orders received.
Africa/Middle East Orders received decreased 1% in local currencies in the Africa/Middle East region, which accounted for 10% (11) of the Group's orders received. The order intake increased for industrial compressors and tools and for construction equipment, but decreased for mining equipment. The service business grew in all business areas, except in Mining and Rock Excavation Technique.
Asia/Australia The orders received in local currencies in Asia/Australia increased 15%, but decreased 4% excluding Edwards. The investments in industrial tools and assembly systems increased and Industrial Technique achieved healthy growth. Also, the order intake for vacuum solutions were strong in the region, supported by good demand from the semiconductor industry. The order intake for industrial compressors, mining and construction equipment, however, decreased, negatively impacted by low investments in China, India and in several countries in South East Asia. The service business for industrial compressors and tools continued to grow at a high pace in the region. The service business for mining was stable, whereas it decreased for construction equipment. In total, Asia/Australia accounted for 28% (27) of orders received.

South America The South American orders increased 6% in local currencies. The order intake increased for all business areas, except for Construction Technique. The service business grew in all business areas. In total, South America accounted for 9% (10) of orders received.

Near-term demand outlook Published January 29, 2015 The overall demand for the Group is expected to increase somewhat.

The Group's goal for annual revenue growth is 8%, measured over a business cycle. At the same time the ambition is to grow faster than the most important competitors. Growth should primarily be organic, supported by selective acquisitions.

The operating profit for the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area decreased 29% to MSEK 4 307 (6 083), including impairment of assets and restructuring costs of MSEK 415 (120) and corresponding to a margin of 16.7% (21.0). The adjusted operating margin was 18.4% (21.4) and was impacted negatively by lower volumes and dilution from acquisitions, but was supported by currency.
The operating profit for the Construction Technique business area increased 2% to MSEK 1 768 (1 733), corresponding to a margin of 12.0% (12.4). The margin was negatively affected by product mix, but supported by currency.
Costs for common Group functions and eliminations increased to MSEK ­591 (­177), including the effect from the provision for sharerelated long-term incentive programs of MSEK ­174 (­62) and an insurance reimbursement of MSEK 40. Previous year's includes a gain of MSEK 90 related to a divestment of the captive insurance operations in Luxembourg and an insurance reimbursement of MSEK 155.
Depreciation and EBITDA Depreciation and amortization increased to MSEK 3 709 (2 703), mainly due to acquisitions. Earnings before depreciation and amortization, EBITDA, was MSEK 20 724 (19 759), corresponding to a margin of 22.1% (23.6).

Operating profit The operating profit was MSEK 17 015 (17 056), corresponding to a margin of 18.2% (20.3). Items affecting comparability were MSEK ­729 (63) and the adjusted operating margin was 18.9% (20.3). See also the bridge below.
The operating profit for the Compressor Technique business area increased 23% to MSEK 8 974 (7 279) and was affected by items affecting comparability of MSEK ­180. The adjusted margin was 21.7% (22.9) and was negatively affected by dilution from acquisitions and by investments in the sales and service organization.
The operating profit for the Industrial Technique business area increased 20% to MSEK 2 557 (2 138), corresponding to a margin of 22.3% (22.5). The operating margin was supported by higher volumes, but was negatively affected by dilution from acquisitions.

Net financial items The Group's net financial items totaled MSEK ­924 (­790). The net interest expense decreased to MSEK ­699 (­730). Other financial items were MSEK ­225 (­60). See note 9 and 27.
Profit before tax Profit before tax was MSEK 16 091 (16 266), corresponding to a profit margin of 17.2% (19.4).
Taxes Taxes for the year amounted to MSEK 3 916 (4 184), corresponding to an effective tax rate of 24.3% (25.7) in relation to profit before tax. See note 9.

The business had combined revenues in fiscal year 2013 of approximately MNZD 30 (MSEK 162) and around 120 employees.
Revenues, profits and returns Revenues increased 33% to MSEK 42 165 (31 782) with a strong contribution from acquisitions. The organic growth was 1%. Operating profit increased 23% to MSEK 8 974 (7 279), corresponding to a margin of 21.3% (22.9). The operating profit was positively affected by acquisitions and currency, but negatively by items affecting comparability of MSEK ­180. This includes MSEK 60 restructuring costs related to consolidation of manufacturing in the U.S, a negative effect of MSEK 50 related to a one-time acquisition accounting adjustment for currency derivatives entered by Edwards prior to the acquisition, and several smaller items. The adjusted operating margin was 21.7% (22.9) and was negatively affected by dilution from acquisitions and by investments in the sales and service organization. The return on capital employed was 40% (65), negatively affected by the acquisition of Edwards.

PRODUCTION RISKS
SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS

Core component manufacturing is concentrated in a few locations and if there are interruptions or lack of capacity in these locations, this may have an effect on deliveries or on the quality of products.
Production facilities could also have a risk of damaging the environment through operations, e.g. through hazardous waste and emissions.
Atlas Copco is directly and indirectly exposed to raw material prices.
Atlas Copco and its business partners such as suppliers, sub-contractors and joint venture partners, must share the same values as expressed in Atlas Copco's Business Code of Practice, otherwise there is a risk of compromising the Group's reputation and brand. The availability of many components is dependent on suppliers and if they have interruptions or lack capacity, this may have an undesirable effect on deliveries.
The use of many suppliers gives rise to the risk that products contain components which are not sustainably produced, e.g. that electronic components contain conflict minerals (whose trade or taxation fund armed groups in conflict areas such as the Democratic Republic of Congo).

P Manufacturing units continuously monitor the production process, test the safety and quality of the products, make risk assessments, and train employees.
P Manufacturing units invest in modern equipment that can perform multiple operations.
P Production units are subject to continuous risk management surveys to safeguard that they comply with the Atlas Copco loss prevention standard.
P Goal to certify all manufacturing units in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard.
P Select and evaluate business partners on the basis of objective factors including quality, delivery, price, and reliability, as well as commitment to environmental and social performance.
P Continue the process to investigate and eradicate the presence of conflict minerals in its value chain.
P Establishment of a global network of subsuppliers, to prevent supplier dependency.
P Business partners sign a compliance letter to the Business Code of Practice.
P E-learning for business partners developed to raise awareness of the Business Code of Practice.

 Continued opportunities to extensively promote operational excellence to streamline production, minimize inefficiencies and maintain a high flexibility in the production process.
 Cost increases for raw materials and components often coincide with strong end-customer demand and can partly be compensated by increased sales to mining customers and by increased market prices.
 Further increase business agility and reduce costs by improving supplier inventory management in response to changes in demand.
 Continue to be a preferred business partner and promote efficiency, sustainability and safety. Good supplier relations help to improve Atlas Copco's competitive position.

Atlas Copco primarily distributes products and services directly to the end customer. If the distribution is not efficient, it may impact customer satisfaction, sales and profits.
Some sales are made indirect through distributors and rental companies and their performance can have a negative effect on sales.
The distribution of products can result in increased CO2 emissions from transport.
The integration of acquired businesses is a cumbersome process and it is not certain that it will be successful. Synergies can take longer to materialize.
Annual impairment tests are made on acquired goodwill. If goodwill is not deemed justified in such tests it can result in a write-down, affecting the Group's result.
Acquisitions and divestments can impact local communities and/or the environment, directly or indirectly.
Changes in exchange rates can adversely affect Group earnings when revenues from sales and costs for production and sourcing are denominated in different currencies (transaction risks). An adverse effect on Group earnings can also occur when earnings of foreign subsidiaries are translated into SEK and on the value of the Group equity when the net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into SEK (translation risks).
Atlas Copco's net interest cost is affected by changes in market interest rates.
Atlas Copco is exposed to the risk of nonpayment by any of its extensive number of end customers to whom sales are made on credit.

P Physical distribution of products is concentrated to a number of distribution centers and the delivery efficiency of these is continuously monitored.
P Resources are allocated to training and development of the service organization.
P As indirect sales are local/regional, the negative impact of poor performance is limited.
P Increased focus on smarter and more effective transports to reduce the total emissions per transport.
P The Group has established an Acquisitions Process Council which provides training and supports all business units prior to, during and post an acquisition.
P Atlas Copco guidelines and policies are applied to assess and manage the environmental and social impact of operations in the affected communities after an acquisition is complete.
P Human rights and environmental considerations are integrated when acquisitions and divestments are made.
P A Financial Risk Management Committee meets regularly to manage financial risks.
P The Group's operations continuously monitor and adjust sales prices and costs to limit the transaction risk. These measures can be complemented with hedging.
P Translation risks are partially hedged by borrowings in foreign currency and financial derivatives.
P Stringent credit policies are applied and there is no major concentration of credit risk. The provision for bad debt is based on historical loss levels and is deemed sufficient. In the case of Atlas Copco Customer Finance, an in-house financing operations, risks are mitigated by retaining security in the equipment until full payment is received, by purchasing credit risk insurance and/or by transferring the risk to a third party.

 Continue to strengthen the relationship with customers through timely deliveries of products and services.
 Transport efficiencies can save the customer time and cost while reducing the environm ental impact of their own operations.
 Reduce fuel costs and resource requirements which improves business agility for the Group.
 Identifying the obstacles to integration can allow Atlas Copco to improve the process through methods such as job rotation, training or team building exercises. This would not only result in a smoother integration process but also lower operational costs by decreasing downtime and allowing newly acquired companies to become productive and efficient more rapidly.
 Working proactively with financial risks improves the profit margin and also creates possibilities for more stable cash flow. Overall, financial risk mitigation has the ability to improve business resilience for Atlas Copco.
 Atlas Copco Customer Finance can improve customer relations and attract more customers.

OPTIMIZING CUSTOMERS' PRODUCTIVITY

Atlas Copco delivers cutting-edge technology in the form of safe, reliable and energyefficient products designed to optimize customers' productivity and competitive advantage. The Group's high quality service offerings ensure that the customers get the most out of every investment, keeping Atlas Copco First in Mind--First in Choice ®.

With world-class customers in every corner of the world, Atlas Copco's biggest challenge is to continue to meet their need for sustainable products to increase their productivity. Driving the Group's innovations through cooperation with customers as well as partnerships with universities have proved to be a successful approach to maintaining a leading market position. Atlas Copco's longlasting relationships with suppliers also allow the Group to leverage their competence in order to further develop product and service offerings. Atlas Copco's value chain approach to innovations safeguards its customers' productivity and satisfaction while contributing to Atlas Copco's own sustainability goals to reduce its environmental impact ­ a clear win-win situation.
Product development from a lifecycle perspective Atlas Copco takes a lifecycle approach to innovation, and some business areas have dedicated eco-design engineers who assess the impact of the Group's sourced materials, product energy consumption and disposal options when developing products.
Choosing the right materials during the product design can impact the quality, shelf life and disposal of Atlas Copco's products, but these decisions can have a major impact on society and the environment as well. For

The amount invested in product development, including capitalized expenditures, increased 30 % to MSEK 2 991 (2 306) corresponding to 3.2 % (2.7) of revenues and 3.9% (3.5) of operating expenses. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions.
Product energy efficiency Atlas Copco has a goal to increase customers' energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, which is a challenging figure to consolidate at Group level due to the Group's highly diverse product portfolio. Therefore, no total figure for the Group is presented for 2014, instead the performance is highlighted with product lines from each business area.

Each product line measures its energy efficiency in a manner that best reflects its application at the customer site. For example, in 2014 surface drill rigs achieved 17% improvement in energy efficiency compared to 2010 by reducing the grams of fuel needed per m3 of rock excavated. Electrical nutrunners, which are significantly smaller in size and have a different application in the vehicle manufacturing industry, achieved a 4 % increase in energy efficiency for their customers. The portable compressor line XAHS 186, which is popular in Europe and used for abrasive blasting, shotcreting and construction drilling applications, delivered an improvement of 29 % in 2014. The variable speed drive compressors (VSD) improved energy efficiency by 19 % in 2014 (ESG note 10).

ATLAS COPCO'S REVOLUTIONARY VSD COMPRESSORS HAVE SAVED 3 870 MILLION kWh OF ELECTRICITY IN 20 YEARS

In 2014, Atlas Copco celebrated the 20th anniversary of a groundbreaking innovation that has had a major impact on energy efficiency in the industrial world. In the two decades since the company first introduced variable speed drive (VSD) technology into its air compressors, it calculates that industry has saved around 3 870 million kWh of electricity by using Atlas Copco VSD compressors.
The figure, based on a comparison with conventional fixed speed compressors, represents sufficient electricity to supply all of the households in the city of Paris for a year, and in terms of carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to taking 560 000 cars off the road for a year.
In 2013, Atlas Copco launched the VSD+ range, offering an additional 15 % improvement in energy savings to take the total to 50 % on average. With compressed air accounting for around 10 % of overall energy consumption in industry, the VSD technology has been a significant contributor to energy efficiency and the potential for further savings is still there. Calculations suggest that if every oil-injected screw compressor sold in the world would be a VSD+, the annual energy savings would equal some 6 TWh. (ESG note 10).

Building a fair, diverse workplace Like many of its industry peers, Atlas Copco's ambition to recruit a workforce that reflects the diversity found in society faces its first challenge in the classrooms. Atlas Copco's strategy to encourage more women and national minorities to join engineering programs is through active engagement with local universities. For example, a customer center in China has run a scholarship program with four selected universities that benefits 123 students. The scholarship strives to ensure that a minimum 15% of final winners are from the non-Han nationality, a minority in China. It also has a special award for "Female Volunteers" and "Female Excellent Teachers" to encourage gender diversity. The proportion of female recent graduates recruited during the year among white-collar workers was 31% (22).
The Group is committed to promoting equal opportunity in its hiring and promotion processes. A wide range of efforts to recruit diversity are in place globally, such as ensuring job ads are not subject to gender specifications. In 2014, women represented 17.1% (16.8) of Atlas Copco's workforce.
Aside from recruitment, Atlas Copco puts great effort into creating a fair and inclusive workplace that can support a diverse workforce. In 2014, Atlas Copco Mexico won an award for its workplace policy that promotes flexible work hours for new mothers and other benefits. Many companies, such as Atlas Copco Peru, have taken significant efforts to reduce the barriers for

women to transition back to work after having children, such as creating facilities for nursing mothers. Atlas Copco Russia had a focused initiative to recruit physically disabled individuals, a group that often faces stigma in the local society. These examples represent how Atlas Copco companies establish local diversity policies and guidelines in alignment with Group policy, local laws and regulations, and local ambitions.
When it comes to leadership, Atlas Copco strives to strike a balance between developing the local workforce while also offering international opportunities through internal mobility. Therefore, managers whose nationality differ from the country where they are stationed, focus on developing local leaders while gaining international professional experience which equips them for even more challenging positions within the Group. Overall, Atlas Copco has managers on international assignments coming from 56 countries and working in 61. In 2014, a total of 62% (63) of all senior managers were locally employed. 54 nationalities are represented among the 417 most senior managers worldwide. The share of Swedish managers on international assignments has decreased from 23% in 2001 to 11% in 2014. The proportion of women in management positions increased to 16.6% (16.2).

PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES

Employee turnover can be challenge for high growth markets such as China, a risk which the Group manages through talent programs. For example, Industrial Technique`s Challenger program focuses on ensuring a solid pipeline of talents for specialist functions and leadership. It uses global crossfunctional projects to challenge, develop and motivate talents and increase mobility.

The program also has a 180/360 follow up with the participants and coaching sessions with the manager and HR manager. As a result, in 2014 the business area retained 88% of the managers who participated, and 45% of these managers also took on new assignments within the Group, of which 4% were positions abroad.

developing competence, but also for successful integration of newly acquired companies. Experienced managers in senior positions lead the integration process and make it possible to establish the Group's Business Code of Practice, values and vision in an efficient and pragmatic manner. In 2014, the average number of training hours per employee was 41 (40) hours and 82% (82) of employees had an appraisal.
One measure of success of the focus on competence building within Atlas Copco is the percentage of employees with a university degree. In 2014, 53% (53) of the whitecollar employees had a university degree.
Developing a leadership pipeline In order to retain the competence, the Group has a target to recruit 85% of managers internally, and the outcome in 2014 was 88%. One of the key success factors to retaining talent while still growing competence and encouraging mobility, is the internal job market, which was created in 1992. In 2014, 3 856 positions were advertised, of which 349 were international. In 2014, internal mobility among employees was 7.2% (7.7). Overall external recruitment reached 10%, excluding acquisitions.

Safety and health enhance productivity Atlas Copco has a global Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) policy to ensure that workplaces have robust standards for safety, health and ergonomics. In 2014, 91% (representing 89% of employees) of the major companies in the Group were certified in accordance with the international standard OHSAS 18001. In terms of the workforce profile, 69 % of Atlas Copco employees were dedicated to building world-class products for its customers or delivering high-quality service and sales offerings. This involves working with heavy machinery or driving long distances to reach customers which can often be dangerous if proper safety routines are not followed.
There was one fatality reported in 2014, which involved a road safety accident in Thailand. The Group has taken additional steps to plan a new safety concept that emphasizes road safety and defensive driving behavior, which will be rolled out in 2015. The number of accidents per million working hours for Atlas Copco employees dipped to 4.7 (5.4) showing a favorable trend (ESG note 4). In 2014, Atlas Copco included reporting on accidents and incidents in the additional workforce as well. The resulting

calculation of accidents is 4.8 per million working hours. The number of incidents per million working hours stayed stable, and the new safety concept will strive to drive behavioral changes regarding safety while promoting the importance of reporting accidents and incidents.
Having a healthy work environment is as important for Atlas Copco's productivity as supporting employees with a healthy lifestyle. Atlas Copco companies design health and wellness programs to meet the specific needs of their country or region. For example the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a major concern in some countries where Atlas Copco operates and with a high prevalence in the age group (15­49 years) that would impact the workforce the most. In other countries, diseases such as diabetes are a growing concern and employees are offered wellness programs including consultation and medication.
Atlas Copco strives to promote health and wellness but also accommodates for the realistic possibility that employees may need time off for health reasons. This is reflected in the Group goals and in 2014 sick leave was at 1.9% (2.0) which is below the accepted level of 2.5 %.

systematic and on-demand training. Tools such as rapid e-learning and enhanced competency models have already been developed, and initiatives such as global English training concepts are underway. The success of the Time to Competence approach will be monitored through a number of key performance indicators on the quantity and quality of the training and the maturity of the learning culture within the Group.

Employee satisfaction survey results Atlas Copco conducts a Group employee survey at least every second year, the most recent one was carried out in 2014. The survey is available, in 32 languages in web and paper-based formats, to all employees (excluding employees at Edwards, which was recently acquired).

YEAR (vision: 100%) 2014 2012 2010 2008

% RESPONSE RATE
88 85 79 69

The survey covers various topics such as confidence in leadership, workplace culture, customer commitment and Atlas Copco's employer branding potential. In 2014, more than 35 000 employees participated in the survey, giving a respond rate at a record high 88%. All areas in the survey remain on a stable, high level. Customer commitment is still valued higher than any other area, which shows the important connection between proud employees and loyal customers. Local management will follow up on areas identified for improvement in the coming year, and hold employee workshops to improve weaknesses and capitalize on strengths.

Committed to high labor standards As a voluntary member of the UN Global Compact since 2008, Atlas Copco ensures that advised labor practices such as the right to collective bargaining are included in the Business Code of Practice, which is updated regularly. The Group views trade unions and employee representatives as a necessary and valuable support system for its people, and fosters relationships based on mutual respect and constructive dialogue. In 2014, 39% of all employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and it is estimated that several hundred consultations/negotiations took place with unions regarding working conditions and organizational changes. As a decentralized organization, this engagement and constructive dialogue with labor unions takes place at a local level. In countries where no independent labor union may exist, Atlas Copco has taken measures to establish forums for employer/employee relations, for example in China, through environment and safety committees. A non-discrimination policy covers all employees and the Business Code of Practice also covers employee rights. For full disclosure on wages and employee benefits, see note 5.

BUSINESS PARTNERS
Business partners such as suppliers, sub-contractors and joint venture partners are crucial strategic partners for Atlas Copco's success. Nurturing long-term relationships with business partners is mutually beneficial, securing the Group's competitive edge and development potential in a responsible and sustainable way. This is why Atlas Copco is committed to working with business partners who share the Group's high standards of quality, business ethics and resource efficiency.

Atlas Copco's purchasing strategies are decentralized to give the organization higher flexibility. Purchasing councils oversee supply chain management at a divisional level, but come together as a part of the Group purchasing council to develop central policies and tools that impact all operations. Local purchasing (non-core) is encouraged to generate societal value in the communities where Atlas Copco operates, by creating job opportunities as well as generating direct and indirect income. This is mostly carried out by individual companies and also facilitates close relationships with local partners to capitalize on opportunities to further improve quality and efficiency, and decrease environmental impact from transport.
However, business partners are not limited to suppliers alone. The Business Code of Practice includes other key players such as subcontractors, agents and distributors in the definition and therefore Atlas Copco has taken a value-chain approach to working with business partner issues.
All business partners are impartially evaluated on parameters including price, quality, reliability as well as key environmental, social and ethical concerns. The main tools for evaluating business partners are the 10-point checklist based on the UN Global Compact and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental

Principles and Rights at Work, as well as through on-site visits (ESG note 5). Tier 1 suppliers are expected to work to safeguard Atlas Copco's standards for Tier 2 suppliers. In addition to this, for agents and distributors, the Group started using the customer sustainability tool in 2013 in order to investigate potential risks and develop the relationships further (ESG note 8).
Supplier evaluation processes and local training efforts Atlas Copco has an extremely large international supplier base, which presents significant challenges in maintaining supply chain standards. Atlas Copco prioritizes follow-up activities with suppliers who represent the bulk of the annual purchase value as well as the highest risk in order to safeguard that the Business Code of Practice is being followed while still using our resources efficiently. In 2014, the Group continued to work with significant suppliers, with a focus on potential human rights and corruption risks. As a result, a greater proportion of sourcing from high-risk countries is followed up through self-assessment questionnaires or on-site audits, even if purchasing volumes are low. Atlas Copco's business partner selection letter was also updated in 2013 with the objective to improve compliance as well as to integrate conflict minerals into the human rights

FIGHTING CORRUPTION WITH INTEGRITY PACTS
Many markets where Atlas Copco operates, such as Indonesia, rank high on Transparency International's corruption perception index. Atlas Copco Indonesia engages in nonexclusive but binding integrity pacts with its suppliers, distributors and agents. Companies who have signed an integrity pact commit to working with the highest ethical standards and transparency in all of their business dealings. This also unifies Atlas Copco and its business partners effectively as a block of companies with more influence and ability to fight corruption. Along with the integrity pact, Atlas Copco Indonesia also engages with business partners through training and direct dialogue on the Group's business partner criteria. The integrity pact approach is being used by Atlas Copco in other markets where corruption is also a challenge.

based requirements. Compliance with the environmental, social and business ethics clauses in the checklist is required for 100 % of new agreements. However, for non-redflag issues (such as having environmental management systems), Atlas Copco tries to work with business partners to set up an action plan to help them meet the criteria within 6­12 months' time.
Strengthened approach to human rights and corruption risks Atlas Copco's business partner network includes markets with a high risk from a human rights and corruption perspective. This risk is particularly heightened in conflict-affected regions, and in 2013 Atlas Copco initiated processes to ensure that the Group is not complicit in human rights violations in accordance to its commitment to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The lack of enforcement of legal and political infra structure in some of these complex markets represents a challenge, however Atlas Copco has received support and advice from investors and non-governmental organizations through stakeholder dialogue.
Performance from supplier evaluations Supplier evaluations are primarily carried out by product companies. A supplier is considered approved if Atlas Copco has performed an assessment at the supplier's site and reported that there is no risk of violating the the Business Code of Practice, or that the supplier has acted on all development suggestions for the action plan from a previous evaluation. In 2014, 1 369 (846) significant suppliers were audited for quality and 1 192 (670) for safety, health, environmental and ethical standards. Of those, 17 (17) significant suppliers were rejected due to quality issues and another 14 (8) for safety, health, environmental and ethical standards (ESG note 5).

SOCIETY
Given its global reach Atlas Copco has an influence on the economic and social development of the countries in which it operates. The Group is expected to demonstrate that influence in a positive way and strives to be a good and reliable corporate citizen by creating shared value.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW

In the long-term, sound business practices are economically profitable since business is more efficient and establishes the Group's reputation as a reliable and trustworthy partner that conducts business with integrity. From a short-term perspective, following Atlas Copco's principles could have an adverse impact on some business opportunities.

HOTLINE
47 possible violations of the Code were reported through the hotline during 2014

Zero tolerance against corruption Corruption has very negative global consequences and is both a cause of poverty and a barrier to overcoming it. The fight against corruption is also central to working with human rights and environmental impacts, since corruption can cripple the governmental bodies and processes needed to address the issues. The Atlas Copco Group has a zero tolerance policy, which applies to all employees as well as the Board of Directors. The Board has also explicitly communicated that corruption is never an acceptable excuse for securing a sale, and this applies also to facilitation payments. This basic rule strengthens the brand and contributes to fair market competition.
Prevent, detect, react Not accepting corruption may sound simple, however, being a global company that operates in many cultures with different norms means that it is a demanding challenge to implement. The goal of no corruption or bribes is supported by a policy, procedures, training and monitoring process. When incidents are reported, firm action is taken on a case-by-case basis (ESG note 6). There are no negative consequences, such as demotion,

penalty or other reprisals, for employees refusing to receive or pay bribes or for reporting violations. Internal control procedures are set up to minimize the risk of corruption and bribes, e.g. segregation of duty. Internal audits include compliance to the Business Code of Practice. Awareness of, and compliance with, principles of integrity in all business dealings is a priority for Atlas Copco.
The Group hotline can be used by employees to report behavior or actions that are, or may be perceived as, violations of laws or of the Business Code of Practice. It serves as a complement to similar processes on country level. The Group Legal department is responsible for managing the hotline and ensures that reports are treated confidentially. The person reporting is guaranteed anonymity.
Training The Business Code of Practice is given to all new employees and training is provided globally. Managers also receive in-depth classroom training with dilemma cases. The training on corruption developed by the UN Global Compact was taken by managers before signing the Business Code of Practice compliance statement.

The nature of the violations mostly related to organizational changes and personal issues. Activities to address the reports include internal audits, job rotation and communication. (ESG note 6)
Human rights Human rights are integrated into the Group goals and are driven in the organization by the Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice. The Group's Human Rights Statement is published on the Atlas Copco website, and the Group strives to work with human rights through its own operations as well as through its business relations. Atlas Copco's business partners are expected to observe the same high standards regarding human rights as Atlas Copco does. Through internal control processes Atlas Copco ensures that Group companies have internal processes in place to inform customers and business partners about its human rights policies and to assess possible reputational risks. In 2014, the Human Rights and Ethics Steering

WATER FOR ALL ­ 30 YEARS OF EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT
In 2014, the Atlas Copco Group's main community engagement initiative Water for All celebrated 30 years. It was founded in 1984 by Atlas Copco employees and supports projects that give people in need access to clean drinking water. By the end of 2014, the initiative had representation in more than 35 countries, with more under way. All local chapters are initiated and run by Atlas Copco employees who also contribute to the same through donations, often via their salaries. All donations are doubled by the company. Since the start, Water for All has provided access to clean drinking water to more than 1.5 million people.
More information: www.water4all.org

Committee initiated trainings and continued to develop Atlas Copco's approach. The Committee reports to the Compliance Board, which includes two members from Group Management. The Committee also offers support to the organization as work to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Due diligence on human rights A process to assess and manage the social impact of operations on communities and human rights was developed and tested in Ghana and Kazakhstan in 2011. In 2014, Atlas Copco investigated human rights issues related to the construction of a dam project in Colombia and worked with industry peers, governmental representatives and civil society to develop an action plan. The plan is based on the recommendations of the UN Guiding Principles in order to increase Atlas Copco's leverage and positive contribution. Due diligence activities are being planned for Myanmar in 2015 (ESG note 8).
Customer conduct Atlas Copco recognizes the importance of safeguarding its reputation by working with customers who adhere to the same standards for environmental, ethical and social responsibility. The Group continues to build awareness of its ethical guidelines. The roll out of the customer sustainability assessment tool continued, and the Group's overall human

rights strategy was piloted with stakeholders in various markets (ESG note 8). This tool is already in use in cases of financing by credit export agencies, and Atlas Copco has shared it with industry peers who are also developing their approach.
Community engagement and charity Water for All is Atlas Copco's main employee-led initiative, and the Group matches the financial donations made by employees with double the amount. The Group's Community Engagement and Charity Policy also encourages companies to give support following natural and humanitarian disasters in the form of products, time or money. The community engagement and charity spend during 2014 was distributed accordingly: cash donations 90 %, in kind 1%, and time value 9 %. In 2014, the world saw a new outbreak of Ebola, a virus that causes severe illness and often death. The outbreak spans several countries where Atlas Copco has sales, via distributors, but no operations, mainly Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. To secure the health of its employees, the Group banned travel to those three countries and took other precautions such as travel advice, such as limiting the use of overpopulated buses, and purchase of preventive equipment such as sanitizers for personnel in several countries. In total, 1% of Atlas Copco's community and charity investments went towards disaster relief.

Development and distribution of economic value Atlas Copco creates employment and financial stability through subcontracting manufacturing and other activities. Operating costs including costs to suppliers for goods and services, functional costs deducted for employee wages and benefits amounted to MSEK 56 460 (49 079). Employee wages and benefits paid increased by 14 % to MSEK 20 826 (18 274). The increase was primarily due to acquisitions.
The Group's providers of capital, for example shareholders and creditors, provide funds to finance the asset base that is used to create economic value. In return, these stakeholders receive annual dividend and interest. The costs for providers of capital including dividend, increased by 1% to MSEK 7 919 (7 853).
Atlas Copco contributes to economic development within the regions where it operates, through payments to pension funds and social security, and payments of taxes, social costs and other duties. In 2014, the cost for direct taxes to governments decreased 3 % to MSEK 4 169 (4 286). The Group has been in dialogue with stakeholders regarding disclosure of taxes by country (note 9 and ESG note 9). Community investments amounted to MSEK 17 (14).
The economic value retained decreased 1 % to MSEK 5 240 (5 311).

THE YEAR IN REVIEW
ENVIRONMENT

Atlas Copco strives to reduce its environmental footprint across the value chain and delivers energyefficient products designed with a life cycle approach.
Impact from acquisitions Atlas Copco's strategy for growth relies partly on acquisitions, which can have an influence on the Group's environmental performance. A product company in China acquired in 2013 uses water for heat treatment and other processes, and this environmental aspect was a focus area for improvement. In 2014, the heat treatment plant began using a recycled water system and broken penstocks that deliver water have been repaired to reduce consumption. This lead to a reduced the water consumption by about 11 000 m3. Furthermore, a separate water meter has been installed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of water management. Heating furnaces have been repaired to reduce emissions and energy consumption and an environmental awareness training for employees is currently ongoing at this site.
Another recent acquisition, Edwards, is currently one of the top emitters of CO2 from both energy and transport and also focusing on reducing waste. Compared to other product companies, these entities conduct extensive machining operations in house, which results in a comparatively higher consumption pattern. Other reasons include air-conditioned shop floors that are necessary for product tolerance reasons. Investments to improve the environmental impact are under way and include activities such as switching to LED light sources and to lower the electricity consumption related

to temperature regulation. Logistics efficiency efforts are also ongoing in order to reduce air freight. All Asian service hubs for Edwards now have sea freight routes, and the same is being implemented for other hubs as well. This has resulted in significant cost savings while reducing the environmental impact.
Environmental risk management Atlas Copco face risks driven by changes in environmental regulations, availability of resources and other developments. Managing these risks, can also create opportunities.
Energy security Diversifying sources of energy to include renewable sources not only has a positive environmental impact but can also benefit the business by protecting it from price fluctuations in the availability and affordability of traditional energy sources. In 2014, 34% (37) of energy consumption in production sites came from renewable sources such as wind energy, hydropower and solar power. Growth markets such as India rely heavily on non-renewable sources as coal, however rapid population growth makes it difficult for energy production to keep up with the demands. In 2014, Atlas Copco's product company in Hyderabad, India, switched to solar power, which is estimated to keep the energy cost and supply steady in the long-term. While it is important to prioritize switching to renewable energy sources in such markets, Atlas Copco faces significant challenges in markets where governmental infrastructure is not in place to supply alternative energy, especially in regions where solar energy is not a viable option.

Waste recovery The main raw material going into the process is steel, and scrap metal represents the most significant portion of waste. Practically all of this scrap is reused or recycled. There are initiatives to reduce landfill waste, as well as the waste generated from packaging materials.
Hazardous waste in Atlas Copco's operations includes primarily cadmium, beryllium and lead. Atlas Copco tracks various categories of waste from the production process, including regulated (sometimes referred to as hazardous) waste. Restricted substances are not yet legally excluded from use but should be replaced according to a plan that takes into account technical and financial aspects. Prohibited substances are not allowed in the Group's products or processes. In 2014, Atlas Copco initiated an internal survey to follow up the compliance of these lists and to identify improvement areas. Group companies monitor the handling of hazardous waste by business partners.
Water risk management With operations in several countries facing water scarcity, Atlas Copco has started to use water indices to identify operations located in water-risk areas. Group companies in these areas should implement a water-risk management plan, from physical, legislative or cost perspectives. Innovative product design also aims to

reduce water use when drilling to explore for minerals, for example. Business areas analyze reported data to identify the highest consuming entities in order to focus the efforts to reduce the impact.
Investing in manufacturing efficiency Reducing energy consumption can reduce operational costs for Atlas Copco as well as for customers. In 2014, the Group launched a focused campaign to increase environmental awareness and resource efficiency, which is expected to show results in the coming year.
Process efficiencies in operations Wuxitec, a manufacturing facility in China, used to be the largest water consumer for the Compressor technique business area. The site achieved a significant reduction, including a 40 % reduction from the previous year during the peak consumption month as a

result of careful mapping of water consumption and targeted activities such as upgrading cooling towers. All employees at the site are involved and engaged in the review of the daily water consumption scorecards. Significant investments have been made to upgrade equipment at various sites which improves the energy efficiency of the sites and also reduces waste.
Logistical efficiency Two of the Group's largest distribution centers achieved a reduction in gram CO2 per tonne km by 65 % and a 33% reduction in cost as a result of consolidating their deliveries to a common logistical center in Russia and switching from air to road transport. Air shipments have been reduced to the transport of breakdown or emergency orders only, and other modal shifts have also been introduced to improve the environmental impact and logistics efficiency.

A relative decrease in water use is primarily due to efficiency measures and proactively addressing leakages

IN MEMORIAM: PETER WALLENBERG

Peter Wallenberg 1926 ­2015

Atlas Copco Honorary Chair Peter Wallenberg, who was active with the Group for more than 61 years, passed away at the age of 88 years in January 2015. He played an important role in the Swedish and international business communities.
Peter Wallenberg, born 1926, began his long and productive partnership with Atlas Copco in 1953 when he joined as an employee at a service workshop in Nacka, Sweden.
Eager to learn about all aspects of the company and not afraid to take on tough physical tasks, Peter Wallenberg worked for a period in the Kärrgruvan mine in Sweden where he learned to operate rock drilling

machines. In 1956 he moved to the United States as a compressor sales engineer. Though he was a lawyer at this time, he learned the technical matters including how to service the equipment.
In 1959 he left for Atlas Copco in Africa, where he served as Managing Director for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi) and later also for the Congo. He served in the United Kingdom before returning to Sweden as Managing Director for Mining and Construction Technique in 1968. In 1974 he became Chair of the Board of Directors, a position he held for 22 years. From 1996 he served as Honorary Chairman.

" Peter Wallenberg will be remembered as the most committed Atlas Copco promoter and supporter ever," said Ronnie Leten, President and CEO for the Atlas Copco Group. "He was a true inspiration for me personally and for countless of former colleagues and friends in the Group."
When Peter Wallenberg stepped down as Chair in 1996, Atlas Copco established an award in his name. The Peter Wallenberg Marketing and Sales Award recognizes the most innovative and successfully implemented method in the field of sales and marketing. The award is presented every year at Atlas Copco's Annual General Meeting in Stockholm, Sweden.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW ­ ADMINISTRATION REPORT
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
This section includes a description of Atlas Copco's system of internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance and as stipulated by the Swedish Companies Act.

The internal control process is based on a control environment that creates structure for the other four components of the process ­ risk assessment, control activities, information and communication as well as monitoring. The starting point for the process is the regulatory framework for internal control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring

Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), www.coso.org.
The basis for the internal control is defined by the overall control environment. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing an efficient system for internal control and governs the work through the CEO. Group Management sets the tone

for the organization, influencing the control consciousness of the employees. One key success factor for a strong control environment lies in ensuring that the organizational structure, decision hierarchy, corporate values in terms of ethics and integrity as well as authority to act, are clearly defined and communicated through guiding documents such as internal policies, guidelines, manuals, and codes. All employees must follow these policies and guidelines.
The company applies different processes to assess and identify the main risks relating to financial reporting misstatements. The risk assessments are regularly performed to identify new risks and follow up that internal control is improved over previously identified risks.
Identified risks are managed through the control activities in the company, which are documented in processes and internal control descriptions on the Company, Division, Business area, and Group levels. These aim

PROCESSES AND TOOLS

PROKURA Prokura is the delegation of the authority to act both with respect to a third party and internally. It defines how responsibility is allocated to positions and, reflecting this, to individuals. FREQUENCY: When a person is recruited to a new position
BUSINESS BOARD The internal board structure, organized according to operational responsibilities (i.e. parallel to the legal company board structure), and Company Review Meetings between local management and responsible division management are essential tools to follow up the adherence to internal policies, guidelines, instructions and codes as well as the efficiency in the control activities over financial reporting. FREQUENCY: 3­4 times per year

REPORTING
Monthly operative reports are prepared to measure and analyze profitability per product category, company, business line, division, and business area. Each division consolidates its units and reports adjustments and eliminations. Quarterly, these reports are completed with additional information and specifications. The reports constitute the basis for the Group's quarterly and annual consolidated reports. Reporting is also prepared to measure progress in fields related to environmental and social performance.
The Group uses a common system for consolidation of the reports, which also provides certain system-based validation reports. It includes a series of standardized scorecards used to analyze and follow up key indicators and trends in relation to the set targets.
FREQUENCY: Monthly, quarterly, annually
BUSINESS CONTROL
Each unit has a business controller responsible for ensuring adequate internal control processes over financial reporting, implementing Group control processes. The controller is also responsible for ensuring the application of The Way We Do Things and that reporting is correct, complete, and delivered on time. There are also controllers at the Division, Business area, and Group levels with corresponding responsibilities for these aggregated levels.
FREQUENCY: Continuously

THE YEAR IN REVIEW ­ ADMINISTRATION REPORT

to prevent, detect and correct errors and non-compliances and include for example instructions for attests and authority to pay, controls in business systems as well as accounting and business reporting processes.
The company has information and communication channels designed to ensure that information is identified, captured and communicated in a form and timeframe that enable employees and managers to carry out their responsibilities. Reporting instructions and accounting guidelines are communicated to personnel concerned in the internal database The Way We Do Things, supported by, for example, training programs for different categories of employees.
The company continuously monitors the adherence to internal policies, guidelines, manuals, and codes as well as efficiency in the control activities. Internal control is continuously evaluated and followed up on in the operations, including regular management reviews and supervisory activities as

well as through internal audits, and control self assessments. The Audit Committee has an important role in supporting the Board of Directors to monitor whether the internal control processes facilitate adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Activities in 2014 In 2014, the Group internal audit function conducted internal audits in 113 (107) units out of 511 (452). The audits were conducted in 46 countries. A risk-based internal audit plan was executed. The majority of the internal audits were conducted under leadership of Group internal audit staff with audit team members having competences in accounting, controlling, purchasing, marketing, human resources, legal, etc. Internal audits covered units' relevant processes, with additional focus on human resources and IT security. IT security audits were carried out by the Group IT Security function and covered 53 (61) units.

Focus in 2015 In 2015, the Group internal audit function will continue its work to review processes and tools with focus on risks, controls and governance as well as recommending leading practices.

PROCESSES AND TOOLS

INTERNAL AUDITS
The Internal Audit process is intended to add value to each operational unit by providing an independent and objective assurance and consulting function as well as to identify and recommend improvements. Further, the process aims to serve as a tool for employee professional development and to identify and recommend leading practices within the Group.
Internal audits are annually planned or initiated by the Group internal audit function with a risk-based approach. This includes for example when there is a change of General Manager in a company, after major negative events or structural changes, remarks from external auditors, when a new company is formed or acquired, or if a long time has passed since the last audit. Internal audits are normally performed by an inter-disciplinary team of people appointed from the organization.
Atlas Copco has operations in several complex markets, where the risk of human rights abuses and corruption is high. Therefore, the adherence to the Business Code of Practice is evaluated in the internal audit process, including environmental aspects and business partner relationships.
FREQUENCY: All units at least once every five years
CONTROL SELF ASSESSMENT
The objective of this process is primarily to support local unit managers evaluating the status of their control routines and to address weak areas. One of the areas is internal control, which includes internal control over financial reporting. Other areas include legal issues, communication and branding, and the Business Code of Practice. On Group level the aggregated assessments of the control routines give a base for improvement of Group processes, instructions, etc.
FREQUENCY: Annually

HOTLINE
The Group has a process where employees and other stakeholders can report on behavior or actions that are possible violations of laws or of Group policies, including violation of accounting and financial reporting guidelines and policies. This also includes perceived cases of human rights violation, discrimination or corruption. This process serves as a complement to similar procedures that exist on country level in certain countries. The reports are treated confidentially and the person who is reporting is guaranteed anonymity. There have been efforts to increase awareness of this process among all employees and managers, e.g. through training in the Business Code of Practice and fraud awareness.
FREQUENCY: As required
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
In the compliance process Group Management, divisional managements and all managers responsible for an operational or holding unit and certain other key positions are requested to sign a statement confirming compliance to the Business Code of Practice and applicable laws and regulations.
FREQUENCY: Annually

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP

1. Significant accounting principles, accounting estimates and judgments

Significant accounting principles The consolidated financial statements comprise Atlas Copco AB, the Parent Company ("the Company"), and its subsidiaries (together "the Group" or Atlas Copco) and the Group's interest in associated companies. Atlas Copco AB is headquartered in Nacka, Sweden.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU. The statements are also prepared in accordance with the Swedish recommendation RFR 1 "Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups" and applicable statements issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. These require certain additional disclosure requirements for Swedish consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting principles set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated, and for all entities included in the consolidated financial statements. The Annual Report for the Group and for Atlas Copco AB, including financial statements, was approved for issuance on February 13, 2015. The balance sheets and income statements are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders on April 28, 2015.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the acquisition method. Accordingly, business combinations are seen as if the Group directly acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity acquired. The consolidated income statements and balance sheets of the Group include all entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, has control. Control exists when the Company has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Generally, control and hence consolidation is based on ownership. In a few exceptions, consolidation is based on agreements that give the Group control over an entity. See note A22 for information on the Group's subsidiaries.
Intra-group balances and internal income and expense arising from intra-group transactions are fully eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions that are recognized in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full, but losses only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Business combinations At the acquisition date, the date on which control is obtained, each identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized at its acquisitiondate fair value. The consideration transferred includes assets transferred by the Group, liabilities to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Any subsequent change in such fair value is recognized in profit or loss, unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity. Trans actions costs that the Group incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Non-controlling interest is initially measured either · at fair value, or · at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the fair value
of identifiable net assets.
Subsequent profit or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest is allocated to the non-controlling interest, even if it puts the non-controlling interest in a deficit position. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are recognized as a transaction between equity attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests. The difference between consideration paid and the proportionate share of net assets acquired is recognized in equity. For details on the acquisitions made during the year, see note 2.

Associated companies An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over financial and operating policies. When the Group holds 20­50% of the voting power, it is presumed that significant influence exists, unless otherwise demonstrated. Investments in associated companies are reported according to the equity method. This means that the carrying value of interests in an associate corresponds to the Group's share of reported equity of the associate, any goodwill, and any other remaining fair value adjustments recognized at acquisition date.
"Shares of profit in associated companies", included in the income statements, comprises the Group's share of the associate's income after tax adjusted for any amortization and depreciation, impairment losses, and other adjustments arising from any remaining fair value adjustments recognized at acquisition date. Dividends received from an associated company reduce the carrying value of the investment.
Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest, but losses only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment of the asset. When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognize further losses unless the Group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Functional currency and foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swedish krona (SEK), which is the functional currency for Atlas Copco AB and also the presentation currency for the Group's financial reporting. Unless otherwise stated, the amounts presented are in millions Swedish krona (MSEK).
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Receivables and liabilities and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The exchange gains and losses related to receivables and payables and other operating receivables and liabilities are included in "Other operating income and expenses" and foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to other financial assets and liabilities included in "Financial income and expenses". Exchange rate differences on translation to functional currency are reported in "Other comprehensive income" in the following cases:
· translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation,
· translation of intra-group receivables from, or liabilities to, a foreign operation that in substance is part of the net investment in the foreign operation,
· cash flow hedges of foreign currency to the extent that the hedge is effective.
In the consolidation, the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated to SEK using exchanges rates at the end of the reporting period and the income statements are translated at the average rates for the reporting period. Foreign exchange differences arising on such translation are recognized in "Other comprehensive income" and are accumulated in the currency translation reserve in equity. Exchange rates for major currencies that have been used for the consolidated financial statements are shown in note 27.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, and for which discrete financial information is available. The operating results of all operating segments are reviewed regularly by the Group's President and CEO, the chief operating decision maker, to make decisions about allocation of resources to the segments and also to assess their performance. See note 4 for additional information.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and reduced for value added tax, estimated customer returns, discounts and other similar deductions. See note 4 for further information on revenue by segment and by geographical area.

Goods sold Revenue from goods sold is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, i.e. when the Group retains neither continuing right to dispose of the goods nor hold effective control of the goods sold, recovery of the consideration is probable and the amount of the revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably. When the product requires installation and this constitutes a significant part of the contract, revenue is recognized when the installation is completed. Revenue is not recorded for buy-back commitments if the substance of the agreement is that the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognized if there is significant uncertainty regarding the possible return of goods.
Services rendered Revenue from services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Where the outcome of a service contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately. When services are performed by an indeterminate number of activities over the service contract period, revenue is recognized linearly over that period.
Rental operations Rental income from rental equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the rental period. Sale of rental equipment is recognized as revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The carrying value of the rental equipment sold is recognized as cost of sales. Investments in and sales of rental equipment are included in cash flows from operating activities.
Other operating income and expenses Commissions and royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the financial substance of the agreement. Gains and losses on disposals of an item of non-current tangible and intangible assets are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. Such gains and losses are recognized within "Other operating income" and "Other operating expenses". See note 7 for additional information.
Government grants A government grant is recognized when there is a reasonable assurance that it will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to it. Government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred and are presented net of the related expense.
Financial income and expenses Interest income and interest expenses are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established. See note 8 for additional information.
Income taxes Income taxes include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are reported in profit or loss unless the underlying transaction is reported in "Other comprehensive income" or in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is reported according to the same principle.
Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method. The calculation of deferred taxes is based on differences between the values reported in the balance sheet and their valuation for taxation, which are referred to as temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses and tax credits. Temporary differences attributable to the following assets and liabilities are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition (other than in business combinations) of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future, and for which the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.

A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. In the calculation of deferred taxes, enacted or substantively enacted tax rates are used for the individual tax jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. For details regarding taxes, see note 9.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent and the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding. Dilutive effects arise from stock options that are settled in shares, or that at the employees' choice can be settled in shares or cash in the share based incentive programs.
Stock options have a dilutive effect when the average share price during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options. When calculating the dilutive effect, the exercise price is adjusted by the value of future services related to the options. If options for which employees can choose settlement in shares or cash are dilutive, the profit for the year is adjusted for the difference between cash-settled and equity-settled treatment of options and the more dilutive of cash settlement and share settlement is used in calculating earnings per share. See note 11 for more details.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is recognized at cost, as established at the date of acquisition of a business (see "Business combinations"), less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Impairment testing is made at least annually or whenever the need is indicated. The impairment test is performed at the level on which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The four business areas of Atlas Copco's operations have been identified as CGUs. Goodwill is reported as an indefinite useful life intangible asset.
Technology-based intangible assets Expenditure on research activities is expensed as incurred. Research projects acquired as part of business combinations are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, these research projects are carried at cost less amortization and impairment losses. Expenditure on development activities are expensed as incurred unless the activities meet the criteria for being capitalized i.e.:
· the product or process being developed is estimated to be technically and commercially feasible, and
· the Group has the intent and ability to complete and sell or use the product or process.
The expenditure capitalized includes the cost of materials, direct labor, and other costs directly attributable to the project. Capitalized development expenditure is carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
Trademarks Trademarks acquired by the Group are capitalized based on their fair value at the time of acquisition. Certain trademarks are estimated to have an indefinite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. They are tested at least annually for impairment. Other trademarks, which have finite useful lives, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
Marketing and customer related intangible assets Acquired marketing and customer related intangibles are capitalized based on their fair value at the time of acquisition and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

Other intangible assets Acquired intangible assets relating to contract-based rights, such as licenses or franchise agreements, are capitalized based on their fair value at the time of acquisition and carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and similar items is expensed as incurred. Changes in the Group's intangible assets during the year are described in note 12.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price, import duties, and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition for use. Borrowing cost for assets that need a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are included in the cost value until the assets are substantially ready for their use or sale and are thereafter depreciated. The Group capitalizes costs on initial recognition and on replacement of significant parts of property, plant and equipment if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognized as an expense in profit or loss when incurred.
Rental equipment The rental fleet is comprised of diesel and electric powered air compressors, generators, air dryers, and to a lesser extent general construction equipment. Rental equipment is initially recognized at cost and is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the equipment. Rental equipment is depreciated to a residual value estimated at 0­10% of cost.
Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization is calculated based on cost using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Parts of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item are depreciated separately when the useful lives of the parts do not coincide with the useful lives of other parts of the item. The following useful lives are used for depreciation and amortization:

Technology-based intangible assets Trademarks with definite lives Marketing and customer related intangible assets Buildings Machinery and equipment Vehicles Computer hardware and software Rental equipment

3­15 years 5­15 years 5­10 years 25­50 years 3­10 years
4­5 years 3­10 years 3­8 years

The useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Land, assets under construction, goodwill, and trademarks with indefinite lives are not depreciated or amortized. For changes in the Group's property, plant and equipment see note 13.
Leasing The Group acts both as lessor and lessee. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A finance lease entails the transfer to the lessee of substantially all of the economic risks and benefits associated with ownership. If this is not the case, the lease is accounted for as an operating lease.
Group as lessee For the lessee, a financial lease implies that the fixed asset leased is recognized as an asset in the balance sheet. Initially, a corresponding liability is recorded. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Fixed assets under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while the lease payments are reported as interest and amortization of the lease liability. For operating leases, the lessee does not account for the leased asset in its balance sheet. The costs of operating leases are recorded in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Group as lessor In cases where the Group acts as the lessor under an operating lease, the asset is classified as rental equipment and is subject to the Group's depreciation policies. The lease payments are included in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Under finance leases where the Group acts as lessor, the transaction is recorded as a sale and a lease receivable, comprising the future minimum lease payments and any residual value guaranteed to the lessor, is recorded. Lease payments are recognized as interest income and repayment of the lease receivable. See note 22 for more details on leases.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying values of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at least at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped in CGUs, which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss related to goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses in prior periods are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are recognized according to the first-in-first-out principle and includes the cost of acquiring inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. Inventories manufactured by the Group and work in progress include an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Inventories are reported net of deductions for obsolescence and internal profits arising in connection with deliveries from the production companies to the customer centers. See note 16 for more details.
Equity Shares issued by the Company are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effect.
When share capital recognized as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity net of any tax effect. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or subsequently reissued, the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from other paid-in capital.
Provisions Provisions are recognized: · when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation (as a result of
a past event), · it is probable that the Group will have to settle the obligation, and · the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of estimated expenditures.
Provisions for product warranties are recognized as cost of sales at the time the products are sold based on the estimated cost using historical data for level of repairs and replacements.
A restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized as

provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the asset associated with the contract. For details on provisions see note 25.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefit plans are classified either as defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. Contributions to defined contributions plans are expensed when employees provide services entitling them to the contribution.
Other post-employment benefit plans are defined benefit plans and it is the Group's obligation to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods. The amount is discounted to determine its present value and the fair values of any plan assets are deducted. Funded plans with net assets, i.e. plans with assets exceeding the commitments, are reported as financial non-current assets.
The cost for defined benefit plans is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which distributes the cost over the employee's service period. The calculation is performed annually by independent actuaries using actuarial assumptions such as employee turnover, mortality, future increase in salaries and medical cost. Changes in actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments of obligations and changes in fair value of plan assets result in remeasurements and are recognized in other comprehensive income. Each quarter a remeasurement is performed to adjust the present value of pension liabilities and the fair value of pension assets against "Other comprehensive income". Net interest on defined benefit obligations and plan assets is reported as interest income or interest expenses. See note 23 for additional information.
Share-based compensation The Group has share-based incentive programs, consisting of share options and share appreciation rights, which have been offered to certain employees based on position and performance. Additionally, the Board is offered synthetic shares.
The fair value of share options that can only be settled in shares (equity-settled) is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value, measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes formula, is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights, synthetic shares, and options with a choice for employees to settle in shares or cash is recognized in accordance with principles for cash-settled share-based payments. The value is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value, measured at grant date and remeasured at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes formula, is accrued and recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Changes in fair value are, during the vesting period and after the vesting period until settlement, recognized in profit or loss as an employee expense. The accumulated expense recognized equals the cash amount paid at settlement.
Social security charges are paid in cash and are accounted for in consistence with the principles for cash-settled share-based payments, regardless of whether they are related to equity- or cash-settled share-based payments. See note 23 for details.
Financial assets and liabilities ­ financial instruments Recognition and derecognition Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Transactions of financial assets are accounted for at trade date, which is the day when the Group contractually commits to acquire or dispose of the assets. Trade receivables are recognized on issuance of invoices. Liabilities are recognized when the other party has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay. Derecognition, fully or partially, of a financial asset occurs when the rights in the contract have been realized or mature, or when the

Group no longer has control over it. A financial liability is derecognized, fully or partially, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or otherwise expires.
A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when there is a legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to either settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement of financial instruments Financial instruments are measured, classified and recognized according to IAS 39 in the following categories:
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories · Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss · Loans and receivables · Held-to-maturity investments · Assets available for sale
The Group classifies its financial liabilities in the following categories: · Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss · Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: This category includes financial assets and liabilities held for trading or are designated as such upon initial recognition. A financial asset or liability is held for trading if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value. A derivative that is not designated or effective as hedging instrument is also categorized as held for trading. Financial instruments in this category are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 27.
Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in an active market, such as trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Held-to-maturity investments: Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity-investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses.
Available-for-sale financial assets: This category consists of nonderivatives that are either designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as any of above categories. These assets are measured at fair value. Changes therein are recognized in "Other comprehensive income", except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on availablefor-sale monetary items which are recognized in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 27.
Other financial liabilities: Other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade payables and loan liabilities are recognized in this category.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, except those classified as fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flow of the investment has been affected negatively. The impairment is made on an individual basis for significant financial assets and in some cases collectively in groups with similar credit risks. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For financial assets measured at amortized cost and availablefor-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized

in profit or loss. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized in other comprehensive income.

required to settle the obligation or that a sufficiently reliable calculation of the amount cannot be made.

Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item hedged. Changes in fair value for derivatives that do not fulfill the criteria for hedge accounting are recognized as operating or financial transactions based on the purpose of the use of the derivative. Interest payments for interest swaps are recognized as interest income or expense, whereas changes in fair value of future payments are presented as gains or losses from financial instruments.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must be
· formally designated, · expected to be highly effective, and · documented.
The Group assesses, evaluates, and documents effectiveness both at hedge inception and on an on-going basis.

New or amended accounting standards in 2014 The following revised and amended IFRS standards have been applied by the Group from 2014.
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The standard clarifies existing application issues relating to the requirements for offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has not had any material effects for the Group.
"The package of five" IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (Revised 2011) and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Revised 2011) are called "The package of five" in EU. The group has reviewed its investments in other entities to assess whether the conclusion to consolidate is different under IFRS 10 than under IAS 27. No differences were found for any of the investments, therefore these standards have not had any impact on the consolidated financial statements, except for additional disclosures.

Fair value hedges: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps used for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings.

Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting This amendment allows the continuation of hedge accounting when a derivative is novated to a clearing counterparty and certain conditions are met. The amendment has not had any impact for the Group.

Cash flow hedges: Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective and the accumulated changes in fair value are recognized as a separate component in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ineffective part of hedges are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The amount recognized in equity through Other comprehensive income is reversed to profit or loss in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the amount previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or liability. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group uses foreign currency forwards to hedge part of the future cash flows from forecasted transactions in foreign currencies. Interest rate swaps are also used as cash flow hedges for hedging interest on borrowings with variable interest.

New or amended accounting standards effective after 2014 The following standards, interpretations, and amendments have been issued but were not effective as of December 31, 2014 and have not been applied by the Group. The assessment of the effect that the implementation of these standards and interpretations could have on the consolidated financial statements is preliminary.
Improvements to IFRSs 2010­2012 and IFRSs 2011­2013 issued in December 2013 The improvements include a number of amendments to various IFRSs. The improvements are not expected to have any material impact for the Group.
Amendments to IAS 19 (2011) issued in November 2013 The amendments permit contributions that are independent of the number of years of service to be recognized as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the service is rendered. The improvements are not expected to have any material impact for the Group.

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations: The Group hedges a substantial part of net investments in foreign operations. Changes in the value of the hedge instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss. On divestment of foreign operations, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recycled through profit or loss, increasing or decreasing the profit or loss on the divestment. The Group uses loans and forward contracts as hedging instruments.
Asset held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their value, within one year, will be recovered through a sale and not through continued use in the operations. On the reclassification date, assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of fair value less selling expenses and the carrying amount. Following reclassification, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized. Gains and losses recognized on remeasurements and disposals are reported in profit or loss.
Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not reported as a liability or provision, due either to that it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be

Amendment to IFRS 5 ­ Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discountinued Operations ­ Changes in methods of disposal* The amendment clarifies guidance to have consistent criteria and accounting requirements for an asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale and for an asset (or disposal group) classified as held for distribution to owners. There is no change in the method of evaluation and reclassification.
Amendment to IFRS 7 ­ Financial Instruments Disclosures ­ Servicing contracts* The amendment proposes to add guidance that clarifies how to apply disclosure requirements for servicing contracts that constitute continuing involvement of transferred financial assets.
Amendment to IFRS 7 ­ Financial Instruments Disclosures ­ Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements* The amendment proposes to clarify that the additional disclosure required by the amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosure­Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities is not specifically required for all interim periods, except when additional disclosure is required to be given in condensed interim financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34.

Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization issued in May 2014* The amendment is not expected to have any material impact for the Group.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits ­ Discount rate: regional market issue* The amendments determine to use the discount rate by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds for the countries where there is no deep market in such bonds. The amendment substitutes the word "countries" by "currencies".
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments* The standard is intended to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements, and addresses the classification and measurement of financial instruments and hedge accounting. It is likely to affect the Group's accounting of financial assets and financial liabilities. The effective date is January 1, 2018 and the Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ­ Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture issued in September 2014* The amendment is not expected to have any material impact for the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued in May 2014* This new standard that replaces existing revenue recognition standards specifies how and when the Group will recognize revenue as well as requiring the Group to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The effective date is January 1, 2017. The assessment of the effect on the revenue recognition is under investigation.
IFRIC 21 Levies The interpretation addresses when a liability to pay a levy to a government should be recognized. The Interpretation has not had any impact for the Group.
* Indicates that the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of financial reports requires management's judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions that affects the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Actual result may differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the period which they are revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and the judgments which, in the opinion of management, are significant to the underlying amounts included in the financial reports and for which there is a significant risk that future events or new information could entail a change in those estimates or judgments are as follows:
Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets Key sources of estimation uncertainty Goodwill and certain trademarks are not amortized but are subject to annual tests for impairment. Other intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue but are also reviewed regularly for indications of impairment. The impairment tests are based on a review of the recoverable amount, which is estimated based on management's projections of future cash flows using internal business plans and forecasts.

Accounting judgment Asset impairment requires management's judgment, particularly in assessing: ­ whether an event has occurred that may affect asset values, ­ whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the net
present value of future cash flows, which are estimated based upon the continued use of the asset in the business, ­ the appropriate assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow projections, and ­ the discounting of these cash flows.
Changing the assumptions selected by management to determine the level, if any, of impairment could affect the financial position and results of operation. See note 12.
Pension and other post-employment benefit valuation assumptions Key sources of estimation uncertainty Pensions and other post-employment obligations are dependent on the assumptions established by management and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. The key assumptions include discount rates, inflation, future salary increases, mortality rates, and health care cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and are changed when it is deemed appropriate.
See note 23 for additional information regarding assumptions used in the calculation of pension and post-employment obligations.
Trade and financial receivable Key sources of estimation uncertainty The Group estimates the risk that receivables will not be paid and provides for doubtful accounts based on specific provisions for known cases and collective provisions for losses based on historical loss levels.
Accounting judgment Management's judgment considers rapidly changing market conditions which may be particularly sensitive in customer financing operations. Additional information is included in section "Credit risk" in note 27.
Inventory Accounting judgment The Group values inventory at the lower of historical cost, based on the first-in, first-out basis, and net realizable value. The calculation of net realizable value involves management's judgment as to the estimated sales prices, over-stock articles, out-dated articles, damaged goods, and selling costs. If the estimated net realizable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for inventory obsolescence. See note 16 for additional information.
Legal proceedings and tax claims Accounting judgment Atlas Copco recognizes a liability when the Group has an obligation from a past event involving the transfer of economic benefits and when a reasonable estimate can be made of what the transfer might be. The Group reviews outstanding legal cases regularly in order to assess the need for provisions in the financial statements. These reviews consider the factors of the specific case by internal legal counsel and through the use of outside legal counsel and advisors when necessary. The financial statements may be affected to the extent that management's assessments of the factors considered are not consistent with the actual outcome.
Additionally, the legal entities of the Group are frequently subject to audits by tax authorities in accordance with standard practice in the countries where the Group operates. In instances where the tax authorities have a different view on how to interpret the tax legislation, the Group makes estimates as to the likelihood of the outcome of the dispute, as well as estimates of potential claims. The actual results may differ from these estimates.

Deferred taxes Key sources of estimation uncertainty Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes and for tax loss carry-forwards. The Group records deferred tax assets based upon management's estimates of future taxable profit in different tax jurisdictions. The actual results may differ from these estimates, due to change in the business climate and change in tax legislation. See note 9.
Revenue recognition Key sources of estimation uncertainty Revenue from services is recognized in profit or loss by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The stage of completion is determined based on the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction.

Warranty provisions Key sources of estimation uncertainty Provisions for product warranties should cover future commitments for the sales volumes already realized. Warranty provision is a complex accounting estimate due to the variety of variables which are included in the calculations. The calculation methods are based on the type of products sold and historical data for level of repairs and replacements. The underlying estimates for calculating the provision is reviewed at least quarterly as well as when new products are being introduced or when other changes occur which may affect the calculation. See note 25.

Accounting judgment Management's judgment is used, for instance, when assessing: ­ if the risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer, to deter-
mine if revenue and cost should be recognized in the current period, ­ the degree of completion of service contracts and the estimated
total costs for such contracts, to determine the revenue and cost to be recognized in the current period and whether any losses need to be recognized, and ­ the customer credit risk (i.e. the risk that the customer will not meet the payment obligation), to determine and justify the revenue recognized in the current period.

All acquisitions in 2014 were made through the purchase of 100 % of shares and voting rights or through the purchase of the net assets of the acquired operations. The Group received control over the operations upon the date of acquisition. No equity instruments have been issued in connection with the acquisitions. All acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method.
The amounts presented in the following tables detail the recognized amounts aggregated by business area, as the relative amounts of the individual acquisitions are not considered significant. The fair values related to intangible assets are amortized over 5­15 years. For those acquisitions that include a contingent consideration clause, the fair value of the contingent consideration has been calculated based on a discount rate of 10.5 %. The Group is in the process of reviewing the final values for the acquired businesses. No adjustments are expected to be material. Minor adjustments related to the acquisitions made in 2013 are included in the following tables.

On January 9, the Compressor Technique business area closed the acquisition of the Edwards Group, headquartered in the United Kingdom. Edwards is a technology and market leader in sophisticated vacuum products and abatement solutions with more than 90 years' experience. The products and services are integral to manufacturing processes, such as for semiconductors and flat panel displays, and are used within an increasingly diverse range of industrial applications. The acquisition of Edwards offers Atlas Copco an opportunity to expand into a growing business which serves industries that are well-known to Atlas Copco. There are several synergies between vacuum and compressed air solutions in sales, service and technology development. Intangible assets of 3 933 and goodwill of 5 118 were recorded on the purchase. For more information about the acquired assets and liabilities, see page 79.
In May, U.S.-based Quincy Compressor LLC acquired the compressor business of National Pump & Compressor Ltd. and McKenzie Compressed Air Inc. National Pump & Compressor's business is located in Texas and Alabama, while McKenzie Compressed Air is focused on Texas. The businesses are focused on distribution, service and rental of compressor-related equipment for use in such areas as manufacturing, construction, petrochemical, refinery and oil fields. The acquisitions will allow Quincy Compressor to further strengthen its presence in Texas, especially in the Gulf Coast region. Intangible assets of 196 and goodwill of 108 were recorded on the purchase. The goodwill is tax deductible.
Brazilian Cavaletti Equipamentos e Servicos Ltda, a competitor dealer for the São Paulo country side area, with a strong focus on aftermarket, was also acquired in May. By introducing the Chicago Pneumatic brand to the company, the rationale for the acquisition is to extend the footprint in the Sao Paolo area. Intangible assets of 15 were recorded on the purchase.
The compressor distribution and service business from the Lancaster Group in New Zealand was acquired in September. The acquired businesses were those of Ash Air (NZ) Ltd., Fox Air NZ Ltd., MBAR 2011 Ltd. and Ash Air Oil & Gas Ltd. The businesses provide high-quality sales and service of industrial compressors and related equipment to a broad range of customers in the region. By acquiring this group of high-quality distributors, Atlas Copco further expands and strengthens its presence in New Zealand. Intangible assets of 112 and goodwill of 31 were recorded on the purchase. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

In September, the Industrial Technique business area acquired self-pierce riveting specialist Henrob, with main facilities in the U.S. and the U.K. Henrob is a pioneer and market leader in self-pierce riveting, a mechanical fastening process for joining two or more sheets of material where welding is difficult, e.g. aluminum, and the acquisition offers Atlas Copco an opportunity to expand in a fast-growing market segment, with state-of-the art technology. Intangible assets of 1 332 and goodwill of 1 802 were recorded on the purchase. The goodwill is not tax deductible.
U.S.A.-based Titan Technologies International Inc., a provider of powerful bolting tools to the oil and gas and other industries, was acquired in December. The acquisition expands Atlas Copco's offerings of superior bolting solutions to more customers in segments like oil and gas and power generation. Intangible assets of 16 were recorded on the purchase.
Total consideration was 3 170. This includes deferred consideration for this year's acquisitions amounting to 2 177. Of the deferred consideration, 794 represent the fair value of a deferred contingent consideration related to the Henrob acquisition. The payment of the contingent consideration is dependent on achieving future milestones related to targets for revenue and growth within three years of the acquisition, in total a maximum of MUSD 129 (MSEK 917). The fair value has been calculated based on the expectation that the maximum amount will be paid out. The remaining deferred consideration related to Henrob was paid in January 2015.

In February, the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area acquired Swedish Geawelltech, a former Atlas Copco distributor that sells, rents out and manufactures well- and geotechnical drilling equipment. Ground engineering is a strategic segment and the acquisition fits with the existing Atlas Copco product portfolio. Intangible assets of 14 and goodwill of 13 were recorded on the purchase. The goodwill is not tax deductible.

* The gross amount is 1 459 (240) of which 33 (0) is expected to be uncollectible.

The goodwill recognized on acquisitions is primarily related to the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating these companies into the Group's existing structure.
The total consideration for all acquisitions was 11 497. Total consideration includes deferred consideration not yet paid for acquisitions made in 2014 and settlement of deferred consideration for acquisitions made in prior years. For all acquisitions, the net cash outflow totaled 8 415 after deducting cash and cash equivalents acquired of 990.
Acquisition-related costs amounted to 20 (57) and were included in "Administrative expenses" in the income statement for 2014. Costs related to the Edwards acquisition that was finalized in January 2014 were included in the income statement for 2013.

Remuneration and other fees for members of the Board, the President and CEO, and other members of Group Management
Principles for remuneration to the Board and Group Management The principles for remuneration to the Board and Group Management are approved at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders. The principles approved by the 2014 meeting are described in the following paragraphs.
Board members Remuneration and fees are based on the work performed by the Board. The remuneration and fees approved for 2014 are detailed in the table on the previous page. The remuneration to the President and CEO, who is a member of Group Management, is described in the following sections.
The Annual General Meeting decided that each board member can elect to receive 50% of the 2014 gross fee before tax, excluding other committee fees, in the form of synthetic shares and the remaining part in cash. The number of synthetic shares is based upon an average end price of series A shares during ten trading days following the release of the first quarterly interim report for 2014. The share rights are earned 25% per quarter as long as the member remains on the Board. After five years, the synthetic shares give the right to receive a cash payment per synthetic share based upon an average price for series A shares during 10 trading days following the release of the first quarterly interim report of the year of payment. The board members will receive dividends on series A shares until payment date in the form of new synthetic shares. If a board member resigns his or her position before the stipulated payment date as stated above, the board member has the right to request a prepayment. The prepayment will be made twelve months after the date from when the board member resigned or otherwise the original payment date is valid.
Five board members accepted the right to receive synthetic shares. The number and costs at grant date and at the end of the financial year are disclosed by board member in the table on the previous page.
Group Management Group Management consists of the Group President and eight other members of the Executive Comittee. The compensation to Group Management shall consist of base salary, variable compensation, possible long term incentive (personnel options), pension premium, and other benefits.
The following describes the various guidelines in determining the amount of remuneration: · Base salary is determined by position, qualification, and individual
performance. · Variable compensation is dependent upon how certain quantitative and
qualitative goals set in advance are achieved. The variable compensation is maximized to 70% of the base salary for the Group President, 50% for Business Area Presidents, and 40% for other members of Group Management. · Performance related personnel option program for 2014, see note 23. · Pension premiums are paid in accordance with a defined contribution plan with premiums ranging between 25 and 35% of base salary depending on age. · Other benefits consist of company car and private health insurance. · For the expatriates, certain benefits are paid in compliance with the Atlas Copco terms and conditions for expatriate employment. · A mutual notice of termination of employment of six months shall apply.
The Board has the right to deviate from the principles stated above if special circumstances exist in a certain case. No fees are paid to Group Management for board memberships in Group companies nor do they receive compensation for other duties that they may perform outside the immediate scope of their duties.
President and CEO The variable compensation can give a maximum of 70% of the base salary. The variable compensation is not included in the basis for pension benefits. According to an agreement, the President and CEO has the option to receive variable compensation in the form of cash payment or as a pension contribution.
The President and CEO is a member of the Atlas Copco Airpower N.V. pension plan and the contributions follow the Atlas Copco pension policy for Swedish executives, which is a defined contribution plan. The President and CEO is entitled to retire at the age of 60. The contribution is age related and is 35% of the base salary and includes provisions for a survivors' pension. These pension plans are vested and are lifetime payments upon retirement.

Other members of Group Management Members of Group Management employed in Sweden have a defined contribution pension plan, with contribution ranging from 25% to 35% of the base salary according to age. The variable compensation is not included in the basis for pension benefits. Members of Group Management not based in Sweden also have a defined contribution pension plan. These pension plans are vested and are lifetime payments upon retirement. The retirement age is 65.
Option/share appreciation rights, holdings for Group Management The stock options/share appreciation rights holdings as at December 31 are detailed below:

1) Estimated grants for the 2014 stock option program including matching shares. See note 23 for additional information.

Termination of employment The CEO is entitled to a severance pay of twelve months if the Company terminates the employment and a further twelve months if other employment is not available.
Other members of Group Management are entitled to severance pay if the Company terminates their employment. The amount of severance pay is dependent on the length of employment with the Company and the age of the executive, but is never less than twelve months and never more than 24 months' salary.
Any income that the executive receives from employment or other business activity, whilst severance pay is being paid, will reduce the amount of severance pay accordingly.
Severance pay for the CEO and other members of Group Management is calculated only on the base salary and does not include variable compensation. Severance pay cannot be elected by the employee, but will only be paid if employment is terminated by the Company.
Remuneration and other committees In 2014, the Chairman of the Board, Hans Stråberg and Board Members Peter Wallenberg Jr and Anders Ullberg were members of the remuneration committee. The committee proposed compensation to the President and CEO for approval by the Board. The committee also supported the President and CEO in determining the compensation to the other members of Group Management.
Ulla Litzén, Chair, Staffan Bohman, Johan Forsell and Hans Stråberg formed the Audit Committee.
In addition, Anders Ullberg, Chair, Ulla Litzén and Hans Stråberg parti cipated in a committee regarding repurchase and sale of Atlas Copco shares.
Deviation from by the general meeting approved principles for remuneration to Group Management In 2014 a deviation has been made from the principles for remuneration to Group Management. In connection with the mutual consent termination of a member of Group Management, it was agreed that the 18 months' severance payment should not be reduced with income from new employment, which is a deviation from the approved principles. Due to certain aspects of the law applicable to the employment contract it was considered favorable for Atlas Copco to make this deviation including a legally enforceable non-compete obligation.
Proposed change in the guidelines for remuneration to Group Management The Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting 2015 a change in the guidelines for remuneration to Group Management on the following: · Variable compensation is dependent upon how certain quantitative and
qualitative goals set in advance are achieved. The variable compensation is maximized to 80% of the base salary for the Group President, 60% for Business Area Presidents, and 50% for other members of Group Management.

The effective tax rate was 24.3% (25.7). Withholding tax on dividends of ­49 (­172) relates to provisions on profits in countries where Atlas Copco incurs withholding taxes on repatriation of income. Tax-exempt income of 1 420 (1 304) refers to income that is not subject to taxation or subject to reduced taxation under local law in various countries. The net from tax issues and disputes in different countries amounted to ­100 (­243).
Previously unrecognized tax losses/credits and deductible temporary differences, which have been recognized against current tax expense, amounted to 15 (7). No material unrecognized tax losses/credits or temporary difference have been used to reduce deferred tax expense.

The following table reconciles the net liability balance of deferred taxes at the beginning of the year to the net liability at the end of the year:

Deferred tax assets regarding tax loss carry-forwards are reported to the extent that realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable results is probable. At December 31, the Group had total tax loss carry-forwards of 4 079 (3 347), of which deferred tax assets were recognized for 861 (729). The tax value of reported tax loss carry-forwards totals 220 (184). There is no expiration date for utilization of the major part of the tax losses carry-forwards for which deferred tax assets have been recognized. An important part of tax loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized have no expiration date.

Changes in temporary differences during the year that are recognized in the income statement are attributable to the following:

Intangible assets Property, plant and equipment Other financial assets Inventories Current receivables Operating liabilities Provisions Post-employment benefits Borrowings Other items Changes due to temporary differences Loss/credit carry-forwards Charges to profit for the year

Potentially dilutive instruments As of December 31, 2014, Atlas Copco had six outstanding employee stock option programs, of which the exercise price for the 2012 and 2014 programs exceeded the average share price for series A shares, SEK 196 per share. These programs are, therefore, considered anti-dilutive and are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. If the average share price exceeds the strike price in the future, these options will be dilutive.

12. Intangible assets

Impairment tests for cash-generating units with goodwill and for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives Impairment tests (including sensitivity analyses) are performed as per September 30 each year.
Current goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes at business area level. The goodwill has therefore been tested for impairment at business area level except as stated below.
Businesses acquired in 2014 as well as those in previous years, and their related cash flows, have in most cases been integrated with other Atlas Copco operations soon after the acquisition. In instances where the acquired business would not be integrated or has not yet been integrated and hence be monitored separately, the associated goodwill is tested for impairment separately. Atlas Copco acquired Edwards Group January 9, 2014. Goodwill and intangible assets have been included in the Compressor Technique values, and this year their values have been tested separately.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been calculated as value in use based on management's five-year forecast for net cash flows where the most significant assumptions are revenues, operating profits, working capital, and capital expenditures.
All assumptions for the five-year forecast are estimated individually for each of the business areas based on their particular market position and the characteristics and development of their end markets. The forecasts represent management's assessment and are based on both external and internal sources. The perpetual growth for the period after five years is estimated at 3%. The Group's average weighted cost of capital in 2014 was 8% (8) after tax (approximately 10.5% (10.5) before tax) and has been used in discounting the cash flows to determine the recoverable amounts.

23. Employee benefits
Post-employment benefits Atlas Copco provides post-employment defined benefits pensions and other long- term employee benefits in most of its major locations. The most significant countries in terms of size of plans are Belgium, Canada, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Some plans are funded in advance with certain assets or funds held separately from the Group for future benefit payment obligations. Other plans are unfunded and the benefits from those plans are paid by the Group as they fall due.
The plans in Belgium cover early retirement, jubilee, and termination indemnity. All of the plans are unfunded.
In Canada, Atlas Copco provides a pension plan and a supplemental retirement pension benefit plan for executives. Both plans are funded. There are also two unfunded plans, a post-retirement benefit plan and a postemployment plan.
The German plans include those for pensions, early retirements and jubilee. The plans are funded as of 2013.
There are three defined benefit pension plans in Sweden. The ITP plan is a final salary pension plan covering the majority of white collar employees in Sweden. Atlas Copco finances the benefits through a pension foundation. The second plan relates to a group of employees earning more than ten income base amounts that has opted out from the ITP plan. This plan is insured. The third defined benefit pension plan relates to former senior employees now retired. In Sweden, in addition to benefits relating to retirement pensions, Atlas Copco has obligations for family pensions for many of the Swedish employees, which are funded through a third party insurer, Alecta. This plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan as sufficient information is not available for calculating the net pension obligation.

In the United Kingdom, there is a final salary pension plan. This plan is funded. In 2010, the plan was converted to a defined contribution plan for future services.
In the United States, Atlas Copco provides a pension plan, a post-retirement medical plan, and a number of supplemental retirement pension benefits for executives. The pension plan is funded while the other plans are unfunded.
The Group identifies a number of risks in investments of pension plan assets. The main risks are interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity and inflation risk, and currency risk. The Group is working on a regular basis to handle the risks and has a long term investment horizon. The investment portfolio should be diversified, which means that multiple assets classes, markets and issuers should be utilized. An asset liability management assessment should be conducted periodically. The study should include a number of elements. The most important elements are, the duration of the assets and the timing of liabilities, the expected return of the assets, the expected development of liabilities, the forecasted cash flows and the impact of a shift in interest rates on the obligation.
The net obligations for post-employment benefits and other long-term employee benefits have been recorded in the balance sheet as follows:

The Group has identified discount rate, future salary increases, and mortality as the primary actuarial assumptions for determining defined benefit obligations. Changes in those actuarial assumptions affect the present value of the net obligation. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date using, if available, high quality corporate bonds (AAA or AA) matching the duration of the pension obligations. In countries where corporate bonds are not available, government bonds are used to determine the discount rate. In Sweden in line with prior years, mortgage bonds are used for determining the discount rate.
Atlas Copco's mortality assumptions are set by country, based on the most recent mortality studies that are available. Where possible, generational mortality assumptions are used, meaning that they include expected improvements in life expectancy over time.
The table below shows the sensitivity analysis for discount rate and increase in life expectancy and describes the potential effect on the present value of the defined pension obligation.

23. Employee benefits, continued

Share value based incentive programs In 2009­2013, the Annual General Meeting decided on performance based personnel stock option programs based on a proposal from the Board on an option program for the respective years. In 2014, the Annual General Meeting decided on a performance based personnel stock option program for 2014 similar to the 2009­2013 programs.
Option programs 2009­2014 At the Annual General Meeting 2009­2014 respectively, it was decided to implement performance related personnel stock option programs. The decision to grant options was made in April each year and the options were issued in March the following year (issue date). The number of options issued each program year depended on the value creation in the Group, measured as Economic Value Added (EVA), for the respective program year. For the 2014 option program, the number of options varies on a linear basis within a preset EVA interval. The size of the plan and the limits of the interval have been established by the Board and have been approved by the Annual General Meeting and are compatible with the long term business plan of the Group.
In connection to the issue, the exercise price was calculated as 110% of the average trading price for series A shares during a ten day period following the date of the publishing of the fourth quarter report. The options were issued without compensation paid by the employee and the options remain the property of the employee only to the extent that they are exercisable at the time employment is terminated. The 2009 program has a term of five years from the issue date and the options are not transferable. The 2010­2014 programs have a term of five years from the grant date and the options are not transferable. The options in the program 2009 is exercisable at a rate of one third per year, starting one year after the issue date. The options in the 2010­2014 programs become exercisable at 100% three years after grant.
The 2010­2014 programs include a requirement for senior executives (31 in total) to purchase Atlas Copco A shares for 10% of their gross base salary in order to be granted options. A lower amount of investment will reduce the number of options proportionately. Further, senior executives who have invested in Atlas Copco A shares will have the option to purchase one matching share per each share purchased at a price equal to 75% of the average trading price for series A shares during a ten day period following the date of the publishing of the fourth quarter report. This right applies from three years after grant until the expiration of the stock option program.
The Board had the right to decide to implement an alternative incentive solution (SARs) for key persons in such countries where the grant of personnel options was not feasible.
In the 2009­2014 programs, the options may, on request by an optionee in Sweden, be settled by the Company paying cash equal to the excess of the closing price of the shares over the exercise price on the exercise day, less any administrative fees. Due to this choice of settlement by the Swedish employees, these options are classified for accounting purposes as cash-settled in accordance with IFRS 2.

The Black-Scholes model is used to calculate the fair value of the options/ SARs in the programs at issue date. Since the issue date for the 2014 program will be in March 2015, the fair value has been simulated through a Monte Carlo model of what it may be established at in March 2015. For the programs in 2013 and 2014, the fair value of the options/SARs was based on the following assumptions:

Key assumptions

The expected volatility has been determined by analyzing the historic development of the Atlas Copco A share price as well as other shares on the stock market.
When determining the expected option life, assumptions have been made regarding the expected exercising behavior of different categories of optionees.

For the stock options in 2009­2014 programs, the fair value is recognized as an expense over the following vesting periods:

23. Employee benefits, continued

For SARs and the options classified as cash-settled, the fair value is recognized as an expense over the same vesting period; the fair value is, however, remeasured at each reporting date and changes in the fair value after the end of the vesting period continue to be recognized as a personnel expense.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the expense in 2014 for all share-based incentive programs amounted to 141 (56) excluding social costs of which 32 (39) refers to equity-settled options. The related costs for social security contribu-

tions are accounted for in accordance with the statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (UFR 7) and are classified as personnel expenses.
In the balance sheet, the provision for share appreciation rights and stock options classified as cash-settled as of December 31 amounted to 157 (186). Atlas Copco shares are held by the Parent Company in order to cover commitments under the programs 2009­2014, see also note 20.

Financial exposure and principles 27. for control of financial risks
Capital management Atlas Copco defines capital as borrowings and equity, which at December 31 totaled 75 219 (65 386). The Group's policy is to have an adequate capital structure to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support future development of the business. The Board's opinion is that the dividend over a business cycle should correspond to about 50% of earnings per share. In recent years, the Board has also proposed, and the Annual General Meeting has approved, distributions of "excess" equity to the shareholders through share redemptions and share repurchases.
There are no external capital requirements imposed on the Group.

· The Group should maintain minimum MSEK 6 000 committed credit facilities to meet operational, strategic and rating objectives. Actual amount at year-end was MEUR 1 460 (1 440) which corresponds to MSEK13 932 (12 902).
· The average tenor (i.e. time until maturity) of the Group's external debt should be at least 3 years. Actual tenor at year-end was 5.1 years (4.4).
· No more than MSEK 5 000 of the Group's external debt may mature within the next 12 months. In 2015 no debt is maturing (4 987).
· Adequate funding at subsidiary level shall at all times be in place.
Status at year-end As per December 31, there were no deviations from the Group funding risk policy. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 9 404 (17 633). The overall liquidity of the Group is strong considering the maturity profile of the external borrowings, the balance of cash and cash equivalent as of year-end, and available back-up credit facilities from banks. Please refer to note 21 for information on utilized borrowings, maturity, and back-up facilities.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is negatively affected by changes in the interest rate levels.

Group interest rate risk policy The interest rate risk policy states that the average duration (i.e. period for which interest rates are fixed) should be a minimum of 6 months (6) and a maximum of 48 months (48).

Status at year-end To manage interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swap agreements to convert interest on loans. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert fixed interest rates to variable interest rates. These swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments, with a nominal amount of MUSD 200 (200). The Group has

also interest rate swaps to convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on the loan of MEUR 275 (275). These swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. For more information about the Group's borrowings, see note 21.
Including the effect of the derivatives, the effective interest rate and interest duration of the Group's borrowings at year-end was 3.0% (2.7) and 46 months (45) respectively. Excluding any derivatives, the Group's effective interest rate was 3.5% (3.3) and the average interest duration was 42 months (41).

The following tables show the estimated effect, in MSEK, of a parallel upward and downward shift of one percentage point (100 basis points) in all interest rates on external loans and on interest rate swaps hedging the loans.
The first table shows the estimated effect on the profit and loss before taxes. The second table shows the fair value effect on loans and interest rate swaps reported at fair value. Certain loans are reported at their amortized cost and are therefore not affected by changes in interest rate levels. For the main part of the interest rate swaps, fair value hedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting is applied, therefore the impact on earnings is small.

Currency risk The Group is present in various geographical markets and undertakes trans actions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. This affects both transaction exposure (cash flow) and translation exposure (balance sheet). These two different exposures are explained separately below.
Transaction exposure Group currency risk policy Transaction exposure risk is the risk that profitability is negatively affected by changes in exchange rates, affecting cash flows in foreign currencies in the operations. Due to the Group's presence in various markets, there are inflows and outflows in different currencies. As a normal part of business, net surpluses or deficits in specific currencies are created. The value of these net positions fluctuates with the changes in currency rates and, thus, a transaction exposure is created. The following describes the Group's general policies for managing transaction exposure: · Exposures should be reduced by matching in and outflows of the same
currencies. · Business area and divisional management are responsible for maintaining
readiness to adjust their operations (price and cost) to compensate for adverse currency movements. · Based on the assumption that hedging does not have any significant positive or negative effect on the Group's results over the long term, the policy does not recommend transaction exposures to be hedged on an ongoing basis. Business areas and divisions should normally not hedge currency risks. Hedging can, however, be motivated in case of long-term contracts where there is no possibility to adjust the contract price or the associated costs. · The FRMC can decide if parts of the transaction exposure should be hedged. Transactions shall qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS and hedging beyond 18 months is not allowed.

Status at year-end The Group has continued to manage transaction exposures primarily by matching in- and outflows in the same currencies. Derivative instruments have only been used to hedge operational flows and have primarily been used to hedge transactions in AUD, EUR, GBP and USD.
The net nominal amounts in the main currencies are shown in the table below. During 2014 Edwards was acquired by Atlas Copco. Edwards hedges future cash flows to a larger extent than the rest of the Atlas Copco Group which explains the increase in hedging volume in 2014.

The largest operational surplus and deficit currencies are shown in Graph 1. The amounts presented in Graph 1 represent the estimate of the net amounts the Group has to exchange in different currencies. The estimates are based on the Group's intercompany payments and on payment flows from customers and to suppliers in the most significant currencies. The operational transaction exposure in MSEK is 10 401 (11 162) and is calculated as the net operational exposed cash flows.

Translation exposure Group currency risk policy Translation exposure risk is the risk that the value of the Group's net investments in foreign currencies is negatively affected by changes in exchange rates. The Group's worldwide presence creates a currency effect since the financial statements of entities with functional currencies other than SEK are translated to SEK when preparing the consolidated financial statements. The exposure is the net of assets and liabilities denominated in the specific currency. The effect of currency rate fluctuation on these net positions is the translation effect.
The following describes the Group's general policies for managing translation exposure: · Translation exposure should be reduced by matching assets and
liabilities in the same currencies. · The FRMC may decide to hedge part or all of the remaining
translation exposure. Any hedge of translation exposure shall qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS.

Status at year-end The Group uses loans and derivatives to reduce the translation exposure on net investments in USD and EUR in the consolidated financial statements and to reduce the exchange rate risk related to net assets in subsidiaries. These instruments are designated as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial instruments shown in the table below are used to hedge EUR- and USD-denominated net assets.

The Group's loan portfolio is also exposed to movement in currency rates. The impact on the net income would however be very limited as substantially all of the Group's loans are designated as hedges of net investments and the effect is accounted for in other comprehensive income (see also note 1, Accounting principles, Financial assets and liabilities).
Graph 3 indicates the Group's sensitivity to currency translation effects when earnings of foreign subsidiaries are translated. The graph indicates for example that the translation effect on the Group's pretax earnings would be ­135 (­135) if SEK strengthen by 1%.

Operational credit risk Group credit risk policy Operational credit risk is the risk that the Group's customers will not meet their payment obligations. The Group's operational credit risk policy is that business areas, divisions and individual business units are responsible for the commercial risks arising from their operations. The operational credit risk is measured as the net aggregate value of receivables on a customer.

Status at year-end Since the Group's sales are dispersed among many customers, of which no single customer represents a significant share of the Group's commercial risk, the monitoring of commercial credit risks is primarily done at the business area, divisional or business unit level. Each business unit is required to have an approved commercial risk policy.
The Group has an in-house customer finance operation (Atlas Copco Customer Finance) as a means of supporting equipment sales. At December 31, the credit portfolio of the customer finance operations totaled approximately 2 809 (2 707) consisting of 92 (100) reported as trade receivables, 836 (822) reported as finance lease receivables, and 1 881 (1 785) reported as other financial receivables. In addition, Atlas Copco Customer Finance also has noncancelable operating lease contracts of 751 (641). There were no significant concentrations of customer risks in these operations. No customer represented more than 5% of the total outstanding receivables. For further information, see note 22.

Atlas Copco Customer Finance maintains collateral for its credit portfolio primarily through repossession rights in equipment. Business units may also, partly, transfer the commercial risk insurance to external entities (normally to an export credit agency).

Provision for impairment of credit risks The business units establish provisions for impairment that represent their estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The main components of this provision are specific loss provisions corresponding to individually significant exposures and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have not yet been identified. The collective loss provision is determined based on historical data of default statistics for similar financial assets. At year-end 2014, the provision for bad debt amounted to 4.5% (4.4) of gross total customer receivables. The following table presents the gross value of trade receivables by ageing category together with the related impairment provisions.

The total estimated fair value of collateral for trade receivables amounted to 598 (617). Approximately 60% of collateral consisted of repossession rights and 40% of export credit insurance. Based on historical default statistics and the diversified customer base, the credit risk is assessed to be limited.
The gross amount of finance lease receivables amounted to 919 (822), of which 20 (22) have been impaired, and the gross amount of other financial receivables amounted to 2 489 (2 247), of which 52 (51) have been impaired. There are no significant amounts past due that are not impaired. The total estimated fair value of collateral to finance lease receivables and other finance receivables was 640 (575) and 1 900 (1 620), respectively, consisting primarily of repossession rights.
Financial credit risk Group credit risk policy Credit risk on financial transactions is the risk that the Group incurs losses as a result of non-payment by counterparts related to the Group's investments, bank deposits or derivative transactions. The financial credit risk is measured differently depending on the transaction type.
Investment transactions Efficient cash management systems should be maintained in order to minimize excess cash in operations where it cannot be invested or used to reduce interestbearing debt. Cash may only be invested if at least one of the credit ratings (as rated by Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings or Moody's) of the approved counterpart or underlying investment is at least A-/A3 in case of financial counterparties and funds and BBB-/Baa3 in case of non-financial counterparties. Investments in structured financial products are not allowed even if they meet the rating criteria, unless approved by the FRMC. Other criteria which are considered when investing include limiting the exposure with any single counterparty, the tenor, and liquidity of the investment. A list of approved counterparts with a maximum exposure limit for each counterpart is maintained and monitored.

Derivative transactions As part of the Group's management of financial risks, the Group enters into derivative transactions with financial counterparts. Such transactions may only be undertaken with approved counterparts for which credit limits have been established and with which ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreements and CSA (Credit Support Annex) agreements are in force. Derivative transactions may only be entered into by Group Treasury or in rare cases by another entity, but only after the approval of Group Treasurer. Atlas Copco primarily uses derivatives as hedging instruments and the policy allows only standardized (as opposed to structured) derivatives.
Status at year-end At year-end 2014, the measured credit risk on derivatives, taking into account the market-to-market value and collaterals amounted to 182 (254).

No financial assets or liabilities are offset in the balance sheet. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements and the fair values of derivatives that are not offset in the balance sheet are 326 (439) for assets and 655 (267) for liabilities. The table below shows derivatives covered by master netting agreements.

Other market and price risks Commodity-price risk is the risk that the cost of direct and indirect materials could increase as underlying commodity prices rise in global markets. The Group is directly and indirectly exposed to raw material price fluctuations. Cost increases for raw materials and components often coincide with strong end-customer demand and are offset by increased sales to mining customers and compensated for by increased market prices. Therefore, the Group does not hedge commodity-price risks.
Fair value of financial instruments In Atlas Copco's balance sheet, financial instruments are carried at fair value or at amortized cost. The fair value is established according to a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels. These levels should reflect the extent to which fair value is based on observable market data or own assumptions. Below is a description of each level in the fair value hierarchy and also valuation methods used for each financial instrument.
Level 1 Level 1 comprises financial instruments for which fair value is based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. A market is considered as active if quoted prices from an exchange, broker, industry group, pricing service, or supervisory body are readily and regularly available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions at arm's length.
Level 2 Level 2 comprises financial instruments for which fair value is based on models that utilize observable data for the asset or liability other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Example of observable data is data that can serve as a basis for assessing prices, such as market interest rates and yield curves.
Level 3 Level 3 comprises financial instruments for which fair value is based on a valuation model, whereby significant input is based on unobservable market data.

Valuation methods Derivatives Fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated based on prev ailing markets. Interest rate swaps are valued based on market rates and present value of future cash flows.
Interest-bearing liabilities Fair values are calculated based on market rates and present value of future cash flows.
Finance leases and other financial receivables Fair values are calculated based on market rates for similar contracts and present value of future cash flows.
The Group's financial instruments by category The carrying value for the Group's financial instruments corresponds to fair value in all categories except for borrowings and held-to-maturity investments. See note 21 for additional information about the Group's borrowings.

On February 9, Atlas Copco announced the decision to discontinue its Powercrusher business in which it manufactures and sells mobile crushers and screeners for quarrying, civil engineering and recycling. The Powercrusher business is part of the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area. It has about 70 employees and had revenues in 2014 of about MSEK 255 (MEUR 28).
Also on February 9, Atlas Copco sold its JC Carter business, which produces cryogenic submerged motor pumps, to Nikkiso Cryo Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Atlas Copco JC Carter had around 35 employees and the business was part of Atlas Copco's Gas and Process division within the Compressor Technique business area.
On March 3, Atlas Copco acquired Kalibriercentrum Bayern, which is headquartered near Munich with an additional laboratory in Kiel, Germany. The company provides laboratory and field calibration and related services to customers in, for example, the motor vehicle and aerospace industry.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PARENT COMPANY
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MSEK unless otherwise stated

A1. Significant accounting principles

Atlas Copco AB is the ultimate Parent Company of the Atlas Copco Group and is headquartered in Nacka, Sweden. Its' operations include administrative functions, holding company functions as well as part of Group Treasury.
The financial statements of Atlas Copco AB have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the recommendation RFR 2, "Accounting for Legal Entities", hereafter referred to as "RFR 2", issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. In accordance with RFR 2, parent companies that issue consolidated financial statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union, shall present their financial statements in accordance with IFRS, to the extent these accounting principles comply with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and may use exemptions from IFRS provided by RFR 2 due to Swedish accounting or tax legislation.
The financial statements are presented in Swedish kronor (SEK), rounded to the nearest million. The parent company's accounting principles have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated. The financial statements are prepared using the same accounting principles as described in note 1 to the Group's consolidated financial statements, except for those disclosed in the following sections.
For discussion regarding accounting estimates and judgments, see page 76.

Financial guarantees Financial guarantees issued by the Parent Company for the benefit of subsidiaries are not valued at fair value. They are reported as contingent liabilities, unless it becomes probable that the guarantees will lead to payments. In such case, provisions will be recorded.
Hedge accounting External interest-bearing liabilities denominated in other currencies than SEK, used to hedge currency exposure from investments in shares of foreign subsidiaries are not translated using the foreign exchange rates on the balance sheet date, but measured based on the exchange rate the day that the hedging relation was established.
Derivatives used to hedge investments in shares in foreign subsidiaries are recognized at fair value and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. The corresponding fair value change on shares in subsidiaries is recognized in profit or loss.
Group and shareholders' contributions In Sweden, Group contributions are deductible for tax purposes but shareholders' contributions are not. Group contributions are recognized as appropriations in the income statement. Shareholders' contributions are recognized as an increase of Shares in Group companies and tested for impairment.

Subsidiaries Participations in subsidiaries are accounted for by the Parent Company at historical cost. The carrying amounts of participations in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. See the Group's accounting policies, Impairment of financial assets, for further details.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business combination are accounted for by the Parent Company as part of the acquisition costs and are not expensed.

Lease contracts All lease contracts entered into by the Parent Company are accounted for as operating leases.

Employee benefits Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are not accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. In the Parent Company defined benefit plans are accounted for according to the Swedish law regarding pensions, "Tryggandelagen" and regulations issued by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Board. The primary differences as compared to IAS 19 are the way discount rates are fixed, that the calculation of defined benefit obligations is based on current salary levels, without consideration of future salary increases and that all actuarial gains and losses are included in profit or loss as they occur.

Share-based payments The share-based payments that the Parent Company has granted to employees in the Parent Company are accounted for using the same principle as described in note 1 in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
The share-based payments that the Parent Company has granted to employees in subsidiaries are not accounted for as an employee expense in the Parent Company, but are recognized against Shares in Group companies. This vesting cost is accrued over the same period as in the Group and with a corresponding increase in equity for equity-settled programs and as a change in liabilities for cash-settled programs.

Parent Company borrowings Atlas Copco AB had MSEK 20 619 (24 895) of external borrowings and MSEK 37 069 (40 084) of internal borrowings at December 31, 2014. Derivative instruments are used to manage the currency and interest rate risk in line with policies set by the Financial Risk Management Committee, see note 27 in the consolidated financial statements.
Hedge accounting The Parent Company hedges shares in subsidiaries through external loans of MEUR 1 452 (1 428) and MUSD 142 (142), and derivatives of MEUR 330 (582). The deferral hedge accounting of the external loans is based on a RFR 2 exemption. The derivatives are accounted as fair value hedges.
The interest rate risk is managed with interest rate swaps, designated as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Note 27 of the consolidated financial statements include fair value of these swaps and further details.
Financial credit risk Credit risk on financial transactions is the risk that the Parent Company incurs losses as a result of non-payment by counterparts related to the Parent Company's investments, bank deposits or derivative transactions. For further information regarding investment and derivative transactions, see note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.

For more information about fair value hierarchy, see note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation methods Derivatives Fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated based on prev ailing markets. Interest rate swaps are valued based on market rates and present value of future cash flows.

The Parent Company's financial instruments by category The carrying value for the Parent Company's financial instruments corresponds to fair value in all categories except for borrowings.

AUDIT REPORT

To the annual meeting of the shareholders of Atlas Copco AB Corporate identity number 556014-2720

Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Atlas Copco AB for the financial year 2014, except for the corporate governance report on pages 56-65. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included in the printed version of this document on pages 14­47 and 56­122.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President for the annual accounts and consolidated accounts The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual accounts in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and of the consolidated accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and the President determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts and consolidated accounts based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors and the President, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
Opinions In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2014 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2014 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and

the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance report on pages 56­65. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and the administration of the Board of Directors and the President of Atlas Copco AB for the financial year 2014. We have also conducted a statutory examination of the corporate governance report.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and the Board of Directors and the President are responsible for administration under the Companies Act and that the corporate governance report has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.
Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, we examined the Board of Directors' reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to determine whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President has, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Furthermore, we have read the corporate governance report and based on that reading and our knowledge of the company and the group we believe that we have a sufficient basis for our opinions. This means that our statutory examination of the corporate governance report is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
Opinions We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year.
A corporate governance report has been prepared, and its statutory content is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.

SUSTAINABILITY NOTES
NOTES TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) PERFORMANCE

1. Reporting principles of the environmental, social and governance performance

Since 2001, the report has been prepared yearly in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. Since 2006 the report has followed the GRI 3.0 version guidelines. The most recent sustainability report was published in March 2014 as part of the annual report 2013.
This report is also Atlas Copco's Communication on Progress (COP), a report on performance in relation to the UN Global Compact's ten principles. It can be found at www.atlascopco.com/ir and on UN Global Compact's website at unglobalcompact.org/cop.
Atlas Copco adheres to the following internationally recognized voluntary standards and principles: · UN Global Compact. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, a strate-
gic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. · Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The guidelines (G3) include an internationally recognized set of indicators for economic, environmental and social aspects of business performance that enables stakeholders to compare companies' performance. Atlas Copco's reporting according to the reporting principles and guidance, including required disclosures, can be found at www.atlascopco.com/ir.
Data collection and reporting The sustainability report and the corporate governance report are integrated in the 2014 annual report. Sustainability information in the annual report is primarily presented on pages 10­13, 40­53 and 125­131, and in the GRI Compliance Index. Reported facts and figures have been verified in accordance with Atlas Copco's procedures for internal control. Data collection is integrated into the Group reporting consolidation systems and collected on a quarterly basis. Reported values are normally not corrected retroactively, but when a restatement of historically reported numbers is done this can be due to a change of calculation method or scope. Environmental data covers production units and distribution centers. Business partner data covers production units and employee data covers all operations. Responsibility for reporting rests with the General Manager of each company. Data is reported at local operating unit level, aggregated to division/business area and Group level. Data verification is performed at each level before submitting to external auditors for verification.
The reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is done in accordance with the GHG Protocol (ghgprotocol.org) and the International Energy Agency (iea.org). The Group is a member of the Swedish Network for Transport and Environment (NTM) and closely follows its recommendations, which may impact the reporting guideline of CO2 emissions from transport.
Scope The Annual Report includes information regarding all three aspects of the Group's strategy i.e. where Atlas Copco has a significant economic, environmental and social impact. The report covers Atlas Copco's operations for the fiscal year 2014, unless otherwise stated. Operations divested during the year

are excluded; units that were acquired are included. This may at times cause major changes in reported performance. Limitations and reporting principles are explained in the relevant section of the report. For the reporting period of 2014 all publicly disclosed sustainability information can be found in the publication Atlas Copco's annual report 2014, except for the GRI Compliance Index, which is available on the Atlas Copco website, www.atlascopco.com/ir.
Atlas Copco's annual report 2014 includes a general overview of the Group's environmental situation in accordance with the requirements of Swedish legislation regarding environmental information in the Board of Director's Report. In addition, environmental and social information has been integrated into the annual report where appropriate in order to provide a more complete picture of the Group. In addition, Atlas Copco reports with reference to the content elements and guiding principles of the Inaugural Integrated Reporting Framework developed by the International Integrated Reporting Council.
The reason for integrating the sustainability information in the annual report is to provide investors and stakeholders with a relatively complete and easily accessible overview of the Atlas Copco Group's most important activities contributing to sustainable development and increasing shareholder value.
Materiality The GRI core indicators reported and analyzed are those that are understood to be material to the Atlas Copco Group and its stakeholders, and which facilitate benchmarking with other companies in a broader sense. Key issues are identified through ongoing stakeholder engagement and are addressed by programs or action plans with clear measurable targets.
Stakeholder dialogue As a global Group, it's vital for Atlas Copco to ensure accountability for its actual and potential impact on its stakeholders. In discussions with for example NGO's, GO's and other influencers, it takes advice and/or learns from listening to their views. In 2014, one formal stakeholder dialogue was conducted with major shareholders, with the participation of members of Group management. The focus of the meeting was to review Atlas Copco's sustainability performance and discuss its approach to business in complex markets. The presentation is available at www.atlascopco.com/us/sustainability. Other stakeholder dialogues are conducted at different levels in the Group. Major issues are collected and form the basis for development of strategic responses to challenges.
Review/audit Atlas Copco has self-declared the report to be GRI B+ level compliant. The report covers all Profile Disclosures, all Disclosures on Management Approach and at least 20 Performance Indicators. The annual report has been reviewed and approved by Atlas Copco's Group Management and the Atlas Copco Board. The sustainability information in the annual report 2014 has been subject to limited assurance by Deloitte.

Reporting principles of the environmental, social and 1. governance performance, continued
Additional ESG Disclosure In addition to producing an integrated report, Atlas Copco discloses its environmental, social and governance performance to investors through questionnaires and interviews with analysts. This disclosure is in line with the contents published in the annual report. Atlas Copco applies for inclusion in a select few, reputable and internationally established sustainability indices such as the FTSE4Good and the RobecoSAM Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
The CDP is an international non-profit organization that provides selfreported climate change, water and forest risk data to investors representing USD 87 trillion in assets. In 2013, the CDP began its collaboration with the Dow Jones Sustainability Index to streamline the environmental disclosure component. The scoring is out of a maximum of 100 with `A' being the highest grade for disclosure, the top scoring companies are included in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI).
In addition to this, the CDP allows participating companies to request emissions data from select suppliers. In 2014, the CDP Supply Chain questionnaire was sent by the CDP on behalf of 64 companies.

Atlas Copco has never paid for inclusion in rankings or lists, irrespective of the size of the fee requested, and has no ambition to change its position in the future. For this reason, Atlas Copco has not submitted an application for inclusion in the Ethisphere WME for 2014.

2. Materiality

Atlas Copco takes inspiration from the GRI criteria for materiality to ensure that the annual report addresses all the sustainability issues that impact or are influenced by the Group's operations. The materiality analysis identifies relevant indicators that present significant risks or opportunities to the Group, and whether their impact can be reasonably estimated through reliable and sound investigative methods. Indicators, which do not qualify on all accounts, are regarded as immaterial and not reported. The remaining material indicators are prioritized based on their relevance to internal and external stakeholders. The issues that have the greatest relevance to both stakeholder groups and deemed business critical are included in the annual report. Other material issues with less priority are published on the Atlas Copco website, www.atlascopco.com/corporateresponsibility.

The result from stakeholder dialogues is illustrated in the materiality matrix below and reflected in this report.

3. Environmental impact1)

Performance towards goals Overall, Atlas Copco is on track with its target to reduce CO2 from operations and transport by 20% by 2020 with respect to cost of goods sold. The aquisitions contributed to an increase. Weather fluctuations, such as warmer winters which required less heating, and fluctuations in business partly resulted in decreased emissions. The goal to keep water consumption at 2010 levels with respect to cost of goods sold was also on track for 2014. A portion of the reduction is attributed to corrections in reporting, however the Group took efforts to proactively address leaks and implement water-efficiency measures which showed results in 2014.
A significant part of the Group's environmental impact from operations comes from the materials and energy consumed as part of the production and the waste resulting from these operations.
The waste increased both in total volumes and in relation to cost of sales. This was largely influenced by a recent acquisition and of more metal scrap waste. A decline in the business also affected the cost of goods sold. All of the metal scrap is being recycled.

Atlas Copco follows applicable environmental laws in all countries where the Group operates. Incidents or fines are reported for non-compliance with environmental legislation, as well as incidents involving chemical, oil or fuel spillages. In 2014, there were no major incidents reported concerning these aspects.
Five Swedish companies require permits based on Swedish environmental regulations. These operations account for approximately 20% of the Group's manufacturing and mostly involve machining and assembly of components. The permits relate to areas such as emissions to water and air, as well as noise pollution. The Group has been granted all permits needed to conduct its business and none were under revision in 2014. There were 11 accidents resulting in adverse environmental effects and one case of injury/illness resulting from environmental accidents according to reporting. All accidents were addressed fully and comprehensively and clean-up costs amounted to KSEK 4 752. There were no cases of non-compliance and hence no fines were paid in 2014.
Environmental management systems To help minimize the environmental impact and to secure that the precautionary approach is applied, Atlas Copco has a target to implement environmental management systems (EMS) in all operations. All product companies should be certified according to ISO 14001 in order to manage and reduce their environmental impact. Acquired product companies are normally certified within a two-year period.
Product responsibility As a minimum, all products comply with laws and regulations regarding their environmental impact and they are tested for safety prior to delivery. Further, all Atlas Copco products and services come with relevant product, service and safety information. The product and service information required by the Group's procedures for product and service information and labeling covers aspects such as sourcing of components, content such as substances of concern, safe use and disposal of the product. Customer training is included when relevant, to secure safe handling of the products.
In general, a limited proportion of Atlas Copco products fall under the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. For example, handheld electric tools and monitoring control instruments qualify but not large mining and other capital equipment. Atlas Copco has a responsibility for the disposal of products that fall under the directive. Atlas Copco strives to follow laws and regulations regarding safety, health and environmental aspects, product information and labeling. No new cases have been filed in 2014 for non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning the provision and use of products and services.
Sustainable construction Atlas Copco has a goal to construct its buildings according to a sustainable building standard, such as LEED. This regards both new and reconstructed buildings over 2 000 m2. The expected results of the sustainable buildings are reduced environmental impact, reduced maintenance cost and improved working environment for the employees.

Environmental data visualizations Atlas Copco annual report 2014 utilizes data visualization to facilitate the understanding of complex environmental data. Volumetric assumptions for CO2, from transport as illustrated on page 53, are based on the density of CO2 at standard pressure and 15°C: 1.87 kg/m3. At this temperature and pressure, the gas would occupy a volume of 110.22 million m3, which would fill a cube with a side length of 479.4 m. The relative heights of the Empire State building (443 m), Eiffel tower (324 m) and Statue of Liberty (93 m) are visualized for additional context. The image was designed using a visualization tool developed for Atlas Copco by Carbon Visuals.
The conversion of operational energy consumption to household equivalents as illustrated on page 52 is based on the average electricity consumption per electrified household in 2011 (source: Enerdata via World Energy Council). Assumptions for product related visualization are explained in ESG note 10.

4. Safety and health
Safety is a priority area for Atlas Copco, and in 2014 the number of accidents decreased to 389 (415). The largest decrease was from the number of accidents reported from operations in Africa and the Middle East. Operations in North America also reported a small decrease. The majority of the accidents reported were in Europe, but the number did not change significantly from the previous year. An increase in the number of accidents, however, came from operations in Asia/Australia and South America. The relative number of accidents decreased to 4.7 (5.4) per one million working hours.
The number of incidents increased to 1 713 (1 620). The relative number, however, remained stable at 20.8 (21.0) incidents per one million working hours. Operations in Europe and South America showed an increase in the number of incidents, while all other regions reported a slight decrease.

Supply chain management process: Suppliers are evaluated during and after selection by product companies, primarily by personnel in the purchasing function. Internal training on how to carry out supplier evaluations is published in the Group database The Way We Do Things.

The supplier evaluation process examines: · Business partners' record of governance, ethics and stance
against corruption · Labor issues: Rejection of forced, compulsory or child labor,
elimination of discrimination, safeguarding employee health and safety, collective bargaining rights · Environmental performance: Managing waste, minimizing emissions, and reducing consumption of natural resources · Human rights issues: Responsible sourcing and respect for human rights in operations

At times self-assessment checklists are sent to suppliers and on-site evaluations are conducted either at regular intervals or when deemed necessary. These result in a report with concrete suggestions in the form of an action plan or improvement to be followed up on at an agreed time. Atlas Copco can provide experience and know-how to suppliers who require support in order to comply with the minimum standards set forth in the 10-criteria checklist; however suppliers who fail to meet red-flag criteria (such as zero-tolerance of corruption) or do not show a willingness to improve are rejected. Supplier evaluations regarding safety, health, social and environment aspects including objective factors such as quality and financial data are performed throughout the Group.
Definition of significant supplier for reporting: All external suppliers of goods and services, direct and indirect, with a purchasing value above a set threshold, based on 12 month values from October prior year to September current year. For suppliers in high-risk countries listed below, suppliers are determined to be significant based on a significantly lower purchasing threshold (approximately 13% of set value) and are reported.
High-risk countries: Angola, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia,

Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe. These countries are identified as having a heightened risk of human rights violations or corruption based on risk mapping provided by Amnesty International and Transparency International in 2011. The adaptation of the definition had resulted in a lower number of significant suppliers as from 2013 compared to previous years. In 2014, the number of significant suppliers increased, primarily due to acquisitions.

1) Evaluations or audits are conducted by Atlas Copco teams directly at the suppliers' sites. 2) Reasons for rejection include for example safety in the workplace, personal protection for
workers and no fulfillment of environmental laws. Suppliers are rejected if they do not meet Atlas Copco requirements and are not willing to improve. The Group does not keep any black lists of its business partners.

Prohibited or restricted substances Atlas Copco maintains lists of substances which are either prohibited or restricted due to their potential negative impact on health or the environment. Prohibited substances are not allowed in the Group's products or processes. Restricted substances are not yet legally excluded for use but should be replaced according to a plan that takes into account technical and financial aspects. Suppliers' use of such substances is regularly checked, and if prohibited substances should be found, they must immediately be replaced with approved alternatives. The lists are continuously revised according to applicable legislation, including REACH. The lists on prohibited and restricted substances are published on the Atlas Copco website.

6. Governance

Atlas Copco's hotline is the Group's whistleblower function of the Business Code of Practice. The Group is positive to receiving reports through the hotline since it provides the possibility to act on potential misconduct to the Business Code of Practice. During the year the hotline has been promoted globally among employees and business partners.

Six cases are still under investigation, of which three are related to fraud, one to corruption, and two to labor relations or other concerns. Cases of fraud and corruption were substantiated in five cases and led to disciplinary actions such as dismissal or changes in procedures to prevent future occurrences. The alleged cases of discrimination were not substantiated and closed after investigation. There have been no other instances of anti-competitive behavior brought to the attention of Group Management. No fines related to the hotline have been paid during the year.

7. Public policy
In 2014, Atlas Copco appointed a Vice President EU Governmental and Regulatory Affairs in order to directly engage with stakeholders on matters of public policy from the Group level. Atlas Copco belongs to trade organizations such as The Association of Swedish Engineering Industries, the Federation for the Technology Industry in Belgium, the Compressed Air and Gas Institute in the United States, the German Engineering Federation, and many others. Since 1959, Atlas Copco has been actively involved in Pneurop, the European committee of manufacturers of compressors, vacuum pumps, pneumatic tools and allied equipment. Pneurop acts on behalf of members in European and international forums regarding the harmonization of technical, normative and legislative development.
Atlas Copco is a member of the Committee for the European Construction Equipment Industry (CECE) which works, for example, in removing technical barriers and improving safety standards and environmental aspects of construction equipment. In addition, the company participates in ongoing development of international standards, including the ISO committee ISO/TC 118 and the CEN committee CEN 232.
The Atlas Copco Group does not take political stands and does not use Group funds or assets to support political campaigns or candidates, or otherwise provides services to political endeavors. Atlas Copco does not receive any significant assistance from governments.
8. Human rights
Commitment to human rights Atlas Copco's central guiding policy is the Business Code of Practice which was updated in 2012 to support the United Nations International Bill of Human Rights. Atlas Copco is also a signatory of the UN Global Compact and is committed to working with the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. The Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice also supports the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as well as the OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In 2011, Atlas Copco took on the commitment to protect, respect and provide access to remedy with regards to human rights as proposed in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In accordance with requirements of the framework, Atlas Copco has:
· Policy commitment: The Business Code of Practice is the central policy document, based on which Atlas Copco has a public human rights statement. This can be found on the website.
· Human rights due diligence: An ongoing process to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for the human rights impacts related to Atlas Copco's business or business relations.
· Access to remedy: The Atlas Copco hotline can be used to report perceived human rights violations and in cases where the stakeholder(s) or employee(s) are not satisfied with the solution provided by the ethical hotline, Atlas Copco will provide for mediation at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Institute.

8. Human rights, continued
Integrating the rights of children, women and special vulnerable groups Atlas Copco strives to be inclusive in its human rights work to ensure that the rights of vulnerable groups such as children or minorities are covered by policies and processes. The Group works to integrate this into the broader human rights approach, and assesses the direct and indirect impacts the business can have on relevant groups.
Atlas Copco's Human Rights approach Working with human rights is a continuous process of learning, development and implementation. Atlas Copco strives to work with issues within its scope across the value chain. Atlas Copco does not view human rights as an isolated issue, but rather a cross-connected issue which can be impacted by working with corruption and environmental issues according to the Business Code of Practice. The Group strives to work with its commitment to the UN Guiding Principles across the value chain, covering procurement, human resources, sales, marketing and other business processes. Further details can be found in the Society, Business Partner and Employee sections of the report.
In the end of 2013, Atlas Copco set up an interdisciplinary Human Rights and Ethics Steering Committee which reports to the Compliance Board. The members of the committee also overlap partially with the Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Council. The Compliance Board contains two members of Group Management. The steering committee began work in 2014 to address issues such as training needs, impact assessment and the action points related to the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles.
Review of action points from previous year In the previous annual report, Atlas Copco set forth several action points that were addressed throughout 2014. Group Management approved the guidelines focused on conflict-affected regions, and this was spread to the organization via the Group's central information database, The Way We Do Things. The Group has taken measures to ensure that no future sales go to projects which may make it complicit in the violation of international law, with a special attention to occupied or non-self governing territories.
Atlas Copco explored public-private partnerships on a local and Group level, in order to support the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles and to increase leverage to respect human rights. In 2014, Atlas Copco joined the Swedish Leadership for Sustainable Development, a business network run by the Swedish International Development Cooperation, to strengthen its approach on environment, human rights and anti-corruption. The Group also participated in cross-industry dialogues in order to share best practices and tools from the implementation process, as well as learning points from the roll out of the Group's Business & Human Rights approach.
Atlas Copco continues to be in dialogue with the EIRIS Conflict Risk Network, with regards to indirect sales to Sudan and is classified as "Substantial Action". This means investors following the targeted Sudan legislative model do not need to take divestment measures. The Group will continue its humanitarian efforts is Sudan through Water for All projects.
Conflict minerals Atlas Copco is a supplier to customers required to report on the Dodd Frank Act, section 1502 in the United States. In 2014, all business areas continued working with the standard template developed in joint collaboration by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) to map the minerals and sourcing processes used by tier 1 suppliers. In order to safeguard the quality of the supplier engagement and the due diligence, Atlas Copco did not add additional supplier tiers into the scope of the investigation in 2014.

Atlas Copco believes in good corporate practice in the area of tax management, balancing the interests of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and the governments and communities in the countries in which the Group operates. See note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for the details of taxes paid, reported according to the international financial reporting standards.
Opinion on disclosing tax by country Atlas Copco has been in dialogue with investors, NGOs and peers regarding the disclosure of tax paid per country. At present there is no international standard for reporting taxes paid by country and therefore the resulting data is not comparable between different companies. Atlas Copco is not opposed to reporting tax paid by country if guidelines are broadened to apply to all companies in the industry so that the data is comparable and can be analyzed fairly.
Presence in countries classified as tax havens Atlas Copco has companies in over 90 countries. Sometimes these companies are in countries that can be classified as tax havens, such as Panama. However, the reason for Atlas Copco's presence in these markets is that the Group has customers with ongoing projects, such as expanding the Panama Canal.

10. Customer energy efficiency
Increasing sales by delivering energy efficient products Atlas Copco has a Group goal to increase customer energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. Each division under each business area develops product lines to meet this ambition in order to increase sales while reducing the environmental impact.

Surface drill rigs, which consist of the total range of hydraulic surface drill rigs, showed an improvement of 17% in energy efficiency. Within this product line, which has been introduced by the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area, the top hammer surface drill rigs SmartROC T35 and SmartROC T40 showed an improvement of 48%. The surface drill rigs have been updated with Tier IV engines, which has improved the energy efficiency. The top hammer rigs has, additionally, been modified to direct energy to the pumps and motors only when these are being used. The energy efficiency calculation is based on estimated typical energy consumption for each product included in the product line. The estimates are based on performed field test results. The energy efficiency figures are collected through a system, which collects and transmits all data relevant to the equipment electronically for accurate and reliable analysis. The energy efficiency improvement is the average energy efficiency value of the products sold during 2010 and 2014.
The electrical nutrunners represent a significant part of the Industrial Technique business area portfolio. This product line includes electric tightening tools such as the EME 80-20J, which is used in the automotive manufacturing process. During 2014, the business area developed software that will allow multiple battery tools to be connected to a single controller, which decreased energy consumption and purchasing cost. For the environment this means lower CO2 emissions and lower raw material use. For the energy efficiency calculation a number of tools have been selected that represent the full range of torque tools. The energy consumption for each tool is based on a defined working scenario. The energy efficiency figure presented is the weighted average of the energy consumption and the amount of products sold during 2010 and 2014.
Data for the product line variable speed drive (VSD) compressors was also collected directly from the equipment while in use. The evolution of the energy efficiency includes the GA 26 VSD FF and the GA 15 VSD+ compressor.
The product line XAHS186 portable compressor provides significant energy savings and has lower emissions due to compliancy to Stage IIIB engine requirements. During the development phase, analyses of load cycle for typical applications allowed the Construction Technique business area to establish the best combination of design parameters, a new engine with catalyst and particle filter, and the efficiency of Atlas Copco's compressor elements. Together, this reduces the fuel consumption of the compressor from 18.4 to 14.8 kg/hour at 75% load, which is the normal load for the typical application.

Product energy efficiency visualizations The variable speed drive (VSD) case presented on pages 1, 4 and 42 are based on the total sales over the past 20 years for both VSD and VSD+ compressors, with an average size of 26 kW. The compressors were assumed to run for more than 3 000 hours per year, and the energy savings are in relation to compressors without variable speed drive. The energy savings calculations was then visualized using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies calculator (www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html ). The EPA calulator's comparisons to annual greenhouse gas emissions from cars and households were used to illustrate the case.

SUSTAINABILITY NOTES
AUDITOR'S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT ON ATLAS COPCO AB'S SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

This is the translation of the auditor's report in Swedish. To Atlas Copco AB

Introduction We have been engaged by the Board of Directors and the President of Atlas Copco AB to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the Atlas Copco AB's Sustainability Report for the year 2014. The Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability Report on page 126.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management for the Sustainability Report The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria, as explained on page 126 in the Sustainability Report, and are the parts of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (published by The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)) which are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This responsibility also includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of the auditor Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with

RevR 6 Assurance of Sustainability Reports issued by FAR. A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement conducted in accordance with IAASB's Standards on Auditing and Quality Control and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures performed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion.
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.
Conclusion Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.
