FY 2011 Results (January - December) The results are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved by the European Union. ACCIONA reports in accordance with its corporate structure, which comprises six divisions:
Energy: includes development, construction, operation and maintenance of renewable energy installations and related manufacturing activities. Infrastructures: includes construction, engineering and transport and hospital concessions activities. Real Estate: includes property rental, property development and parkings (The latter were sold in July. Therefore, in 2011 they will only contribute to the group's results during the first half of the year). Logistic & Transport Services: end-to-end passenger and cargo transport by land, sea and air. Water & Environment: water, urban services and environment protection services. Other Business and Financial: fund manager and securities brokering business, wine production and other businesses.

FY 2011 Results (January - December)

EBITDA in FY 2011 increased 8.3% vs. FY 2010, mainly due to the positive performance of the Energy division driven by:
A higher pool price in Spain during 2011 vs. 2010. A higher international wind load factor. The contribution in 2011 of the 701MW installed during the last twelve months (625MW net mainly due to the 68MW reduction of cogeneration capacity).
The group's EBITDA margin slightly improved reaching 19.7%, mainly due to the increased weight and higher margin of the Energy division.
Regarding the EBITDA breakdown by division, the main contributor was Energy (72.6%), followed by Infrastructures (16.3%) and Water & Environment (4.1%). The rest of the divisions contributed 6.9%.

Gross capital expenditure during the period amounted to 989 million, including 802 million invested in the organic growth of ACCIONA Energy and 275 million corresponding to the Infrastructures division (concessions mainly). As a result of the sale of the Splau! shopping mall last October, the Real Estate division has registered a net divestment of 182 million. The total capital expenditure in the remaining business areas during 2011 amounted to 94 million.

The group's balance sheet as of December 2011 shows an increase in the financial gearing ratio vs. December 2010, reaching 124%. The slight increase of the Net Financial Debt as of December 2011 (6,991 million) vs. December 2010 (6,587 million) was due to FY 2011 capex (989 million), which was partially funded with the cash flow generated during the period and the divestments carried out.

FY 2011 Results (January - December)
Revenues
Consolidated revenues increased by 6.1% to 6,646 million, mainly due to:
The growth within the Infrastructures division (+12.9%), mainly due to the growth of the international construction business. The positive performance of ACCIONA Energy (+10.2%), due to an improvement of the pool price in Spain (+36.3%), a higher international wind load factor and the contribution during 2011 of the 701MW installed during the last twelve months. The revenue reduction of the Real Estate division by 48.9% mainly due to lower sales in the promotion activity. Furthermore, the parking business has only contributed to the division's results during the first half of the year 2011, whereas in 2010 it contributed during the whole year. The fall of revenues from Logistic & Transport division (-8.1%) due to the lower activity of Trasmediterránea during 2011.
EBITDA
FY2011 EBITDA amounted to 1,312 million, meaning an increase of 8.3% mainly due to the good performance of the Energy division (+16.4%), which was responsible for a 72.6% of the Group's EBITDA; and to a lesser extent to the EBITDA growth of the Infrastructures division (+5.6%) and other businesses (+19.6%) vs. 2010.
The EBITDA margin in 2011 increased 40 basic points from 19.3% in 2010 to 19.7% in 2011. Such margin improvement is mainly due to the weight increase of the Energy division which has seen its margin rising from 54.9% to 57.9%.
EBIT
EBIT increased by 20% to 632 million and EBIT margin increased to 9.5% in December 2011 vs. 8.4% in December 2010. EBIT was affected by:
Provisions for the impairment of Real Estate assets for an amount of 269 million. Capital gains generated from the disposal of two concessions in Chile "Americo Vespucio Sur" and "Red Litoral Central" as well as the disposal of the parking business for a total amount of 280 million.
EBT
EBT amounted to 224 million, a 6.8% less than in 2010.
Attributable Net Profit
The attributable net profit amounted to 202 million, 20.8% higher than in 2010.

* The generation figure published includes electric generation revenues from the different technologies and from services provided and others.

ACCIONA Energy revenues increased 10.2% reaching 1,650 million.

It is to be highlighted the good performance from the generation revenues which have increased by 16.8% due to the recovery of pool prices vs. FY 2010 average price (+36.3%). Such price improvement compensates the lower hydro and wind load factors in Spain vs. FY 2010. It is worth mentioning that these load factors were exceptionally high during 1H10.

EBITDA margin increased from 54.9% to 57.9%. Accordingly, ACCIONA Energy's EBITDA amounted to 956 million, a 16.4% higher than in 2010.

During 2011 ACCIONA Energy has installed a total capacity of 701MW: 50MW solar thermoelectric in Spain and 651MW wind (47MW in Spain, 306MW in Mexico, 132MW in USA, 56MW in India, 41MW in Canada, 32MW in Australia and 38MW in Poland).

Revenues increased by 12.9% to 3,522 million boosted by a higher activity in the international construction business. EBITDA increased by 5.6% to 215 million. The EBITDA margin slightly decreased from 6.5% to 6.1%. Despite of the sale of the two mature Chilean concessions during the second quarter of the year, the concession business remains at similar levels to 2010. EBT was 123 million, 26.5% higher than in 2010, with a margin of 3.5%.
As of 31st December 2011 the construction backlog amounted to 6,497 million which means a 10% decrease vs. 31st December 2010. The international backlog increases its overall weight to 41% from 38% twelve months ago.

ACCIONA Real Estate revenues amounted to 104 million, and EBITDA was reduced to 12 million. This is mainly due to the lower number of homes delivered in Spain as well as a lower contribution from the international residential development business.
Additionally, it is worth highlighting that the parking business was sold in 2Q11 and therefore it only contributed to the results of the division during 1H11.

Housing stock decreased by 216 units over the last twelve months, from 1,177 in December 2010 to 961 in December 2011.
The real estate market in Spain has been characterized by a significant decline in prices and a shortage of transactions. ACCIONA believes that this situation will further deteriorate in the near future, mainly driven by financial institutions placing real estate asset in the market at low prices. Consequently, and with a conservative approach, a stress test scenario has been run, which considers the effects that these distorting elements would have on development assets. As a result of this stress test ACCIONA has made a provision amounting to 269 million, which is related for the most part to land and finished products.

During FY 2011, ACCIONA Logistic & Transport Services revenues decreased by 8.1% to 714 million.
The lower volume of passengers and vehicles mainly in the South-Strait market, the declining cargo levels in the Canary Islands and a higher unitary cost of fuel affected Trasmediterránea's results, and caused a reduction in the EBITDA of the division.
The number of passengers and the cargo handled (lane metres) decreased by 14.5% and 7.5% respectively. The number of vehicles was of 621,193, a 13.9% lower than the same period last year.

Attributable Equity
ACCIONA's attributable equity as of 31st December 2011 amounted to 5,344 million, which means a decrease of 6.8% vs. December 2010 mostly due to the effect of the dividend distribution, the acquisition of treasury shares, the results of the exercise and the negative evolution of coverage derivatives on interest rates.

Net Financial Debt
The Net Financial Debt has increased from 6,587 million as of 31st December 2010 to 6,991 million as of 31st December 2011. This slight increase was due to FY 2011 gross capex (989 million), which was partially funded with the cash flow generated during the period and the divestments carried out.
