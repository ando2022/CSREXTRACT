Letter from the Chairman
Dear shareholders,
Once again I have the satisfaction of addressing you to provide you with a report on the results for the 2017 financial year and to list the most significant events which occurred within our Company during that time.
Acerinox ended last year with the best results in the last 10 years; it achieved profits totalling 234 million euros, three times higher than in 2016, and generated an EBITDA amounting to 489 million euros, 48.6% higher than in 2016. The sales margin was 10.6%, the highest figure in the last decade, while the turnover stood at 4,627 million euros, representing an increase of 16.6% over the previous year.
The EBITDA achieved, in terms of both its amount and the sales margin, exceeded the figures recorded in 2010 and 2014 (financial years regarded as satisfactory), despite the fact that the prices in the main markets were lower than they were during the above years, underscoring the efforts the company has made to improve its efficiency. The good performance of demand in the main global economies, the successful price management performed by Acerinox and the Company's operational strategy were decisive factors in achieving the excellent results during the year.
The good performance of demand in the main global economies, reflected in the growth of the stainless steel sector, the successful price management implemented by Acerinox in all its markets, despite it being a year marked by the high volatility of raw materials, and the Company's positive operational strategy, focused on optimising production capacities and constantly improving its efficiency, were all key factors in achieving the excellent results during the year, to which we must add the positive impact at the end of the year brought about by the tax reform approved in the United States.
We know that our sector is heavily dependent on the evolution of the global economy and, of course, of the regions in which we operate. In 2017 the world economy maintained the upward trend which began four years ago and the figures were higher than in 2015 and 2016, registering growth of 3.7% at year-end. Once again, the world production of stainless steel throughout the year surpassed the initial growth forecasts, standing, according to our estimates, at 5.7% for
2

the year as a whole, which means that the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) has remained at 5.9% since 1950 and 7.1% in the last decade.
All the regions in the world in which we have a significant presence reactivated their economies, recording strong and sustained growth. Thus, the United States economy grew by 2.3% (one point more than in the previous year), while the European GDP rose by 2.5%, with a healthy rise of 3.1% in Spain. As a whole, the countries which make up the ASEAN area grew by 5.3%, a figure one point higher than that recorded in 2016. Even the South African economy, affected by political instability, grew by 1.3%, an improvement on the figure for 2016. Finally, the Chinese economy, which, as we know all too well, significantly conditions the development of our sector, grew by 6.9%, in line with the two previous years.
The positive trend of the economies in which we operate was reflected in sustained increases in the real consumption of stainless steel. In the Americas, chiefly in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the market growth of flat products stood at around 3%, boosted by the satisfactory performance of the construction sector, household appliances and, to a lesser extent, the car industry. Long product production rose by 20%, chiefly due to the reactivation of the hydrocarbon sector, given that the price of oil reached a figure above US$60 per barrel. In Europe, real consumption of our products confirmed the trend in 2016 and the key sectors displayed very positive behaviour throughout 2017, leading to a 0.7% upturn in the apparent consumption of flat products, with a growth of 0.7% (as many as 5.37 million tonnes), thereby consolidating the sharp rise seen in 2016. Spain was among the European countries with the highest growth rates (4.6%), due, without doubt, to the significant vitality of our economy. With regard to Africa and the Middle East, the increases in consumption were particularly high in Morocco, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. The other side of the coin was South Africa, as its apparent consumption fell by 6.9%, reflecting the difficulties its economy has undergone in recent years. Finally, apparent consumption once again increased in China and the ASEAN area; in the case of China it rose by 7.2%, mainly due to its domestic consumption in this year 2017, as its exports appeared to stabilise. This is a very good sign in terms of the balance between internal capacity and demand in the country.
Once again, volatility was one of the variables with the greatest effect on our industry and the results for the year. Prices of raw materials improved during the year but were affected throughout this time by the above phenomenon, with an impact on market behaviour and, of course, the prices of our products. Notwithstanding the above, the successful use of our factories' capacity and productive mix, as well as the price management performed by the Company, resulted in a significant rise in turnover. Acerinox's production volumes rose in comparison with the previous
3

Letter from the Chairman
year, with upturns of 1.3% in cold rolling, 1% in hot rolling and 1.8% in steel mill production. It is worth noting that our Bahru Stainless plant, which operates in the most competitive market in the world, increased its production by 33.4%.
The good results displayed were also affected by volatility during the year; thus, the EBITDA for first quarter of the year recorded the exceptional figure of 191 million euros, with an extraordinary 15.3% sales margin, but fell in an abnormally weak third quarter, registering 53 million euros and a 5.0% sales margin. Fortunately, it recovered in the fourth quarter, with behaviour much more in keeping with the yearly average.
As I mentioned above, the highly satisfactory results for the year were achieved not only due to the aforementioned factors, but also to the constant efforts to improve efficiency deployed in recent years through the excellence plans implemented within our Company. However, in addition, a new circumstance arose this year, namely the tax reform approved in the United States at the end of the year, which has had a positive impact on our results. Its principal measure is the reduction in the federal tax rate, from the figure of 35% applicable until now to 21%. This reduction will have very positive effects on our Group in the future, since it reduces the tax burden of the company which generates the most profits and which, until now, paid the highest amount of corporate tax. It also had positive effects on this year, with the recognition of the effect of the reduction in the tax rate for deferred tax liabilities, without which the result after taxes and minority interests would have been 26 million euros lower, with the figure ending up at 208 million euros.
I would like to refer now to the variable many people regard as key when it comes to measuring the performance of any business and which, in our case, we consider to be an important priority for the Group: cash generation during the year. As a result of the control of the working capital, we were able to generate an operating cash flow of 366 million euros. This enabled us to make payments on investments during the year amounting to 185 million euros. The free cash flow generated was 181 million euros, enabling us to pay the dividend in cash in the amount of 124 million euros.
The financial debt fell by 11 million euros in comparison with the previous year, standing at 609 million euros. This reduction would have been more significant had it not been for the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on our treasury positions in the United States.
It is also worth highlighting the efficient financial management performed by our Company, which was able to reduce its financial charges for the fifth consecutive year, with savings much higher than the Euribor reduction over the last five years, and able to close refinancing transactions throughout the year totalling 725 million euros.
In the 2008-2017 period, the most difficult years for our industry, Acerinox was the only company capable of cash generation of 3,081 million euros, thus being able to undertake investments
4

amounting to 1,771 million euros, rewarding our shareholders with 996 million euros and reducing the net financial debt by 314 million euros, thereby achieving a ratio of net debt over EBITDA of 1.2 and 31% leverage in 2017.
Finally, in this section devoted to the economic and business variables in 2017, I would like to highlight the fact that the strategic investments contained in the 2016-2020 strategic plan were completed. Thus, in October, in the presence of the Governor of Kentucky, the Ambassador of Spain in the USA and the entire Board of Directors of Acerinox, NAS officially opened its new BA (bright annealing) line dedicated to producing stainless steel, following an investment of 120 million euros. We also recently witnessed the launch of Acerinox Europa's new investments, valued at 140 million euros, which incorporate the most competitive technologies currently available around the world.
The evolution of our shares on the stock markets deserves particular mention. 2017 was preceded by a year in which our shares rose by 33.8%, constituting one of the best-performing securities in 2016. The first quarter of 2017 started in the same vein, with increases of up to 11%. The uncertainties concerning China and the confusing news regarding the potential trade war launched by the US administration, as well as the announcement of the joint venture by Allegheny and Tsingshan, put downward pressure on our shares, which ended the year at 11.9 euros, representing a fall of -5.5% in comparison with the 7.4% rise in the IBEX-35. However, if we compare the performances in the last two years, our shares appreciated by 26.5%, compared with the 5.2% rise in the IBEX-35. So far in 2018 (until 13 April), Acerinox's value has fallen by -2.75%, like the IBEX-35, as opposed to the falls registered by our European competitors of -7.05% and -27.2% respectively. Our expectations for the year, together with a suitable interpretation of the effect the measures ultimately implemented to protect our US business will have, lead us to believe that there will be a reinforcement of our value on the stock markets.
The Board of Directors has continued to work on improving and optimising our Company's Corporate Governance. In this regard, I would like to highlight the most significant events during the year: The number of meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees increased, focusing the Executive Committee's activity on the Company's strategy.
We assigned a greater female presence to the Board's Committees and 50% of the independent directors are women, accounting for a total of 26.6% of the Board and thereby practically fulfilling the recommendation of reaching a figure of 30% by 2020. At the same time, we assigned a greater presence of women to the Board's Committees.
The recommendation for an independent external expert to perform an evaluation of the functioning of the governing bodies was fulfilled during the year. A new remuneration policy was designed and approved for the Executive Directors and Senior Management, adjusting their compensation system to the suggestions made by the good governance recommendations and the voting
5

Letter from the Chairman
advisors. A new head of Prevention and Compliance was appointed, as well as a Risk manager to work in direct contact with the Board's Committees. Finally, the Audit Committee reinforced its operations during the year, becoming the most active committee. The 2017 accounts were audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in accordance with the agreement reached at the 2016 General Shareholders' Meeting and for the purposes of the scheduled rotation of the auditors.
With regard to the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, we made an extraordinary effort in both economic and human terms to undertake actions linked to our social commitment, our approach and our help for the communities and environments in which we conduct our activity. Our general policies, indicators and actions are perfectly outlined in the "Non-Financial Information Report" included in this document.
Once again, the Board of Directors will propose to the General Shareholders' Meeting the distribution of a dividend totalling 0.45 euros per share in a single effective payment in July, this being the second year of cash remuneration following four years in which a flexible dividend was used.
There are many uncertainties of an environmental, economic, geopolitical, social and technological nature hovering over our world. We also have to assimilate unexpected and surprising events such as Brexit, the results of elections in certain countries, with the emergence of populist ideas, and the application of economic measures which seemed to be things of the past. In spite of the above, the world economy has behaved strongly and we have performed throughout the world within a context of relative peace and tranquillity, but the most important factor for the future is that the forecast for the global economy over the coming two years is one of a sustained upturn (around 3.9%), with the emerging countries and developing economies growing at 5% and the advanced economies doing so at around 2.3%.
If these forecasts are confirmed, we can envisage entering a virtuous and positive cycle for our industry, subject, of course to its traditional risks: overcapacity, coming mainly from China, and the volatility inherent in the variables of our business. It appears that the former risk will be gradually neutralised, without ruling out occasional tensions, while the latter will remain among us, which is why we have to continue deploying policies, strategies and skills to manage it.
Acerinox is well-prepared to move around in the complex and uncertain environment it will experience in the future, with the improved geographical diversification in the sector, a good
6

product mix in the markets in which it operates, a good competitive position resulting from the investments made in recent years and a demanding culture that motivates us to seek continuous improvement. We will focus our endeavours on facing the future, continuing to improve our competitive position and ensuring we have an efficient, innovative and creative company, and so we will have to continue making the same effort as in the past and use the new tools being placed at our disposal by the technological revolution. Moreover, as we have done until now, we will maintain a healthy financial structure and a powerful culture, with rigorous work and permanent self-demand, for the purpose of retaining our leadership in the industry, obtaining increasing results over time and generating differential and attractive value for our shareholders, while respecting the environment, one of the fundamental pillars of our business model. I would like to finish by thanking the excellent management team for their work and endeavour and their desire to keep improving day after day. In addition, I feel compelled to express my acknowledgement of the 6,750 people who make up our human capital throughout four continents, because, with their daily work, we are truly capable of achieving the goals we set ourselves. My thanks also to our Board of Directors, for sparing no effort and devoting themselves to our corporate interests and, of course, to all our shareholders, for their trust and permanent support. Kind regards, Rafael Miranda Robredo Chairman

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
Dear Shareholders,
Once again I have the honour of writing to you to report on Acerinox's results for the 2017 financial year and to endeavour to explain the context within which we conducted our work.
A year ago we were saying that, despite the numerous uncertainties in the political and geostrategic fields, we had no doubt that the economic situation was improving and that we were going through a period of recovery, a view which has finally been confirmed.
In 2017, we witnessed how the process of economic recovery became firmly established, being chiefly boosted by the consumer goods sectors, given that, for one reason or another, there is still little investment in infrastructure or capital goods, which are highly dependent on the uncertainties emanating from the political situations in many countries.
Practically all the regions experienced growth. The Spanish GDP rose by 3.1% in 2017, while there were respective upturns in the European Union (2.5%), the United States (2.3%), the ASEAN area (5.3%) and China (6.9%), thus putting an end to the doubts concerning its ability to manage its economy. The emerging countries also experienced growth, as demonstrated by the figures of 1.3% in South Africa and 1.0% in Brazil.
Important sectors in the use of stainless steel recorded positive performances. Just one example was the manufacture of household appliances, which grew by 3.7% in the European Union, 5.8% in the United States and 10.9% in China.
The consumption of stainless steel continued to increase, and we believe it has done so in recent years with even more impetus than in the past. We constantly pride ourselves in manufacturing a good product, one which has maintained an annual growth rate of 5.9% since 1950 (the highest among metals and industrial alloys), but even this growth was surpassed in the 2008-2017 period, rising to 7.1%. Stainless steel continues to be given new applications in advanced economies, but above all, it is gaining ground in terms of everyday usage in emerging countries, keeping pace with a growing middle class, which needs to process and produce its food in a hygienic and healthy manner, enjoying the convenience that household appliances provide, and therefore, requiring more efficient vehicles to transport them and an increasingly developed industry.
8

This is good news for the sector, as it will soon absorb the surplus capacity around the world caused by the huge proliferation of factories in China, a country which manufactured just 3% of the world's stainless steel in 2001 but produced as much as 54% in 2017. We trust that the control of licences to build new plants, together with greater demands in environmental matters, the evolution of its economy towards transparency and the elimination of public subsidies will lead to a restoration of the balance in the world stainless steel market (and that of steel in general), thus making the trade wars and barriers emerging all over the planet unnecessary.
I must also make mention of the tensions arising from what we refer to as the "steel war", although these have occurred in 2018. While it is true that the decision by the United States to impose tariffs on all imports of steel products is a cause for concern and may have unexpected consequences, it is also true that the problem of excess production capacity has been dealt with decisively.
China was conscious of the strategic nature of steel when it decided to promote its production, and now that it manufactures more than half the world's steel and a large number of steel products, other regions are becoming aware that they cannot dispense with local industry and have to promote it, especially considering how the latter has succumbed to the competition generated as a result of changing the rules of the game.
The United States is not the first country to have protected its steel industry, as we are also faced with protectionist measures in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and China itself.
In any case, with factories in four continents and a far-reaching business network that sells our products in 85 countries, Acerinox is undoubtedly the group which is best-positioned in the stainless steel industry to address this new "globalization with barriers".
The increase in consumption and the excess capacity within the sector were the key factors affecting business throughout the year, bringing about a scenario of an increase in sales but a lowering of prices, which meant it was essential to implement cost controls to achieve targets. The third significant factor was the volatility of commodity prices. The effect of nickel on the stainless steel industry has now been combined with the strong impact of ferrochrome. China is once again the main player, as it has become the largest ferrochrome manufacturer in the world, not because of its domestic chrome reserves, but due to the ore it imports from other countries, chiefly South Africa.
It just so happened that Chinese stocks of chrome ore and ferrochrome were at very low levels by late 2016 and demand for stainless steel began to grow in early 2017, while these inventories also stood below their usual levels. This led to a sharp rise in both chrome and stainless steel
9

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
prices and extraordinary profits for the Acerinox Group, as it was able to capitalize on its opportunities both in purchasing commodities and selling the finished product.
Our melting production in the first quarter was the highest of the year, standing at 668,000 tonnes, as was the turnover of 1,252 million euros, the EBITDA of 191 million euros and the profits after taxes and minority interests totalling 98 million euros.
Once the stocks in the markets had been replenished by the end of the quarter, the situation began to return to normal from April onwards, consequently, prices fell and our sales slowed, as did our profits. Melting production was 605,000 tonnes in the second quarter, in anticipation of a further worsening of market conditions. The EBITDA in the second quarter was 126 million euros and profits after taxes and minority interests totalled 53 million euros, with sales amounting to 1,191 million euros.
Once again, doubts concerning the sustainability of the Chinese economy had a marked effect, in view of the sharp growth of 6.8% in the first half of 2017, and these doubts were reflected in a certain rush to reduce stocks and further drops in the prices of raw materials ­ nickel, and especially, ferrochrome ­ the latter losing all the gains recorded in the first part of the year. Stainless steel prices suffered as a result and our sales fell to 1,067 million euros in the third quarter, the year's lowest figure. Our melting production, totalling 615,000 tonnes, was not so badly affected, as we had previously made cutbacks, but the reduced prices brought our EBITDA down to 53 million euros and our profits to barely 7 million euros, the quarterly lows for the year.
Despite market nervousness, the satisfactory situation of real consumption brought normality back to commodity and stainless steel prices in the fourth quarter, a circumstance we capitalized on by increasing production to 631,000 tonnes. Greater confidence in the economy boosted the price of nickel, a metal for which a great future is envisaged owing to its increasing use in electric car batteries. The turnover for the fourth quarter was 1,116 million euros, the EBITDA stood at 119 million euros and profits after taxes and minority interests totalled 77 million euros.
It is noticeable how we suffered from the surpluses of the first quarter in the third, finally achieving an average EBITDA of 122 million euros per quarter, a value which is very close to the real ones in the second and fourth quarters and our target for the year. Logically, this tremendous volatility makes daily management difficult, and our full attention is required for any commodity purchasing process, for production scheduling at the various factories and for the management of our stocks and sales.
For this reason, we are proud to have achieved sales totalling 4,627 million euros in 2017, 17% more than in 2016, a 49% increase in the EBITDA (489 million euros) and profits after taxes and minority interests amounting to 234 million euros, which represents an almost threefold increase year on year. These results are the best we have achieved in the last ten years, marked by the 2008 economic and financial crisis.
10

Our melting production was the second largest in our history at 2,518,919 tonnes, just 67,000 tonnes below our record. In cold rolling we achieved a new high of 1,738,240 tonnes, with all units performing well.
Particular mention should be made of the fiscal reform in the United States, our main market, which led to an improvement in our net returns at the end of the year as a result of the adjustment of the deferred tax liabilities to the new tax rate. Above all, this will improve our profits and our cash flow situation in the coming years.
Despite Acerinox's positive results, the numerous uncertain political situations which affected the economy and the sector did not help the company's shares to maintain the good progress displayed in 2016, when their value increased by 34%. In 2017, the share price dropped by 5%, and rest assured, we are devoting considerable efforts to transmitting the hope that the stability of our economic growth will enable us to demonstrate the Company's true value.
In 2017, we started up the new production lines at our American subsidiary, North American Stainless, with a new cold rolling mill and a BA-finish bright annealing line, and we were honoured to have them opened by Governor Bevin, Kentucky's highest authority, accompanied at the ceremony by Acerinox's Board of Directors, local authorities and a large number of company employees. The investment totalled 120 million euros.
Throughout 2017, we built the new Acerinox Europa lines in Spain, a new cold rolling mill, a cutting line and an annealing and pickling line, which underwent their testing phase in the first quarter of 2018. This investment amounted to 140 million euros.
Both were pioneering cases within the market and helped us establish ourselves as technological frontrunners in our sector, putting us in an excellent position to strive for an improvement in the economic cycle. This infrastructure incorporates the latest in stainless steel production technology, modern mathematical models to adapt to production requirements and all the sensors required for comprehensive control of operations, in other words, all the essentials for data capture in order to make the most of our digital transformation.
We are large consumers of technology, and in addition, we have allocated 14 million euros to our own R&D&I endeavours. We are convinced that the gathering of data on the process throughout the supply chain, and subjecting it to advanced analysis, will enable us to continue to move forward in terms of efficiency, quality, and the overall pursuit of excellence.
With these improvements in innovation, we invested 173 million euros in the important process lines mentioned above, other technical improvements and the upgrades of our equipment in 2017. The cash flow totalling 366 million euros generated during the year also allowed us to return the dividend in cash in the amount of 124 million euros.
Acerinox's net financial debt was reduced by 11 million euros to 609 million euros, a figure representing only 1.2 times the EBITDA, which will enable us to deal calmly with any upheaval in the economy.
11

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer
In 2017, taking advantage of the good condition of the financial market, we refinanced 725 million euros by extending maturities and reducing the cost of financing, which fell by 35% throughout the year in comparison with 2016.
The importance we give to our Excellence Plans ­ which enable us to work together towards the difficult objectives of accomplishing more with fewer means and increasing our sales and profits by minimizing the resources used ­ plays a key role in the control of working capital, the improvement of the efficiency of the production process and the Group's competitiveness. In the ninth year these plans have been implemented (the first year in the case of the 2017-2018 plan), we have achieved 49% of our goal of achieving annual recurring savings of 50 million euros, in addition to those achieved in previous years.
All these efforts are currently more important than ever in offsetting the increases in the main costs involved in stainless steel manufacture by means of efficiency and productivity, given the better prospects for the economic situation. Once again, I am obliged to draw your attention to the high prices of electrical power in Spain, which are increasingly higher than those enjoyed by our closest European competitors. If we truly believe in the importance of industry in our country, if we have really learnt that the countries with the strongest industries are those which are better equipped to face difficult times, then we have no choice but to commit to the supply of electrical power at competitive prices.
Spain requires a commitment to industry, and that industry requires competitive electrical power to generate wealth and create jobs. We will not go into too many technicalities such as the tariff deficit, the compensation of renewable energy costs, tolls, insularity, interruptibility and marginal production costs. We simply demand a final price which enables us to compete on equal terms, because the Spanish steel industry has already demonstrated that it is one of the most efficient in the world, and it would be a shame not to take full advantage of these qualities.
The year just ended was the first in which we audited our sustainability report, in which you will be able to find the large number of contributions we made to improving the environment, to supporting the communities we operate in, to cooperating with universities and training and research centres and to furthering our employees' professional development.
In this final section, it is well worth mentioning the fact that we have managed to reduce the accident rate within our Group and thereby achieve a new record. When we talk about excellence in our operations, we refer to many concepts such as efficiency, productivity and quality, but none are as important as excellence in terms of safety. No production process can be described as excellent if it is not safe for our workers.
12

We have also continued to make progress in matters of corporate governance, complying with most of the recommendations of the Code of Good Governance and thus becoming an example of transparency and good practices. We trust that all these tools will help us to convey the principle of honesty and the culture of endeavour which have formed part of Acerinox since its foundation to our shareholders and all the Company's stakeholders. We have attempted to reflect all the above in this Annual Report 2017, which I recommend you read. I sincerely thank everyone for their support, and in particular, I sincerely thank the entire Acerinox team for their efforts, dedication, commitment and enthusiasm in continuing to learn and improve. All this, together with the trust they show me every day, encourages me to continue striving to make Acerinox an industry leader, a company worth committing to and one which contributes to society. In particular, I would like to thank the management team and my immediate associates for their unconditional loyalty and support, and I hope, with the work and effort of the whole Acerinox Group, that we can continue to deserve the trust all of you show - shareholders, customers, suppliers and fellow workers in general. Many thanks to all of you. Yours faithfully, Bernardo Velázquez Chief Executive Officer

The Acerinox Europa factory is one of the most modern and ef cient stainless steel plants on the continent. It was the rst integrated plant in the Group and the rst in the world to produce stainless steel. The experience acquired here was vital in the development of the ones that followed.
The constant investment and expansion of the factory and its equipment will continue in 2018 with the opening of an annealing and pickling (AP) line and a cold rolling mill, as well as all the auxiliary installations, which represent an investment of 140 million euros.
In terms of the environment, the Board of Directors recently approved an investment of 6.6 million euros to reduce the environmental impact of the plant, with measures such as closing the scrap warehouses and furnaces, improvements in AOD and lighting rigs, and the installation of wind panels, among other things.

North American Stainless, the plant with the highest production and pro tability of the Group, where Acerinox has invested 2,300 million euros since it started there in 1990, is the leader in the United States, becoming a global reference for competitiveness and technological progress.
NAS is the clear leader in the American market, it casts nearly half of all the stainless steel in the United States, and is one of the few integrated plants on the continent.
This consolidated leadership of the internal market has been joined since 2017 by its status as the only bright nish stainless steel manufacturer in the country. This new expansion of the factory was possible because of the
start of the BA bright annealing line, as well as a cold rolling mill, which was the result of an investment by the Group of more than 120 million euros.

Columbus Stainless, in which Acerinox S.A holds 76% of the shares and the Government of South Africa the other 24% through IDC (Industrial Development Corporation), is the clear leader in the whole African continent and especially in its main market, South Africa. Besides being the main supplier of stainless steel for the domestic market, Columbus exports material to the ve continents. Few industrial groups can boast of a market share of nearly 50% across a whole continent, Africa.
The plant ended 2017 positively, with increased production in the steelworks and hot rolled steel, along with the new approval by the Board of Directors for the installation of a new slitter cutting line, requiring an investment by the Group of ve million euros and, apart from supplying to the local market, will enable it to increase exports with product cut to the client's measures.
The geographical location of Columbus gives it a considerable commercial advantage, because it is close to areas where chrome is mined and transformed, considerably reducing its production costs.

Acerinox achieved its best results of the last ten years, with pro ts of 234 million euros, and a 16.6% increase in net sales, up to 4,627 million euros.
2017 ended with improved margins and record production gures thanks to excellent operations and the optimisation of capacity.
Healthy demand in the main global economies has allowed the stainless steel sector to grow.
In 2017, Acerinox obtained its highest pro ts of the last decade. The company ended the nancial year with a result, after tax and minority interests, of 234 million euros, 191.5% more than the previous year. Net sales for the year rose to 4,627 million euros, 16.6% more than the previous year. The growth of this revenue was due especially to an astute price management policy in all markets, with the transfer of increased costs of raw materials into the price of nished products. These results underline the special signi cance of the operating strategy of the company and its optimisation of its production capacity, but another important factor was the savings achieved by the Excellence Plans. The good performance of the markets, the positive impact of the tax reforms passed in the United States and the changes in the price of raw materials were other factors that contributed to these pro ts. An EBITDA totalling 489 million euros was generated, 48.6% higher than in the same period last year, with a sales margin of 10.6%. In 2017, Acerinox achieved its historical record for the production of cold rolled steel since it started production in 1970. It was also its second best year for steel production and hot rolling. The volume of stainless steel produced increased compared to the previous year in all workshops, and one gure worth noting among all the others was the 33% increase in production at Bahru Stainless. The price of nickel, which has a strong impact on the stainless steel market, was volatile during 2017, reaching the lowest levels of 2016 (when it reached the region of 8,700 euros per ton) in the month of June, and the highest level of recent years (12,300 euros per ton) in the month of December.

3.1 The Stainless Steel Market
According to the data available, the market for stainless steel exceeded the initial growth forecasts that were set at around 4%. Based on the data from the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF) the growth up to September was at 7.4%, whilst our own estimates put growth for the whole year at around 5.7%, with the Annual Compound Growth Rate since 1950 unaltered at 5.9%. Stainless steel remains a product with one of the highest growth rates and continues to break into new applications that take advantage of its remarkable qualities. Prices started the year with rises driven by increases in the cost of raw materials, reaching their peak between the end of the rst and start of the second quarters before falling back in the second and third quarters, only to recover again at the end of the year. The reason for the decline in raw material prices seems to be connected once again with the uncertainty about the growth of the Chinese economy and the reduction in activity that the Communist Party Congress in November was expected to cause. This did not occur, and the result was the recovery at the end of the year.

3.1.1 Europe Following the sharp increase in apparent consumption of at product in Europe in 2016, (8.7%), in 2017, the trend was con rmed and apparent consumption rose again by 0.7% to 5.37 million tons, close to the historic record of 2006, indicating that the crisis in Europe is nally over.
According to our estimates, the European country with the highest increase in consumption was Poland, with an increase of 5.9%, followed closely by Spain with 4.6%, where apparent consumption is still 15% below the highest levels of 2006. Among the other countries, the situation of the UK is worth noting. After the steep fall last year caused by Brexit, its levels remained stable in 2017, ending with a slight decline of 0.5%. In the other major EU countries, Germany rose by 0.4% while Italy and France fell by 1.9% and 1.7% respectivily.
Imports of at product continued to rise by 17.9%, with the imports share rising from 23% in 2016 to 27% in 2017. Imports of cold rolled products rose by 15.7%, whilst hot rolled products rose by 24.4%, driven by the imports of hot rolled coil from China for the large steel transformers in the Italian market.
The strong demand noted in the rst quarter of the year led to an increase in inventory, which would only return to the average levels of previous years in September, ending the year with adequate levels.
The Acerinox Group consolidated its position in important markets such as Turkey and Russia, which continued to grow at a high pace.
Base prices were stable in the rst four months, but later deteriorated towards the end of the third quarter. They gradually recovered during the fourth quarter, which triggered optimism towards the start of 2018.

Real consumption remained strong, and key sectors for stainless steel such as construction con rmed the trend of 2016. According to estimates from Eurofer (February 2018), the construction sector grew by 4.3%, automotive continued as strongly as in recent years and grew by 3.7%, in line with the home appliances industry, which also grew by 3.7%.
3.1.2 Americas Real consumption of the American market maintained sustained growth, the construction industry grew by more than 4% once again, for the third year running according to the Census Bureau. The domestic appliance sector also grew by 5.8%, according to AHAM, while production and sales in the automotive sector suffered corrections of -2.5% and -1.7% (both gures from Light Vehicles Wards), although this means that levels actually remained high, considering that 2016 had been a record year.
According to the latest available data, the at product market grew by 3% in 2017. Meanwhile, the reactivation of the Oil & Gas industry revived the market for long product, which grew by more than 20% to compensate for the fall of -13.6% in 2016.
Inventories were constant throughout 2017, but below the average of recent years. The base prices of the American market were fairly stable throughout the year, while variations in raw materials affected the alloy surcharge.

Both Canada and Mexico registered increases of apparent consumption of at products, with consumption in the latter country continuing to grow strongly thanks to sectors such as automotive.

Acerinox in 2017
3.1.3 Africa and Middle East The apparent consumption of at products in South Africa fell by 6.9% in 2017 according to our estimates, re ecting problems in the economy and political instability, although there was a recovery in the last months of the year in sectors such as mining, which could lead to further rises in consumption of stainless steel. As part of its business strategy, and to compensate the weakness of the local market, Columbus continued to increase the number of countries to which it exports to reach a total of 67 countries. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates stands out as the largest market and the best performing country in the region (where the Group has an of ce in Dubai). It is also worth mentioning the growth of African markets of Morocco and Algeria, where Acerinox is the market leader. 3.1.4 Asia The largest stainless steel market, China, increased its apparent consumption again, by 7.2%, according to data from the China Stainless Steel Council. The increase in production was caused by growth of internal consumption, as exports stabilized. This growing balance between internal demand and capacity in China makes us optimistic about its reduction of excess capacity. Evolution of prices in the Chinese market was similar to other markets throughout the year, although always lower, putting pressure on the international market, especially in the ASEAN region. The year ended with low inventories in Wuxi and Foshan, in levels below average in recent years. This may contribute to an improvement in prices at the start of 2018.

3.2 Global Production of Stainless Steel
According to the available data from ISSF (International Stainless Steel Forum) to September, production in these nine months rose by 7.4% in comparison with the same period of 2016.
While waiting for de nitive gures for the fourth quarter, we estimate a yearly total growth of around 5.7% in 2017.
According to these estimates, world steel production in 2017 was 48.1 million tons.

Excellence Plan V (2017-2018) is currently under way in the Acerinox Group. The rst year of application ended with 49% completion of the total recurring savings target forecast of 50 million euros. Therefore, in the same conditions, the same characteristics and circumstances as the 2016 nancial year, this would imply a saving of 24.6 million euros.
The current Plan, approved by the Board of Directors in December 2016, has 20 chapters which look for improvements in areas such as manufacturing, ef ciency, exibility and customer service.
Excellence Plans are a tool for improving production costs along the whole supply chain, resulting from a benchmarking exercise of the best practices in each of the processes and units in the Group. These plans are an essential management tool both for the different companies as well the management of the Group. They have achieved important successes since 2009, when they were rst implemented.
Each plan is put forward with the aim and criteria of optimizing and making improvements on the previous ones, so that the accumulated savings to date are consolidated and form the basis of the next plan.
The different plans applied have registered recurring savings of 97 million euros in Plan I (2009-2010), 53 million in Plan II (2011-2012), 53 million euros in Plan III (2013-2014) and 50 million euros in Plan IV (2015-2016).

Acerinox Europa will also open new lines in the rst months of 2018. After a total investment of 140 million euros, of which 111 were invested last year, the plant will start up a new annealing and pickling (AP) line and a cold rolling mill. A new slitting line, which is already working, completes these investments. This will improve the quality of its products, reduce costs and the environmental impact. In both cases, these are strategic investments approved by the Board of Directors in 2015 in order to boost and reinforce the leadership of Acerinox in North America and to improve its position in the European Market. For the South African plant, Columbus Stainless, the Board of Directors of Acerinox approved an investment of 5 million euros in December 2017 for the installation of a new slitter line that will improve the service it offers its customers and reduce delivery times. The Group invested 11 million euros in this plant last year. The global amount of investments, as shown in the graph accompanying the text, rose to 173 million euros in 2017, a similar sum to the previous year, in which maintenance investments are included to equip the installations with the most advanced technology and equipment.

3.6 Raw Materials
The recovery of industrial production entailed an increase in consumption that pushed the prices of raw materials upwards in 2017. As usual, demand in China was an important factor in the movement of some raw materials during the year.

Nickel The price of nickel followed a downward trend in the rst half of the year. The announcement of the partial lifting of the veto on nickel ore exports from Indonesia, with the consequent potential rise in pig nickel production in China, together with the uncertainty about the resilience of Chinese economic growth led to a drop in prices to the minimum annual price of 8,700 USD/mt in June.
This was a turning point, and prices rose in the second half of the year. The announcement of nickel production caps combined with healthy demand, especially in China, were the basis of the recovery of the prices, which rose over 12,000 USD/mt, levels not seen since July 2015. Besides these factors, the positions taken by nancial investors in the metals exchange, due to the interest in nickel as a component in batteries for electric cars, caused the price to rise to higher levels in the last months of the year, although with greater volatility. Nickel prices reached their highest point in November, at 12,800 USD/mt, before ending the year at 12,200 USD/mt.

Despite the increase in the production of pig nickel in China and Indonesia in 2017, consumption was stronger than production of this metal for the second year running, leading to an estimated de cit of 128,000 mt at the end of the year, reducing the stocks available on the market.
Stock on the LME fell by 5,454 mt, ending the year at 366,612 mt. The reduction on the Shanghai Exchange was even more pronounced, 49,096 mt to 44,216 mt, at the end of the year.
Despite the recovery of the prices in the second half of the year, nickel was the metal which saw the least movement, with an increase of 20.1% during 2017. The highest increase was for aluminium with 31.7%, followed by zinc with 29.6% and copper with 28.4%.

Ferrochrome The price of ferrochrome has been one of the most volatile in recent years. It started the year with an annual high in the rst quarter, when it reached 165 US¢/Lb, which it had not reached since the second quarter of 2008. This steep rise was driven by the changes in the Chinese market. Low stocks of both chrome ore for local production and ferrochrome at the end of 2016 in China caused prices to rise steadily and affected global prices in all markets.
Prices started to fall back as the process of restocking wound down, reaching 154 US¢/Lb in the second quarter.
It was in the third quarter, when stocks had been fully replenished, that the low global demand sent the prices strongly downward, ending up at 110 US¢/Lb. The recovery of demand after the summer saw prices improve reaching 139 US¢/Lb for the fourth quarter. Obviously, this volatility makes managing our stocks dif cult and increases uncertainty.

Molybdenum The sharp cuts in production during 2015 and 2016 meant that demand improved and created a mild de cit that enabled prices to rise in the rst months of the year, reaching 9 USD/Lb at the start of April.
This recovery of the prices stimulated an increase in production, especially in China, but the fall in demand in the second quarter forced prices down to their annual minimum of 6.85 US¢/Lb in June.
The improvement anticipated in the second half of the year led distributors to start a process of replenishing their stocks. Prices did recover at the end of July and remained stable at around 8.5 US¢/Lb. The continued rise in demand, especially in China, made it possible for prices to rise strongly at the end of the year, reaching over 10 US¢/Lb at the end of December, its highest level in the last three years.

Ferric Scrap The price of scrap was stable in the rst half of the year, at around 250 USD/mt. It started to rise steadily at the end of June as a result of the strong activity of the main importers like Turkey, which even imported scrap from Oceania for the rst time. Prices reached average levels of 320 USD/mt in August. We have to go back as far as 2014 to nd similar prices.
The uncertainty generated in the market by the shortage of electrodes, and doubts about whether production could be sustained led to a sharp correction as prices tumbled to 280 USD/mt. Despite this, the improved demand and replenishment of stocks prior to the winter period have enabled prices to recover, so that they reached their annual high in December.

The workforce increased by 2.6% since the implementation of new lines which has increased production. Acerinox considers its reliance on internal promotion a strategic issue, leading to low turnover in the workforce and rewards for hard work and dedication, principles reinforced and emphasised by the Management. This approach to Human Resources has created a strong feeling of loyalty and pride at forming part of the company. The foundation of this relation is the fact that the contracts of Acerinox employees are inde nite, in 90% of cases, and always of high quality, with professional development, opportunities for promotion and are well-paid.

Acerinox offers opportunities to learn and overcome professional challenges. The company places special emphasis on aptitudes for teamwork and learning for worker development, acknowledging proposals and initiatives and a proactive attitude among the workforce. All these characteristics and values can explain the low turnover of personnel among the Group's companies, even in countries where the culture of job mobility is deeply ingrained.

In order to nd and retain talent, the companies of the Group have agreements with over 30 universities in Spain, the USA, Malaysia and South Africa.
The Group values gender diversity for the creation of value and promotes exchanges between technicians from all its factories and sales of ces located in different countries, with the aim of achieving the best practices by means of benchmarking and cultural exchange.

3.8 R+D+i
Each of the processes of production, distribution and sale of stainless steel, as well as management, require constant effort in research, development and innovation.
From the purchase of raw materials to the nal delivery to the client, with all the equipment needed to manufacture the nished product, the transport and optimal routes for moving it, the most appropriate places for storing it and the delivery models are all tasks in which the use of technology and analysis of data and programmes is of vital importance.
Steel making requires constant investment in new equipment, in the use of the latest technology and the monitoring of production processes.
For this reason, the amounts dedicated to investment in the factories in the last decade add up to more than 160 million euros on average each year. It is a signi cant nancial and human effort which is also intrinsically linked to the values of the company and those who form part of it, dedicated to nding new answers that enable us to face new challenges and discover opportunities for business and improvement.
The 13.59 million euros that were invested directly in R+D+i include the 6.9 million euros that Acerinox Europa invested in the acquisition of new technological equipment to enhance the output of the new production lines. North American Stainless invested another 5.4 million in R+D for the same purpose as the Spanish plant. Columbus Stainless invested 343,304 euros.
The different research laboratories that the company has are dedicated to nding better and more pro table alloys and research into new applications for the products, continuously developing innovations to obtain different product nishes and certi cations of the physical properties and composition of steel.
Besides improving the different production workshops in the plants and the tools used in the company, most of their work is aimed at enhancing the qualities of stainless steel and looking for new applications and markets where it can be used, as well as increasing production capacity, optimising each of the phases and expanding the range of products made by the company, reducing where possible consumption and costs generated by the activity, and its environmental impact.
The R+D+i within the company is not limited to just one department but is in each production phase so that the majority of the staff participates in it. Therefore, the company awards each year, through the Rafael Naranjo Awards, which have a total economic endowment for all categories of 45,000 euros, the best ideas to improve the quality of the product and the process.
In the 2017 edition, the rst prize of "Quality in Progress", endowed with 15,000 euros, fell to the TLC Mechanical Maintenance Group, for its project Elimination of Apron Mobile accidents in the hot rolling mill nisher.
The second prize in this category was awarded to work `Modi cation of gasi ers in the pools of the steel mill', prepared by Francisco García Olivares, who has been rewarded with 10,000 euros. For third place, the jury awarded 5,000 euros to Juan Carlos Enríquez Baladez and Cristóbal Aguera Fernández for their project `Improvements to diversion bucket. Improvements in spouts and arms `.

Acerinox in 2017
In the category of Safety awards, the project was the winner `Buzas', prepared by Matías Sánchez Valentín, who will therefore receive 10,000 euros.
In the Environment section, the award was for the `Geolocated and monitored online PH meter for environmental emergencies', signed by Sergio Pelayo Jimeno and awarded 5,000 euros. In this section, the members of the Committee have also wanted to make a special mention to the nalist project `Reduction of particulate and fume emissions in the steelworks by exploiting the oxyfuel extractor' developed by Jonathan Domínguez Vélez, and given the success of this program it has been decided to extend it to all the factories.
The Group also convened the second edition of the Acerinox Prize in 2017, organized by the Association for the Development of Stainless Steel (Cedinox). The student of Industrial Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Almudena Menéndez González, was awarded the Acerinox Prize for her work, `Functionalization of surfaces using LIPSS with femtosecond laser'.
The jury awarded this study about an application in development for surface treatment using stainless steel (among other metals) laser, with promising possibilities for future use in surface staining and its properties hydrophobic, which can contribute to increase the advantages of the stainless steel in various applications. The award is accompanied by a cash prize of 3,000 euros and is delivered in the presence of all the members of the jury and the Acerinox management in a public ceremony.
In addition, Cedinox, supervised in its entirety by Acerinox, taught courses in the 2016-2017 academic year to 1,415 students from 19 engineering and architecture schools.

3.9 Digital Transformation
Digitalization is not only changing the way people interact within society, but it also poses a challenge for companies in how they adapt their business models to be more competitive. In November 2017, the Acerinox management presented the Digital Transformation strategy to the Board of Directors. The objective is to give value to the information and knowledge that exists in the Group in order to improve the operational excellence of the entire value chain, enhance the brand image and create a new way of working in which professionals have of tools that allow them to be more effective and make better decisions. The Group's strategy has drawn a roadmap for the next few years in which the following projects are identi ed:
1). Optimization in transportation contracting through data analytics 2). Improvement of energy ef ciency through the identi cation of opportunities in the production process
with Big Data tools 3). Pilot projects in the new production lines to add sensors to critical parts with the objective of capturing
signals that allow their subsequent study 4). Platforms that will allow cross integrate data of operation in order to achieve more predictive
management models in the areas of maintenance and quality 5). Integrated planning from the purchase of raw materials to the sale of nal product thus increasing
customer service In order to prepare the organization to face this transformation, collaborations with universities and technology centres have been strengthened in order to incorporate pro les with the necessary capabilities. In 2017, the rst year of life of the Chair of Connected Industry was completed, of which Acerinox is a sponsor, along with other relevant industrial and technological companies. During this period, we have shared how to approach data analytics projects, what professional pro les are going to be demanded in the future by companies and how it affects security in a hyperconnected environment.

Acerinox in 2017
3.10 Risk Management
All business activity involves internal and external risks which must be adequately managed.
Acerinox, S.A. has implemented a risk management model, designed to identify, classify, and assess the potential risks that can affect all units and relevant functions of the Organization, with the ultimate aim of managing them and providing a reasonable assurance on the achievement of the objectives, be they strategic, operational, compliance or information.
The Group's governing bodies have implemented a risk management process throughout the organization, as part of the usual management activities, based on the principles of ef ciency, commitment, leadership, compliance, transparency and supervision.
The heads of all the units carry out an analysis of the potential events that involve risks, thus creating an inventory of risks and carrying out their preliminary taxonomy. To measure its probability and impact, qualitative and quantitative techniques are used based on the knowledge, judgement and experience of the people involved, sometimes complemented with the corresponding actuarial technique. The Management Committee of Acerinox, SA supervises the evaluations and the conclusions reached.
For the graphic representation, a heat map is used that allows great visibility and comparability, allowing the identi cation of the relevant units of the Group and their impact, probability and risk assessments, as well as serving as a basis for the determination of appetite rules and thresholds of controlled admissibility of those.
The Director of Corporate Risk Management, under the direct supervision of the Chief Executive Of cer, analyses, evaluates and, where appropriate, proposes to the latter the update of the risk map and the response of the mitigation measures.
The company has grouped the relevant risks into six essential categories, which have minor sections. The total number of covered sections is 60, as of 31 December 2017, and each of them has mitigation or neutralization measures.
Like other companies in the sector, which make their list of most relevant risks public, the Acerinox Group sees the volatility of raw materials at the present time, the impact that the economic crisis has had on the industrial sector, the existence of overcapacity worldwide (especially in the factories of the People's Republic of China), the abnormally high competition in the sector (consequence of the previous risk). To all of them, the Group's management committee and the Director of Corporate Risk Management devote all their attention.

All this proves the high levels of ef ciency achieved in this period, which was particularly complicated for the sector.
With respect to the previous period, with a growth in turnover of 16.6%, it improved the EBITDA by 48.6%. The result after tax, 234 million euros, almost triples that of 2016.

This result is particularly commendable in a year marked by high volatility in raw materials, which had highly signi cant consequences within the market and on prices.
The exceptional rst quarter was compensated for by an equally abnormal third quarter, this time due to its weakness. This volatility, which is so harmful for the sector, not only affects results, but also has consequences for the receipt of orders, for apparent consumption, and for the consolidation of improvements in prices attained.

The satisfactory surge in investment in the USA and the advances state of those of Campo de Gibraltar, together with the rest of the plants, resulted in a payment of 185 million euros for the period. As a result, the free cash ow generated in the period was 181 million, which allowed the payment of a cash-only dividend of 124 million euros.
The Acerinox Group, in the most complicated period for the industry, was capable of generating 3,081 million euros, which allowed it to undertake investments for 1,771 million euros, pay the shareholders 996 million euros, and reduce the net nancial debt by 314 million euros. There was not another manufacturer in the industry in this period which was capable of maintaining its strategic investment plan and its policy of shareholder remuneration, while at the same time reducing its debt.

The Group is exposed to uctuations within the dollar due to the signi cance of its investments in North American Stainless and Bahru Stainless. For that reason, despite the good results from the period, equity was reduced by 9.1%, and non-current assets by 8.9%.
The net nancial debt, which fell by 11 million euros, would have seen a signi cantly greater fall were it not for a depreciation in cash positions held in dollar, which had a 62 million euros effect. Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ratio is 1.2 times.

4.4 Financing
During the 2017 period, the Group proceeded with the re nancing of its debt, with the aim of extending due dates, reducing costs and improving the quality of the debt. Overall operations were closed for a total of 725 million euros, of which 430 were aimed at reducing the cost of existing finance, and 295 million euros were new operations at a very competitive cost. Of these, 160 million euros has a maturity period equal to or greater than 7 years. The bulk of the debt is covered by a xed rate, and practically all of it is free of covenants. In addition, Columbus Stainless renegotiated and restructured the borrowing base facility of 3,500 million South African rand, in an operation that not only extended the maturity period, but also modi ed speci c conditions in the structure in order to provide Columbus with greater nancial exibility, while reducing the cost, and increasing the number of intervening banks to 11. The nal maturity date for the operation is June 2020.

Financial Report
The good macroeconomic and business data encouraged investors to opt for the stock market. Geopolitical tensions, such as the tension between the USA and North Korea, had a one-off effect. The role of the central banks was also decisive, as they began a new more restrictive phase. While the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, the Central European Bank (CEB) prepared the market for a reduction in the volume of debt purchase from 2018.
In relation to European stock markets, the Italian FTSE Mib stood out among the main European markets, with a growth of 13.6%, thanks to the pull of nancial securities, followed by the German Dax, with a 12.5% rise closing at a record high thanks to the healthy state of exporters. The French Cac also grew 9.3%, in a year in which President Macron put aside the fear of populism. The rise of 7.4% in the Ibex positioned it behind the 7.6% of the British FTSE 100.
In the United States the escalation was even greater. Markets closed in the region of historic highs. The Nasdaq closed the year with a growth of 28.2%, followed by 25.1% from the Dow Jones and 19.4% from S&P 500. The S&P 500 closed every month of the year positively for the rst time since 1988, with volatility below 10% during more than 200 sessions, in what is a 50 year record.

Acerinox

With respect to Acerinox shares, following a 2016 in which value rose by 33.8%, there was a good start to the year (up to +11.0% on 3 March). Following the publication of the good results from the first quarter, investors reaped pro ts due to the good performance of the shares to that point, and moved on to other sectors. From August, and coinciding with a rise in the price of raw materials, the interest from the investment community grew, returning the share price to levels above 12 euros (12.6 euros on 1 November).

The announcement of the joint venture by Allegheny and Tsingshan (on 2 November) and uncertainty in China, once again put pressure on the share price to fall, and it closed the year at 11.9 euros, signifying a fall of 5% with respect to the previous year.
This downward trend was not exclusively for Acerinox, but the entire stainless steel sector was affected, as can be seen in the following graph which shows the evolution of the Acerinox share price, the Ibex35, and European competitors:

4.8 Shareholder Remuneration

Following the years 2013 to 2016, in which Acerinox offered its shareholders the option of a exible dividend, the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 1 June 2017 agreed to make a single payment of 0.45 euros per share in cash, which was paid to shareholders on 5 July 2017.
Since 2006, Acerinox has remunerated its shareholders without interruption with an annual sum of 0.45 euros per share, whether through a cash dividend or exible dividend.
On 15 June 2015 Acerinox purchased one hundred treasury shares to use, where necessary, in the exchange of subscription rights in the implementation of the exible dividend. No movements with treasury shares have been made after the aforementioned date of acquisition.

4.9 Outlook
The recent tax reform in the United States will have a clearly positive effect on the results of Acerinox. To anticipate the behaviour of the Group in 2018, it will be necessary to be very aware of the possible protective measures in that country, of the reaction of Europe and other countries if these measures were adopted and of the management of the excess installed production capacity, especially in Asia. Regarding this issue, growth in production in Indonesia is particularly important, but also the closing of mills in China or their change of activity towards the manufacture of carbon steel. Once again flexibility, efficiency and cost control will be key factors that will determine the results of Acerinox, for which we trust in the increase of competitiveness achieved in the last few years and in the current improvement plans. The good situation of the economy in practically all countries should boost the consumption of stainless steel, especially if investments in infrastructure are reactivated and a phase of expansion of public spending is entered, as private consumption and production of capital goods are showing positive performances. Although the comparison with the year 2017 will start being negative due to the exceptional results obtained in the rst quarter of the previous year, favoured by the sharp increases in prices of raw materials, the current situation, together with the control of stocks in the main consumer markets and the recovery of prices in the fourth quarter, allows us to be optimistic for the year 2018. The alloy surcharges are rising and the base prices have already improved in the United States.

Corporate Governance and compliance
5. Corporate Governance and compliance
The Acerinox Annual Corporate Governance Report for the 2017 period forms part of the Management Report which includes a section on non- nancial information, in accordance with provisions of Royal Decree-Law 18/2017 on non- nancial information. The Management Report is available on the web page of the National Stock Market Commission ("Comisión Nacional de Mercado de Valores" in Spanish) and on the Acerinox web page since the date of publication of the annual accounts.
In 2015, the Acerinox Group, through its listed company Acerinox, S.A., began a major process of adapting its corporate governance to the provisions of the recent Spanish Capital Companies Law, as well as to the recommendations made in the new Corporate Governance Report for Spanish Listed Companies.
These modi cations have in essence meant an improvement in corporate governance, through the strengthening of the role of the Board's committees, with more clearly de ned competences, and obtaining a greater number of independent board members and a greater presence of women on the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors also decided to continue with all the procedures designed to meet within the shortest time possible the highest number of the Recommendations detailed in the Corporate Governance Report, some of which were only being partially met. Details of said levels of compliance can be found in the Annual Corporate Governance Report hosted on our website at www.acerinox.com.
Moreover, during 2017, all the Company's general policies were modi ed, and can now be found on our website.
The most relevant actions taken in 2017 are listed below:
1. Compliance with the Good Governance Code and Capital Companies Law From the outset, the Company made a great effort to comply with the greatest possible number of recommendations, following the entry into force of the new Uni ed Code of Good Governance, and for that reason it adopted a series of highly signi cant decisions. The rst one was to make a commitment to ensure that, by 2020, at least 30% of the members of the board would belong to the less represented gender. The company has proceeded as a consequence with the appointment this year of two new board members, thus achieving 4 independent board members, despite the resignation of a previous member.
Furthermore, in compliance with the Code of Good Governance and Capital Companies Law the Board appointed on 19 December 2017 the company KPMG to carry out for the rst time an evaluation of the Board of Directors by an external independent expert.
2. Appointments of Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Chief Risks Officer (CRO) At the last session held in 2017 the Board of Directors appointed a new Chief Prevention and Compliance Of cer. Furthermore, this year the Chief Executive Of cer appointed a new Chief Risks Of cer. The Chief Executive Of cer also appointed a Director of Strategy and a Director of the Digital Transformation Project.
72

3. Extension of the Code of Good Tax Practices In 2011 the Group joined the Code of Good Tax Practices approved by the Forum of Large Companies, which promoted a reciprocally cooperative relationship with the Tax Of ce. This year the Board of Directors agreed to adhere to the new Annex to the Code of Good Tax Practices. This implies the voluntary assumption of speci c commitments by the Group in order to improve the application of postulates and recommendations established within the Code, thus strengthening the good practice of business tax transparency. Acerinox is part of a Corporate Relations working group, and has had a signi cant role in drawing up the Annex. 4. New auditors The 2016 General Shareholders' Meeting, at the proposal of the Board of Directors, approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. as the auditor for 2017, 2018 and 2019, for the purpose of the review and legal audit of the nancial statements of Acerinox S.A. and its Consolidated Group. In the Audit Committee meeting held on 19 December 2017, the rm KPMG was appointed as auditor of the Acerinox Group Sustainability Report. This will be the rst year that a full audit is going to be made on the Sustainability Report, as last year there was a partial audit with a total of 16 indicators.

Ms. Martínez Alonso is appointed as External Independent Director."

5.2 The Board of Directors and its Committees
Main governing bodies: the Board of Directors and other executive bodies The Board of Directors The Board of Directors is the body responsible for directing, administering and representing the Company, without prejudice to the powers conferred on the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Board has three committees: the Executive Committee, the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee and the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors, on 31 December 2017, has 15 members, which is the maximum allowed by the Articles of Association. The Secretary does not qualify as a Member of the Board. Its composition meets the traditional principles of diversity and balance. The company only has one Executive Of cer - speci cally the Chief Executive Of cer - and has six proprietary directors and eight independent directors. All Board members have extensive professional experience in the business and academic worlds, and public administration. The Board re ects the diversity existing in the Group: four of its members are of foreign nationality and the members come from four different continents. In 2010, the company, in keeping with the best practices of Good Governance, decided to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and of the General Meeting from the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Of cer, the organisation's top executive.

Corporate Governance and compliance
Pursuant to the Capital Companies Law, the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 01 June 2017 approved the Remuneration Policy for Acerinox Directors for 2017, 2018 and 2019, with the favourable vote of 87.59% of the shareholders who attended the Meeting.
In line with this transparency policy, the Group made public that, in 2017, all the remunerations arising from the Board Members belonging to and attending the Board of Directors and its committees totalled 1,272,819.12 euros (excluding the amounts paid to the CEO as a salary for his managerial position). For more information on this subject, you may review the Annual Corporate Governance Report and the Report on the Remunerations received by Board Members (www.acerinox.com)
In total, the Board of Directors held nine meetings in 2017.
The Executive Committee The Board of Directors appointed an Executive Committee in 2008 to attend to the normal course of business and facilitate its regular monitoring. This body is presided over by the Chairman of the Board. The Chief Executive Of cer is a necessary member of the Executive Committee.
In order to facilitate transparency and communication among the governing bodies, the Company's rules empower the Chairman to propose to the full Board the rati cation or further deliberation of any matter discussed or decided on by the Executive Committee.
The increase to nine in the number of sessions of the Board of Directors, following the recommendations of good governance, meant a corresponding reduction in the number of meetings of the Executive Committee, which met four times in 2017.
For further information regarding its activities you can nd on the web page www.acerinox.com the section on the General Shareholders' Meeting 2018.
The Audit Committee As was the case in previous years, the Audit Committee was the most active body in 2017 in terms of the number of meetings held, a total of eight, which enabled it to develop its envisaged work plan by devoting itself to its core responsibilities, which are:
· Reporting on the annual, biannual and quarterly accounts. · Supervising internal audit services and the effectiveness of the company's internal monitoring and risk
management systems. · Supervising the process of preparing and presenting the regulated financial information. · Proposing to the Board of Directors the appointment of the accounts auditors, to be approved by the
General Shareholders' Meeting. · Preparation of the Report covering activities carried out during the period, which will be published
alongside the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Audit Committee will apply the principles, recommendations and criteria for good operations outlined in the new 3/2017 Technical Guide on audit committees in companies of public interest, which was approved by the CNMV on 27 June 2017.
76

The Audit Committee is chaired by an Independent Director, while the Secretary of the Board of Directors acts as its secretary. For further information regarding its activities you can nd on the web page www.acerinox.com the section on the General Shareholders' Meeting 2018. Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee It held three meetings in 2017. It continued with its initiative of previous years of proposing the maintenance of the remunerations of the Board Members, without any changes, to the Board of Directors, by means of the Board Member Remuneration Policy. It was also involved in setting the remunerations of the senior management. Furthermore, it reported to the Board of Directors on the re-election of the proprietary director Mr. Ryo Hattori, the ratification of Mr. Tomás Hevia, Ms. Rosa María García and Ms. Laura González, and proposed the appointment as independent director of Ms. Marta Martínez. This Committee coordinates, at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the assessment of the Board's performance. The Appointments, Remunerations and Corporate Governance Committee is chaired by an Independent Director, and the Secretary of the Board of Directors acts as its secretary.

6. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
NOTE 1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Name of the Parent company: Acerinox, S.A. (hereinafter the Company).
Incorporation: Acerinox, S.A. was incorporated with limited liability under Spanish law on 30 September 1970.
Registered of ce: Calle Santiago de Compostela, 100, Madrid, Spain.
Statutory purpose and principal activity: The Group's statutory purpose and principal activity, conducted through its subsidiaries, is the manufacture, transformation and marketing of stainless steel products. With a melt shop production capacity of 3.5 million tonnes, the Acerinox Group is one of the main stainless steel manufacturers in the world. It has six stainless steel factories: two manufacturing at products in Spain and South Africa; one producing at and long steel products in the United States; a further two making long steel products in Spain; and another in Malaysia that makes at steel products and currently has cold rolling production lines. The Group also has a network of sales subsidiaries in Spain and abroad that sell all its products as their main activity. Details of all the companies included in the Acerinox consolidated Group are provided in note 5, as well as the activities they carry out. The Parent Company's main activity is that of a holding company, as parent company of the Acerinox Group. The Company also renders legal, accounting and advisory services to all the Group companies and carries out nancing activities within the Group.
Financial year: the nancial year of Acerinox, S.A. and all the Group companies is a 12-month period. It starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December.
Annual accounts: these consolidated annual accounts were prepared by the Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A., on 27 February 2018.
NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 2.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated annual accounts of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter IFRS-EU) and other applicable provisions in the nancial reporting framework. The annual accounts for 2017 have been prepared using the same accounting principles (IFRS-EU) as for 2016, except for the standards and amendments adopted by the European Union which are obligatory as of 1 January 2017, and which have not had a signi cant impact on the Group. The most signi cant standards for the Group taking effect from 1 January 2017 are as follows:
· Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative. This amendment introduces requirements relating to the disclosure of financing activities in the statement of cash ows. The application of this standard became mandatory as of 1 January 2017. The Group has included a breakdown of transactions involving nancial liabilities to credit institutions in note 11.2.3.
· Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses. These amendments explain the requirements for recognising deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, detailing the accounting treatment of deferred tax when an asset is valued at fair value and this fair value is lower than the tax base of the asset. These unrealised losses give rise to deductible temporary differences regardless of whether the holder of the debt instrument expects to recover its carrying amount through its sale or use. The Group has assets available for sale, as detailed in note 11.2.5. At the year end, the fair value of those assets is above their cost, although in 2013 it was necessary to recognise an impairment in pro t and loss. This impairment was not tax deductible, so the Group recognised a deferred tax asset totalling 1.6 million euros. This asset was offset with a deferred tax liability derived from the fair value exceeding the equity cost.
105

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The following are standards or interpretations already adopted or pending adoption by the European Union that will be obligatory in the coming years and may have an impact on the Group:
· IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments. This standard supersedes the current IAS 39 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. In note 2.2 there is a detailed analysis of the assessment made by the Group on the possible impacts of applying this standard in the coming year. The new standard will also require a reconciliation between the initial and nal amount of the allowance for expected credit losses, and the assumptions and data.
· IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Pursuant to this standard, revenues are recognised when the customer obtains control of the good or service that has been sold, i.e. when they have the ability to direct the use of and obtain all of the bene ts of the good or service. IFRS 15 requires a breakdown of recognised revenues and revenues expected to be recognised in the future relating to existing contracts. Furthermore, the IASB has established certain amendments to this standard in order to clarify the guidelines for identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of intellectual property and including practical illustrative examples for each part of the standard. In note 2.2 there is a detailed analysis of the assessment made by the Group on the possible impacts of applying this standard.
· IFRS 16 - Leases. This new standard supersedes the current IAS 17. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This standard requires companies to recognise lease assets and liabilities in the statement of nancial position (except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). In note 2.2 there is a detailed analysis of the assessment made by the Group on the possible impacts of applying this standard.
· Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture: these amendments clarify the accounting treatment of sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint venture. The Group has no signi cant investments in associates or joint ventures.
· Amendments to IFRS 2 - Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions: this clarifies how to recognise certain types of share-based payment transactions. No impact on the Group as it does not carry out this type of transaction.
· Annual Improvements to IFRS for the 2014 -2016 cycle: IFRS 1, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 amended. No impact on the Group.
· Amendments to IAS 40 - Transfers of investment property: Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This amendment states that transferring a property to, or from, investment property requires a change in use of the property. Furthermore, it must be determined whether or not the property meets the de nition of an investment property. The Group has classi ed some of its industrial premises as investment properties, but in every case the change in classi cation has been due to a change in use, as they have ceased to be used for the Group's production activities and are intended for lease or sale.
· IFRIC Interpretation 22 - Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The international accounting standard IAS 21 on the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, states that the transaction date determines the exchange rate to apply for the initial recognition of the respective asset, expense or income. This interpretation establishes how to determine the transaction date when a consideration is paid or received in advance for transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The application of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Group, due to the insigni cant number of advance transactions of this kind.
· IFRIC Interpretation 23 - Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. It provides the requirements on how to re ect the effects of uncertainty in accounting for income tax. Not expected to have a signi cant impact on the Group.
· Amendment to IFRS 9 ­ Classification of certain pre-payable assets. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, although early application is permitted. This amendment proposes a narrow exception to IFRS 9 for particular nancial assets which, despite having contractual cash ows that are solely payments of principal and interest, do not meet this condition as a result of a prepayment feature. No impact on the Group as it does not hold this type of instrument.
· Annual Improvements to IFRS. 2015-2017 cycle: The amendments apply to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23 and will apply to the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, all subject to being adopted by the EU.
The Group has not applied any of these standards in advance.

2.2 Assessment of the impact of the new IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16
The Group will start applying these new international nancial reporting standards on the dates when their application becomes mandatory, i.e. 1 January 2018 for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and 1 January 2019 for IFRS 16.
The Group will apply these standards retrospectively, without restating the comparative gures. In any event, as described below, the changes are not expected to be signi cant:
· IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments.
The Group has assessed the main changes that implementing the standard may entail for the Group. Speci cally, the points that have required a more extensive analysis by the Group are detailed below:
o Changes in the classi cation of nancial assets: The standard maintains, but simpli es, the mixed measurement model and establishes three main measurement categories for nancial assets: amortised cost, fair value through pro t or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income. The basis for classi cation depends on the entity's business model and the characteristics of the nancial asset's contractual cash ows. Furthermore, investments in equity instruments are valued at fair value through pro t or loss, with the irrevocable option to present the changes in reasonable value in other comprehensive income, provided that the instrument is not held for trading. In the latter case, changes in the value of these equity instruments are recorded with a change in equity, not through pro t and loss, even in the event of impairment. The Group has assessed the classi cation and measurement of its nancial assets and does not believe that the application of the standard will have a signi cant impact. The Group's nancial assets consist of:
· Receivables, which the Group measures at amortised cost, in accordance with the policy detailed in note 2.11.2.b).
· Equity instruments, which the Group is not holding for trading and which, consequently, are currently in the available for sale category. As explained in note 11.2.5, the Group has classi ed in this category the holding of Acerinox, S.A. in the Japanese company Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited., which is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Group has measured this shareholding at its listed price and recognises the gain or loss in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense of comprehensive income, unless objective evidence exists that impairment has occurred, in which case the accumulated loss is taken from equity to the income statement. After applying the new IFRS 9, the Group is going to continue measuring these investments at fair value through other comprehensive income, with the only difference being that impairment losses will remain in equity items. The Group does not intend to dispose of these investments, but if it did so, the gains or losses on the sale would also be recognised in other comprehensive income, as stipulated in the new standard.
· Derivative financial instruments, which the Group either measures according to hedge accounting criteria or at fair value through profit or loss, as detailed below.
o IFRS 9 establishes that exchanges of debt instruments with substantially different terms will be recognised as an extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new nancial liability. The Group has assessed the debt renegotiations that it conducted in the years 2016 and 2017, to determine whether they could result in a difference in accounting treatment. However, all debt renegotiations were already recognised according to these criteria, so no adjustments are to be made as a result of applying the new IFRS.
o New impairment loss model based on expected credit losses and replacing the incurred impairment loss model of IAS 39. It is the Group's policy to hedge its commercial and political risks of all sales made in every country in the world, with the exception of those made in the United States. It hedges its credit risks either through credit insurance companies, or through letters of credit and bank guarantees extended by banks of recognised solvency. The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash ows. The Group considers risk hedging to be an integral part of the insured credit, so when calculating expected credit losses, it will not only take into account cash ows expected from the collection of receivables, but also those from the credit insurance. Furthermore, the Group also carries out non-recourse factoring transactions through which the risks and rewards of those assets are substantially transferred, thus leading to the derecognition of the credits from the balance sheet, allowing it to reduce the insolvency risk. Additionally, in some countries the maturity dates are within 30 days, allowing deliveries to be controlled and reducing any impairment losses. For these reasons, as explained in note 4.2, the history of losses from bad debt is very low, so no signi cant impact is expected due to this change in policy. The Group has de ned a new impairment loss model based on an historical analysis of the average bad debts in each of the subsidiaries and on the claims incurred in the credit insurance policies held, including any non-recoverable amount (maximum coverage of 85%-90% and excesses), and any amounts subsequently recovered after the claim, whether from the insurance company or the actual customers. The model indicates an estimated percentage of expected credit loss of 0.03% on all sales made in each
107

Consolidated Annual Accounts
year. In any event, these estimates are revised in our credit risk control system (commercial and nancial risk departments, risk committee and the corporate risk management department) that continuously monitors the speci c markets of each subsidiary, receives input from experts specialised in insurance companies and reviews the future estimates of renowned international bodies (IMF, OECD, etc.). When these parameters have been considered, the bad debt provision is calculated taking into account the likelihood of future loss, which is determined based on the composition of the trade receivables balance: whether it has coverage from insurance companies, letters of credit or there are duly approved guarantees, and the time delay over the established due date (a delayed debt of less than 30 days does not generate the same future default risk ratio as another with a delay of 120 days, etc.). During this year, the Group has entered a bad debt provision for the amount of 698 thousand euros, as detailed in note 11.2.1. The Group does not expect any signi cant change from applying an impairment loss model based on expected credit losses.
o Changes in the accounting of hedges: IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness. Under the current IAS 39, a hedge must be highly effective, both prospectively and retrospectively. IFRS 9 replaces this by requiring an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and for the hedge ratio to be the same as that used for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required, but is different to that which was prepared under IAS 39. The standard seeks to align hedge accounting more closely with risk management, with a target-based approach and seeking to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses in the current model. The Group only covers the risk of uctuations in the exchange rate of its currency positions with exchange rate insurance, and it also covers the risk of uctuation of interest rates with nancial swap instruments. Accounting of hedges is aligned with the risk management model. Hence, no changes are expected in the accounting of hedges. The Group currently uses hedge accounting for instruments that are designated to hedge interest rate risks and does not generally use it for instruments designated to hedge changes in exchange rates.
With regard to hedging changes in exchange rates, the Group generally recognises nancial instruments at fair value through pro t or loss, as some of these instruments are used to cover the Group's intercompany balances and it is dif cult to distinguish between the part of the instrument used to cover transactions with third parties and that used for the Group's companies. In any event, the Group only hedges cash ow risks for transactions made in foreign currencies that are recognised in the balance sheet, so any change to the derivative is recognised in pro t and loss, and is offset by any changes that occur at each reporting date in the monetary items recorded in foreign currencies, pursuant to IAS 21. Designating these instruments as hedging instruments would not lead to any accounting difference in the Group's income statement.
o IFRS 9 requires an entity to classify nancial assets based on its business model for managing those assets. The aim of the Group's business model is to obtain contractual cash ows and, in some cases, the sale of nancial assets. The Group derecognises sold nancial assets from its statements when the risks and rewards of these assets have been substantially transferred. The Group does not expect a signi cant impact from application of IFRS 9.
· IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers.
Applying this standard will not have a signi cant impact as the Group does not hold any closed contracts with customers that give rise to a right or obligation that is enforceable in advance. Furthermore, the Group is solely engaged in the manufacture and sale of stainless steel, so there are no service provision agreements.
The stainless steel is sold through sales orders, which do not give rise to any obligation until the delivery of the goods. Depending on the commercial terms of sale, the risk of the goods may be transferred when the materials are shipped from the Group's facilities or when they are delivered to the customer. The Group takes these terms of sale into account when determining revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Furthermore, in some cases, the amount billed may include an additional factor, namely transport. However, this cannot be considered a separate obligation as it is linked to the delivery of the goods.
The production process is planned on the basis of the customer backlog and, from the time of accepting the order, takes around 45 days in the case of cold-rolled products and 30 days in the case of slabs and hot-rolled products.
Therefore, the Group expects no impact from the application of this new standard.
108

· IFRS 16 - Leases. The Group will start applying this standard for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. During this year, the Group has assessed all assets leased from third parties and concluded that the Acerinox Group owns most of its productive assets except for land that the Group company Inoxcenter, S.L.U. has leased to the consortium in the free zone of Barcelona, on which the Group has an industrial building it owns. The lease has a term of ten years that is automatically renewed, and the cost of the rent is 120 thousand euros/year. In addition, the Group only has certain lease agreements for assets of little value (cars, forklifts and computer equipment). Furthermore, in the case of commercial subsidiaries that only employee 2-5 people, there are also some lease agreements for spaces in of ce buildings over which the Group has no control. The Group is considering applying the exemption that appears in the standard, which allows short-term leases or leases with a low-value underlying asset to be recognised on a straight-line basis throughout the term of the lease. Therefore, the Group expects no impact from the application of this new standard.
2.3 Basis of presentation of the consolidated annual accounts
The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared by the directors of the Parent Company to give a true and fair view of the Group's consolidated equity and consolidated nancial position at 31 December 2017 and 2016, as well as the consolidated results of its operations and changes in consolidated equity and consolidated cash ows for the years then ended. For the purpose of comparison with each of the items in the nancial statement, the annual accounts for 2017 also include the gures for the previous year. These consolidated annual accounts are presented in euros, rounded off to the nearest thousand. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities, which have been measured at fair value: derivative nancial instruments and available-forsale nancial assets. Inventories have been measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the individual accounting records of the Company and the subsidiaries forming the Acerinox Group. The consolidated annual accounts include certain adjustments and reclassi cations made to bring the accounting and presentation policies used by different Group companies into line with those of the Company. The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires the Parent Company's management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and, therefore, the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement. These estimates are based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate. The Group may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances. The aspects that involve a greater degree of judgement in the application of IFRS-EU, or for which the estimates made are signi cant for the preparation of the annual accounts, are detailed in note 3. Qualitative and quantitative details of the risks assumed by the Group which could have an effect on future years are provided in note 4. The consolidated annual accounts for 2016 were approved by the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting held on 1 June 2017. The Group's consolidated annual accounts for 2017 are currently pending approval by the shareholders. The directors of the Company believe that these consolidated annual accounts will be approved with no changes by the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting.
2.4 Going concern assumption and accruals basis
The consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Income and expenses are recognised on an accruals basis, irrespective of collections and payments.

2.5 Consolidation principles
a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company either directly or indirectly exercises control. The Company exercises control over a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Furthermore, the Company is understood to have power over a subsidiary when it has existing substantive voting rights that give it the ability to direct the nancial and operating activities and policies of the subsidiary. The nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual accounts from the date on which control commences to the date on which control ceases. The Group has considered potential voting rights in assessing its level of control over Group companies. The subsidiaries' accounting policies have been adapted to Group accounting policies. The Acerinox Group's consolidated subsidiaries that are included in the consolidated group as of 31 December 2017 and 2016 are listed in note 5. b) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the Group's pro t or loss and net assets attributable to non-controlling interests. Noncontrolling interests' share in the Group's net assets and consolidated comprehensive income for the year are disclosed separately in consolidated equity and in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired are recognised at the acquisition date at the proportional part of the fair value of the identi able net assets. Pro t and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a de cit balance. c) Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method for business combinations. No business combinations took place in 2017 or 2016. d) Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has signi cant in uence in nancial and operating decisions, but not control or joint control. The Group is generally understood to exercise signi cant control when it holds more than 20% of voting rights. The nancial statements of associates are included in the consolidated annual accounts using the equity method. The Group's share of the pro t or loss of an associate from the date of acquisition is recognised with a credit or debit to share in pro t/loss of equity-accounted investees in the consolidated income statement for the year. Losses of an associate attributable to the Group are limited to the value of its net investment, as the Group has not acquired any legal or constructive obligations. The Group has no signi cant investments in associates. e) Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Balances and transactions between Group companies and the resulting unrealised gains or losses with third parties are eliminated on preparing the consolidated annual accounts.
110

2.6 Translation differences
a) Functional and presentation currency The annual accounts of each Group company are expressed in the currency of the underlying economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The functional currency is the local currency for the majority of Group companies, with the exception of Bahru Stainless, NAS Canada and NAS Mexico, whose functional currency is the US dollar. The gures disclosed in the consolidated annual accounts are expressed in thousands of euros, the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.
b) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date, at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in pro t or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and recorded at historical cost are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date on which fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary items measured at fair value are recorded as a part of the gain or loss on the fair value of the item.
In the consolidated statement of cash ows, cash ows from foreign currency transactions have been translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates the cash ows occur.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation into the functional currency of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in pro t or loss.
c) Translation of foreign operations In preparing the Group's consolidated nancial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than the euro have been translated to euros at the closing rate prevailing at the reporting date; income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period; and exchange differences are recognised separately in equity and in the statement of comprehensive income under translation differences. Translation differences are taken to pro t and loss when the company that generates them ceases to form part of the Group.
The Group has applied the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, relating to accumulated translation differences. Consequently, translation differences recognised in the consolidated annual accounts generated prior to 1 January 2004 are recognised in retained earnings. Furthermore, the Group did not apply IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, retrospectively to goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS. Consequently, goodwill is considered as an asset of the acquirer, not the acquiree, and is therefore not subject to variations due to exchange rate uctuations affecting the acquiree.
For presentation of the consolidated statement of cash ows, cash ows, including the comparative balances of foreign subsidiaries, are translated into euros applying the same criteria as that used to translate the nancial statements.
No Group companies operate in hyperin ationary economies.
2.7 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the positive difference between the cost of acquisition and the Group's share of the fair value of the acquiree's identi able net assets (assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities) at the acquisition date.
The goodwill recognised in the consolidated nancial statements of the Acerinox Group mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless, Ltd. in 2002.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (or more frequently where there are indications of possible impairment) in accordance with IAS 36, if it has experienced
111

Consolidated Annual Accounts
impairment losses in its value. To this end, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) of the company that is expected to bene t from the synergies of the business combination. (See note 2.10). Impairment losses are recognised for a cash-generating unit when the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the Group's goodwill is allocated is determined based on its value in use. (See note 2.10)
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business combination is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement, after reassessing the measurement of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, as established in the standard.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset. b) Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scienti c or technical knowledge is expensed in the consolidated income statement when incurred.
When research ndings are applied to produce new products or to substantially improve existing products and processes, the associated development costs are capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the Group has suf cient resources to complete development and suf cient future cash ows are expected to be generated to recover the costs, with a credit to self-constructed non-current assets in the consolidated income statement. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
Expenditure on activities for which costs attributable to the research phase are not clearly distinguishable from costs associated with the development stage of intangible assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Capitalised development costs are not amortised while the project is underway. Upon successful completion of the project, amortisation begins on a systematic basis over the estimated useful life. In the event of changes in the circumstances that led to the capitalisation of the project expenditure, the unamortised balance is expensed in the year the changes arise. c) Computer software Computer software licences are capitalised at the cost of acquiring the licence and preparing the speci c program for use.
Computer software maintenance or development costs are charged as expenses when incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identi able and unique computer software packages by the Group are recognised as intangible assets provided that they are likely to generate economic bene ts that exceed the associated costs for more than one year. Capitalised expenses comprise direct labour costs and directly attributable overheads. d) Amortisation Intangible assets with nite useful lives are amortised by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they become available for use.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
- Industrial property: 5 years
- Computer software: 2-5 years
The Group does not have any intangible assets with inde nite useful lives.
Residual values, depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.
2.8 Property, plant and equipment
a) Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Items of property, plant and equipment that require a period of time in order to be ready for use are classi ed as under construction. An asset is understood to be ready for use when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. When in operation it is reclassi ed to the corresponding asset category, based on its nature.
112

The cost of self-constructed assets is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset, while also considering the criteria applicable to production costs of inventories. The production cost is capitalised by allocating the costs attributable to the asset to selfconstructed non-current assets in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowing costs directly linked to nancing the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost until the asset enters service. The Group also capitalises certain borrowing costs incurred on loans that are not directly designated to nance the investments, applying a capitalisation rate to the amounts used to nance these assets. This capitalisation rate is calculated based on the weighted average of the borrowing costs incurred on loans received by the Company other than those speci cally allocated to nance the assets. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised never exceeds the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes major repair costs, which are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated period remaining until the following major repair.
Subsequent to initial recognition of the asset and once it is ready for use, only improvement costs incurred which will generate probable future pro ts and for which the amount may reliably be measured are capitalised. Costs of periodic servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in pro t and loss as incurred.
Spare parts are carried as inventory unless the Group expects to use them over more than one period, in which case they qualify as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over their useful life. The carrying amount of a spare part is written off when it is used to replace a damaged part. Spare parts of property, plant and equipment are classi ed under technical installations and machinery in the breakdown provided in note 8.
Gains or losses on the sale or disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are recognised as operating income or expenses in the income statement.
b) Amortisation Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by allocating the depreciable amount of the asset on a straight-line basis over its useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost or deemed cost of an asset, less its residual value. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is signi cant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.
Residual values, depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.
Land is not depreciated, unless the Group has acquired the right to use the land and related property for a speci c number of years, in which case it is depreciated over the period of the right of use.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:
- Buildings: 10-50
- Technical installations and machinery: 3-30
- Other property, plant and equipment: 2-10
2.9 Investment property
Investment property comprises Group-owned buildings held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and subsequent sale but not occupied by the Group.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequently the Group applies the same criteria as for property, plant and equipment.
Although investment property represents only a minor proportion of the Group's total assets, investment property has been included separately in the balance sheet this year. It was previously included under property, plant and equipment. Separately, the Group has also included comparative gures.
Lease income is recognised using the criteria described in note 2.19 b).
113

Consolidated Annual Accounts
2.10 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group's non- nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
The recoverable amount of goodwill, which is not amortised, and of intangible assets not yet available for use is estimated at each reporting date, unless prior to this date there were indications of a possible loss in value, in which case these are tested for impairment.
Impairment losses are recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset, or its corresponding cash-generating unit, exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are expensed in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated cash ows, applying a discount rate that re ects the current market valuation of the time value of money and the speci c risks of the asset in question. For assets that do not generate cash in ows themselves, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, considered as the smallest identi able group of assets that generates cash in ows that are largely independent of the cash in ows from other assets or groups of assets.
Details of the variables and assumptions used by the Group to calculate value in use and identify cash-generating units are provided in notes 7.1 and 8.1. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed through the income statement provided that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. However, the new carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount (net of amortisation or depreciation) that the asset would have had if no impairment loss had been recorded.
2.11 Financial instruments
2.11.1 Classification The Company classi es nancial instruments into different categories based on the nature of the instruments and the Group's intentions on initial recognition. 2.11.2 Financial assets Acquisitions and disposals of investments are accounted for at the date on which the Group undertakes to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the investment expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. On derecognition of a nancial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction costs, is recognised in pro t or loss.
The measurement criteria applied to the nancial assets held by the Group in 2017 and 2016 are detailed below.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Derivative nancial instruments, except those that are designated as hedges and qualify for recognition as such, are included in this category.
The derivative nancial instruments included in this category are classi ed as current assets and measured at fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised as an expense in pro t and loss.
Changes in fair value are recorded under revaluation of nancial instruments at fair value in the income statement.
b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables include non-derivative nancial assets with receivables are for a xed or determinable amount and that are not traded in an active market. They are only classi ed as non-current when they are not due to mature within 12 months of the reporting date. These investments are initially recognised at the fair value that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, which is the same as the transaction price plus the costs directly attributable to the purchase, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group makes the necessary valuation adjustments where there is evidence that a receivable is impaired. The amount of the impairment
114

loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash ows, discounted at the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition. These losses are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement and are reversed with the recognition of the income in pro t and loss when their causes are eliminated.
Trade receivables are included in this category, recognised at their nominal value, which is the same as their fair value, as generally they do not have a contractual rate of interest, are expected to be received in the short term and the effect of not discounting future receipts is not material. In cases where the Group considers that amounts will not be collected when due, the provision for bad debts reduces the balance of trade receivables. The Group currently analyses trade receivables on an individual basis although in general all balances past due by more than 180 days or when the debtor has been declared insolvent are considered as impaired. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense in the income statement and are reversed when the factors leading to the allowance have ceased to exist. The reversal amount is credited to the income statement.
The Group has reviewed its policy on the basis of the new IFRS 9 applicable from 1 January 2018, as detailed in note 2.2.
Discounted notes and factored trade receivables are recognised until maturity under both trade receivables and current loans and borrowings, unless the risks and rewards associated with these assets have been substantially transferred, in which case they are derecognised.
c) Available-for-sale financial assets This category includes the Group's investments in the capital of other companies over which the Group has no control or signi cant in uence. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase. After initial recognition nancial assets classi ed in this category are measured at fair value provided this can be measured reliably, recognising the gain or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of listed securities is determined by reference to the share price. The fair value of nancial assets that are not quoted in of cial markets is calculated by reference to discounted future cash ows.
Equity investments included in this category whose market value cannot be reliably de ned are measured at acquisition cost, as permitted by IFRS-EU, less any impairment losses.
When available-for-sale nancial assets are sold, the cumulative gains or losses from changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale nancial asset has been recognised in comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is reclassi ed from equity to the income statement. This amount is calculated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any previously recognised impairment. Any impairment losses recognised in the income statement in relation to these assets are reversed against equity rather than through pro t and loss. Any subsequent increase in fair value is recognised under valuation adjustments in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
At the end of each reporting period the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment. Objective evidence of impairment exists when there is a signi cant or prolonged decline in the listed price of an investment below its cost. To determine whether this is the case, the Group examines the historical listed prices of its securities and how long they have been trading below cost.
In accordance with the new IFRS 9, which the Group will apply from 1 January 2018, accounting impairment in the value of investments classi ed in this category will remain in equity. At the same time, income from sales will not be reclassi ed to the income statement, but recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.11.3 Financial liabilities For measurement purposes, nancial liabilities are classi ed into the following categories:
a) Debts and payables Debts and payables include non-derivative nancial liabilities with xed or determinable payments. Debts and payables are initially recognised at cost, which is the same as their fair value, less any transaction costs incurred. These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between the amount received (net of transaction costs) and the amortised cost is recognised in pro t or loss. However, trade payables falling due in less than one year that have no contractual interest rate and are expected to be settled in the short term are measured at their nominal amount.
115

Consolidated Annual Accounts
This category also includes the bonds issued by the Group. The Group has contracted reverse factoring facilities with various nancial institutions to manage payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of nancial institutions are recognised under trade and other payables until they are settled or repaid or have expired. When debt is re nanced, the Group assesses whether the changes made in the new agreement are suf ciently important to recognise the effects as if it were a cancellation and, simultaneously, a new loan. b) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss This category includes the Group's derivative nancial instruments, except for nancial guarantee contracts or designated hedging instruments. These are recognised at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in pro t or loss. 2.11.4 Hedge accounting Derivative nancial instruments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, which coincides with their fair value. They are subsequently recognised at fair value. Derivative nancial instruments that do not meet hedge accounting requirements are classi ed and measured as nancial assets and nancial liabilities at fair value through pro t or loss. Where derivatives qualify for recognition as cash ow hedges, they are treated as such and the recognition of any resultant unrealised gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedged item. The effective part of the realised gain or loss on the derivative nancial instrument is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and later transferred to the income statement in the year or years in which the hedged transaction affects pro t or loss. The Group only undertakes cash ow hedges. At the inception of the hedge the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationships and the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedges. Hedge accounting is only applicable when the hedge is expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and until it expires. A hedge is considered as highly effective if it offsets the changes in cash ows attributable to the hedged risk throughout the period for which it was designated (prospective analysis) and the actual effectiveness, which can be reliably measured, is within a range of 80%-125% (retrospective analysis). The Group prospectively discontinues the accounting of fair value hedges when the hedging instrument expires, is sold or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. In these cases, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is recorded in pro t or loss. 2.11.5 Measurement of fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value are classi ed based on valuation inputs into the following levels:
LEVEL 1: includes nancial instruments for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices on active markets. LEVEL 2: includes nancial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on observable market inputs, other than quoted
prices. LEVEL 3: includes nancial instruments for which the fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs.
2.12 Inventories
Inventories are initially measured at cost of acquisition or production. Valuation allowances are made and recognised as an expense in the income statement when the cost of acquisition or production of inventories exceeds the net realisable value. The Group uses the same cost model for all inventories of the same nature and with a similar use. It uses the weighted average cost measurement method.
116

Finished goods and work in progress are measured at the weighted average cost of raw and other materials consumed, incorporating applicable direct and indirect labour costs and general manufacturing costs based on the higher of normal operating capacity or actual production.
Net realisable value is the expected selling price of these goods less costs to sell. In the case of work in progress the estimated costs of completion are also deducted from this price.
Raw materials are not written down below cost if the nished goods in which they will be used are expected to be sold at or above cost of production. The cost of underutilisation of operating capacity is not included in the value of nished goods and work in progress.
Any write-downs that reduce inventories to their net realisable value are reversed, up to the cost of the inventories, if the circumstances that gave rise to the write-downs cease to exist.
2.12.1 Emission allowances
Pursuant to Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December 2016, the Group recognises CO2 emission allowances as inventories. As International Financial Reporting Standards do not specify how to classify emission allowances, the Group opted to harmonise the two policies by adopting similar classi cation criteria in both the individual and consolidated accounts.
CO2 emission allowances are measured at cost of acquisition. Allowances acquired free of charge under the National Allocation Plan pursuant to Law 1/2007 of 9 March 2007 are initially measured at market value at the date received. At the same time, a grant is recognised for the same amount under deferred income.
Emission allowances remain classi ed as inventories until surrendered.
At year end, the Group assesses whether the carrying amount of the allowances exceeds their market value in order to determine whether there are indications of impairment. If there are indications, the Group determines whether these allowances will be used in the production process or earmarked for sale, in which case the necessary impairment losses would be recognised. These provisions are released when the factors leading to the valuation adjustment have ceased to exist.
A provision for liabilities and charges is recognised for expenses related to the emission of greenhouse gases. This provision is maintained until the company is required to settle the liability by surrendering the corresponding emission allowances. These expenses are accrued as greenhouse gases are emitted.
When an expense is recognised for allowances acquired free of charge, the corresponding deferred income is taken to operating income.
In the case of swaps of emission allowances, given that all of the Group's allowances were acquired free of charge, the accounting treatment applied by the Group is that of non-commercial swaps. The Group derecognises allowances surrendered at their carrying amount and recognises those received at their fair value when received. The difference between both values is recognised as deferred income.
Detailed information on emission allowances received and consumed in 2017 and 2016 is included in note 10.
2.13 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
In the consolidated statement of cash ows, the Group classi es interest paid and received as cash ows from operating activities, while dividends received are considered cash ows from investing activities and dividends paid are classi ed as cash ows used in nancing activities.
2.14 Grants
2.14.1 Capital grants Capital grants are those received by the Group for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. They are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet. They are initially recognised at the original amount awarded when there is reasonable assurance that this will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached. Subsequently, they are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets for which the grants were received.
117

Consolidated Annual Accounts
2.14.2 Operating grants Operating grants are those received to nance speci c expenses. They are recognised as income as the expenses are incurred. Grants relating to CO2 emission allowances that are free of charge, are taken to income in line with the recognition of the corresponding greenhouse gas emission expense.
2.15 Employee benefits
Certain Group companies have assumed the following long-term commitments with their employees: a) Defined contribution plans A de ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays xed contributions into a separate entity, and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold suf cient assets to pay all employee bene ts relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Certain Group companies pay contributions to pension and life insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee bene t expense when they are accrued. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Provisions are not made for de ned contribution plans as they do not generate future obligations for the Group. b) Defined benefit plans A de ned bene t plan is a commitment entered into by a company with its employees to remunerate services rendered. These bene ts have been established based on local legislation in certain countries, contracts signed to that effect, or as included in collective bargaining agreements prevailing in certain Group companies. Accrued commitments are calculated as the present value of the accumulated bene ts accrued by personnel until the reporting date, using actuarial assumptions. Calculations are made by independent experts. Group companies record the corresponding provisions to cover these commitments. Existing obligations may be classi ed as:
· Pension plans: certain Group companies have commitments with some employees reaching retirement age. · Early retirement bene ts: certain Group companies have undertaken to pay bene ts to employees who opt to take early retirement. · Supplements: these plans are obligations agreed with certain Group employees to supplement their remuneration on retirement. · Other post-employment commitments: certain Group companies provide healthcare bene ts to their retired employees. Entitlement
to these bene ts is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these bene ts are accrued over the period of employment. The Group complies with obligations regarding the externalisation of these commitments in countries where this is applicable. De ned bene t liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet re ect the present value of de ned bene t obligations at the reporting date, minus the fair value at that date of plan assets. The Group recognises changes in the actuarial value of obligations in other comprehensive income. An independent expert calculates the actuarial value of commitments. The measurement is performed using the Projected Unit Credit method, taking into account mortality tables and estimated future increases in medical costs. When plan assets include insurance policies that exactly match the amount and timing of some or all of the bene ts payable under the plan, the fair value of the insurance policies is considered equal to the present value of the related obligations.
118

2.16 Provisions
The Group recognises provisions when:
(i) It has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events;
(ii) It is more likely than not that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
(iii) A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account all risks and uncertainties surrounding the amount to be recognised as a provision and, where the time value of money is material, the nancial effect of discounting provided that the expenditure to be made each period can be reliably estimated.
2.17 Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current
The Group classi es assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as current and non-current. Assets and liabilities are considered current when the Group expects to realise or settle them within 12 months after the reporting date or they are cash or cash equivalents.
2.18 Income tax
The income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated tax payable on the consolidated taxable income or tax loss for the year using prevailing tax rates enacted at the reporting date and applicable this year. Current tax includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet method, based on temporary differences that arise between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated annual accounts. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates (and laws) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items previously charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax liabilities are always recognised. Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income or deferred tax liabilities will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer considered probable that suf cient future taxable income will be generated or there are no deferred tax liabilities against which the assets can be offset. Reductions are offset if there is renewed expectation that suf cient taxable income will be available against which the derecognised balance can be utilised.
The Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so, the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under non-current assets or liabilities, irrespective of the expected date of recovery or settlement.
Certain companies in the consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to taxation if they were distributed. The Group recognises any tax effect in this respect provided that it is not deemed likely that the reserves will have to be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The Parent Company has led consolidated tax returns since 1998. As agreed by the shareholders at an Annual General Meeting held on 28 May 2003, Acerinox, S.A. and some of the Spanish-domiciled subsidiaries form part of a consolidated tax group on an inde nite basis, with the exception of Metalinox Bilbao, S.A.U. and Inoxidables de Euskadi, S.A.U., which le tax returns separately. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the consolidated tax group comprised: Acerinox, S.A., Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A., Inox l, S.A., Inoxcenter, S.L.U., and Inoxcenter Canarias, S.A.U.
119

Consolidated Annual Accounts
2.19 Income
a) Sales of goods and rendering of services Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are signi cant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, or the possible return of goods. Revenue is recognised net of taxes, returns and discounts that the Group considers probable at the date the revenue is recognised, and after the elimination of intra-Group sales. b) Rental income Rental income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. c) Income from dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive it is established.
2.20 Environment
The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities. Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. However, where necessary, the Group recognises environmental allowances by applying the general criteria outlined in note 2.16. Property, plant and equipment acquired by the Group for long-term use to minimise the environmental impact of its activity and protect and improve the environment, including the reduction and elimination of pollution, are recognised as assets, applying the measurement, presentation and disclosure criteria described in note 2.8.
2.21 Changes in accounting estimates and policies, and correction of errors
The Group applies IAS 8 to recognise changes in accounting estimates and accounting policies and to correct errors. The Group recognises changes in accounting estimates in the period in which they occur. Accounting errors are corrected in the year in which they occurred, restating the comparative information presented in the nancial statements whenever these errors are material. Changes in accounting policies are applied retrospectively, adjusting the opening balances of the equity items affected as of the prior year for which gures are included.
120

NOTE 3 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts under IFRS-EU requires that the Company's management make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and, therefore, the amounts reported in the annual accounts.
Accounting estimates and judgements are assessed constantly and based on past experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered reasonable. The Company may amend these estimates in light of subsequent events or changes in circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and judgements related to future events. The resulting accounting estimates could differ from actual results. In accordance with IAS 8 on Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, changes in accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the Group's nancial statements.
The Group's main estimates are as follows:
a) Impairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 2.10.
The Group reviews property, plant and equipment at each reporting date to ascertain whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined based on their value in use. These calculations are made using reasonable assumptions based on past returns and future production and market development expectations. Some of these assumptions relate to sales, margins, discount rates and growth rates to perpetuity, which involve a high degree of judgement. Details of the analyses conducted by the Group in 2017 and 2016 are included in notes 7.1 and 8.1.
b) Useful lives of plant and equipment Group management determines the estimated useful lives and corresponding depreciation charges for its plant and equipment based on expert valuations. These could alter signi cantly as a result of technical innovations, variations in plant activity levels, etc. Management regularly reviews the depreciation charge and adjusts it when estimated useful lives are different from those previously applied, fully depreciating or derecognising technically obsolete and non-strategic assets which have been abandoned or sold.
During the year there has been a recalculation of useful lives in the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty), Ltd as explained in note 8.
c) Fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments The Group acquires derivative nancial instruments to hedge against changes in exchange rates and interest rates. The fair value of nancial instruments that are not traded in active markets is determined by using valuation techniques mainly based on market conditions existing at each reporting date, and provided that nancial information is available to carry out this valuation. In note 11.2.4 there is additional information on nancial instruments measured in accordance with these assumptions.
d) Provisions As mentioned in note 2.16, the provisions recognised in the consolidated balance sheet re ect the best estimate at the reporting date of the amount expected to be required to settle a liability, provided that the materialisation of this out ow of resources is considered probable. Changes in foreseen circumstances could affect these estimates, which would be revised if necessary.
e) Net realisable value As mentioned in note 2.12, the Group estimates the net realisable value of its inventories to recognise any impairment required. Expected selling prices of inventories less costs to sell are considered when calculating net realisable value.
121

Consolidated Annual Accounts
f) Recoverability of available tax loss carryforwards and deductions
The Group regularly evaluates its available tax credits through projections of pro t and loss approved by management, to conclude as to whether they will be recoverable in the future. The Group takes into account the limitations to offsetting tax loss carryforwards as stipulated in certain legislation. Details of the basis on which the Group assesses the recoverability of capitalised tax credits are provided in note 18.3.
Signi cant restrictions to the deductibility of prior years' tax losses were introduced in Spain in 2016, thereby prolonging their recovery periods (see note 18.1). Based on the estimates made, the Group considers that the tax credits recognised are still recoverable within a reasonable time frame.
g) Recognition of deferred tax liability for investments in subsidiaries. As indicated in note 2.18, some companies in the consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to taxation if they were distributed. The Group recognises any tax effect in this respect provided that it is not deemed likely that the reserves will be distributed in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group regularly evaluates the reserve repatriation needs of its subsidiaries. Based on the analysis made this year, which explained in note 18.3.1, the Group considers a repatriation of reserves by its subsidiaries in the amount of Euros 250 million. Hence, it has recognised the pertinent deferred tax liability.
h) Evaluation of the impact of tax reform in the United States On 22 December 2017, a tax reform was approved in the United States that is applicable for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has evaluated the impact of the measures introduced by the reform and recognised in this year the effect the rate reduction will have on deferred tax assets and liabilities. In note 18.1 a detailed explanation is given of the Group's analysis and of the potential impact of each of the measures introduced.
NOTE 4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group's activities are exposed to various nancial risks: market risk (currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group aims to minimise the potential adverse effect on its pro ts through the use of derivative nancial instruments, where appropriate to the risks, and by taking out insurance policies. In note 11.2.6 there is a detailed analysis of the Group's derivative nancial instruments at year end.
The Group does not acquire nancial instruments for speculative purposes.
4.1 Market risk
Market risk arises from variations in market prices due to exchange rate or interest rate uctuations or changes in the price of raw and other materials, which can affect a company's results and equity as well as the values of its assets and liabilities.
4.1.1 Currency risk The Group operates internationally and in various currencies, in particular the US dollar, and is therefore exposed to currency risk. Currency risk arises from commercial transactions, nancing and investment operations, and from the translation of nancial statements in functional currencies other than the Consolidated Group's presentation currency (euros).
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date, at the closing exchange rate prevailing at that date. Any exchange differences that may arise from translation are recognised in pro t or loss. To avoid uctuations in pro t and loss due to changes in exchange rates, and to ensure the expected cash ows, the Group uses derivative nancial instruments to hedge most of its nancial and commercial transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each country. To this end, at the beginning of each month and subject to fortnightly review, each company considers its loans in non-local currency, trade receivables and supplier balances in foreign currency, the sales and purchases in foreign currency forecast for the period and exchange rate insurance coverage. The Group may take commercial and
nance transactions as a whole into account when evaluating its total exposure for the purpose of hedging transactions in foreign currency. The Group hedges balances with third parties and between Group companies.
122

Using these instruments ensures that any uctuation in exchange rates that could affect assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency would be offset by a change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. Changes in the derivative are recorded in the income statement, offsetting any changes that occur in foreign currency monetary items.

The derivative nancial instruments used by the Group to hedge this risk are short-term sale or purchase contracts negotiated with the Group's Treasury Department in accordance with policies approved by management.

The Group also uses other derivatives such as cross-currency swaps to control currency risk in nancing operations.

Not all of the exchange rate insurance policies taken out by the Group meet the requirements to be considered cash ow hedging instruments and, therefore, to be recognised in accordance with the policy established in note 2.11.4. Policies that do not comply with these criteria have been accounted for as nancial instruments at fair value through pro t or loss.

In general, nancial instruments designated to hedge exposure to currency risk arising from commercial transactions are not recognised as hedging instruments. However, those designated as a hedge of foreign currency risk arising from nancing operations arranged with credit institutions qualify for recognition as hedging instruments.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their market price at the reporting date, which is the present value of the difference between the insured price and the forward price of each contract.

In note 11.2.6 there are details of the nancial instruments arranged by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2017 and 2016.

Lastly, the Group is exposed to currency risk as a result of the translation to euros of the individual nancial statements of companies whose functional currency differs from the Group's presentation currency, particularly the US dollar and the South African rand. The USD-euro exchange rate at 2016 year was 1.0541, while at 2017 year end it stood at 1.1943. The exchange rate of the South African rand to the euro at 2016 year end was 14.457, while at 2017 year end it was 14.8054.

Based on the exchange rates of these currencies against the euro at the end of 2017, sensitivity to changes in exchange rates, with other variables remaining constant, is as follows:

4.1.2 Interest rate risk
The Group's nancing comes from various countries and in different currencies (mainly the euro, the US dollar and the South African rand), with a range of maturity dates and mostly variable interest rates.
The Group's nancial liabilities and nancial assets are exposed to uctuations in interest rates. To manage this interest risk rate, curves are analysed regularly and on occasion derivatives may be used. These derivatives take the form of interest rate swaps and qualify for recognition as cash ow hedging instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account interest and exchange rates at that date and the credit risk associated with the swap counterparties.

123

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The Group took the opportunity, mainly in the second half of 2017, to extend the maturity of a substantial portion of its long-term loans by increasing the amounts and reducing the costs thereof This comes in addition to the re nancing of a large portion of the Group's loans that took place in the rst half of 2016, thereby extending the average life of its debt.
During the last year, the Group has increased the amount of nancing with a xed interest rate, mainly as a result of signing three long-term, xed-rate nancing contracts: a loan of 50 million euros with Banca March transferred to a securitisation fund upon signing, another 50 million
euros with BBVA and a nal loan of 120 million euros with Banco Popular. In turn, the number of interest rate hedges has been reduced, as no interest rate hedging instrument was arranged in 2017 and some existing hedges have matured during the year. In 2016, the syndicated loan that was signed in the United States in 2012 was settled by the group, thus cancelling the associated cross-currency swap. In note 11.2.6 there are details of the nancial instruments arranged by the Group to hedge this type of risk at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
Regarding the Group's interest rate sensitivity, had interest rates on the outstanding debt from nancing at year end been 100 basis points higher, with all other variables remaining constant, the Group's consolidated pro t after tax would have been 6.87 million euros lower due to a higher nance cost on variable-rate debt (6.07 million euros lower in 2016). The effect on the Group's equity of higher interest rates across the entire curve would have been a net decrease of 6.46 million euros (decrease of 4.97 million euros in 2016), as the higher borrowing costs would have been partially offset by increases in the values of its interest rate hedging derivatives held at the reporting date.
4.1.3 Price risk The Group is exposed to three types of price risk:
1. Risk due to changes in the listed price of securities held in listed companies.
The risk of price uctuations in listed securities relates to the shares held by the Group in Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited., which is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Group has not hedged this risk with derivative nancial instruments. There are details of the impact of the
uctuations in listed securities during the year in note 11.2.5 and it has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
2. Risk of changes in prices of raw materials
Stainless steel is an iron alloy with a minimum chromium content of 10.5%, which also contains other metals such as nickel or molybdenum to give it speci c properties. Given the variation in the price of the raw materials used in the production process, stainless steel prices can be highly volatile. The cost of raw materials, of which nickel accounts for approximately 40%, is approximately 70% of the total production cost. The price setting strategy is therefore one of the most critical functions and requires signi cant knowledge of the market. In Europe, South Africa and the United States, sale prices comprise a base price and a variable component known as the alloy surcharge. The alloy surcharge is calculated monthly by each of the market's stainless steel producers on the basis of a formula that takes into account the variation in the price of certain raw materials (particularly nickel, chromium and molybdenum) and uctuations in the EUR-USD exchange rate. The application of this alloy surcharge means that the change in nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange during production of the order, as well as
uctuations in the price of other raw materials and the EUR-USD exchange rate, can be passed on to customers. This natural hedge is applied to 90% of the Group's sales (Europe, America and South Africa).
The productive process is planned on the basis of the existing customer backlog. The Group's manufacturing period is 15 days, allowing it to link the cost of raw materials with the selling price to the customer through the alloy surcharge. Keeping strict control over inventories and adapting production to market circumstances help to alleviate the risk of raw material price uctuations.
The stainless steel market is characterised by healthy demand, which has grown at an annual rate of approximately 6% for over 50 years. Exceptionally, the market shrank by 11.8% in 2007-2009 because of the worldwide economic recession, but recovered with growth of 26.4% in 2010. The aforementioned annual growth rate is therefore expected to prevail in the medium term. Stainless steel is required for all industrial applications and used in all sectors, which guarantees that this growth will be sustained in the coming years. Although end consumption continues to grow steadily, the fact that this market is largely controlled by independent wholesalers leads to volatility in apparent consumption, re ecting their expectations regarding nickel price trends in the London Metal Exchange (LME) and their ensuing strategies to stockpile or realise inventories.
Fluctuations in the price of nickel also affect consumer demand. Reductions in the price of nickel tend to go hand in hand with short-term drops in demand. Conversely, a rise in nickel prices tends to go hand in hand with higher demand. To counter the risk derived from the fact that independent wholesalers control the majority of the market, the Acerinox Group has developed a sales network that enables it to supply
124

end customers on a continuous basis, by means of warehouses and service centres through which the Group's production is channelled. This policy has enabled the Group to achieve a signi cant market share among end customers and, therefore, stabilise sales and reduce this risk.
Maintaining suf cient inventory levels in warehouses entails the risk that these inventories might be recognised above their market price. The Group alleviates this risk by maintaining strict control over inventory levels.
The valuation of raw materials, work in progress and nished goods at average cost also helps to reduce the volatility of costs and, consequently, to decrease the impact of nickel price uctuations on margins.
The aforementioned factors (an own sales network, controlled inventory levels, alloy surcharges, average cost valuations, shortening of the production cycle and a policy of acceptance of short-term orders) help to reduce exposure to the main risk, namely the cyclical nature of apparent consumption due to the volatility of raw materials. As this is a factor beyond the Group's control, effective risk management is not always suf cient to eliminate its impact.
4.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is de ned as the possible loss that could be incurred through failure of a customer or debtor to meet contractual obligations.
The Group's exposure to credit risk is determined by the individual characteristics of each customer and, where applicable, by the risk corresponding to the country where the customer operates. Due to the diversity of its customers and the countries in which it operates, credit risk is not concentrated in any individual customer, sector or geographical region.
The Group hedges its commercial and political risks either through credit insurance companies, or through letters of credit and bank guarantees extended by banks of recognised solvency located in countries with low nancial risk. Credit insurance covers between 85% and 90% of declared commercial risks, depending on the country in which the customer is located and the insurance company, and 90% of political risks. The Group's main credit insurer has an A3 credit rating from Moody's and an "A excellent" rating from A.M. Best.
In 2017 payouts of 462 thousand euros have been collected under the credit insurance policy (1,672 thousand euros in 2016).
A risk committee is responsible for monitoring the Group's credit risk policy. New customers are analysed with and assigned a risk cover by the insurance company, which enables the Group to offer its general payment terms to those that ful l the necessary credit conditions. Where required, the risk committee also performs an individual analysis of customers' creditworthiness, establishing credit limits and payment terms. Payment in cash is required from those that do not.
The risk committee comprises representatives from the sales, nancial and legal departments. The risks of the companies that make up the Acerinox Group are analysed and information is in turn received from the respective risk committees of Bahru Stainless, Columbus, North American Stainless or Grupinox (which represents the sales network in Spain).
Among other duties, the risk committee reviews the status of past-due debts, monitors sales with excessive exposure, and approves internal loans or, depending on the amount, requests approval from the steering committee.
The Group has long-standing commercial relationships with many of its customers. In the event of a late payment, the Group monitors future deliveries and payment terms closely, reviews credit limits and improves existing measures as appropriate.
Where permitted under local legislation in the country in which the customer operates, retention of title clauses are used to secure recovery of goods in the event of default on payment.
On occasion the Group also uses other nancial instruments to reduce credit risk, such as factoring operations. The Group derecognises factored assets when the risks and rewards of these assets have been substantially transferred.
The Group makes valuation adjustments to trade receivables where necessary to mitigate the risk of bad debts, or provide for past-due balances, or when circumstances indicate that collection is doubtful. In general, the Group recognises impairment on receivables aged over 180 days or when the debtor has led for insolvency. Details of movement in impairment of trade receivables are provided in note 11.2.1. The Group has reassessed the model, to see if it meets the requirements established in the new IFRS 9, as detailed in note 2.2.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

At 31 December 2017, consolidated trade receivables amount to 552,058 thousand euros (527,788 thousand euros in 2016). Revenues for 2017 total 4,626,855 thousand euros (3,968,143 thousand euros in 2016). Credit risk insurance has been contracted for 55% of consolidated net sales (54% in 2016). Cash conditions exist for 2% (1% in 2016). Con rmed letters of credit or guarantees are used to hedge credit risk in 3% of consolidated net sales (2% in 2016). Domestic sales by North American Stainless Inc., which entail a very low risk due to the collection period of under 30 days, account for 37% of consolidated net sales (37% in 2016), allowing deliveries to be controlled and reducing any impairment losses.

The ageing analysis of receivables is as follows:

(Expressed in thousands of euros)
Outstanding Less than 30 days 30-60 days 60-90 days Over 90 days TOTAL

% of payables 86% 11% 1% 0% 2%
100%

The Group has made provisions for 4,831 thousand euros (7,260 thousand euros in 2016). Provision was made for an amount of 698 thousand euros during the year (522 thousand euros in 2016), accounting for 0.02% of sales in 2016 and 2017.

Most of the Group's past-due receivables are insured and generally re ect customary delays in trading activity (85% of past-due receivables are aged less than 30 days). At 17 February, over 85% of the above past-due debt has been collected (84% in 2016).
In view of the default rates in all sectors, we consider that the above gures are highly satisfactory and vindicate the Group's credit risk policy.
Any advances to suppliers of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets are hedged through bank guarantees issued by the supplier and con rmed by banks of recognised solvency.
With regard to the credit risk of bank balance sheets, only banks and nancial institutions that are rated by an independent third party and with a `Ba1' credit rating from Moody's are accepted. The Group has no signi cant concentration of risks as the likelihood of a default by the banks and
nancial institutions that are thus authorised is remote, based on their high credit ratings.

4.3 Liquidity risk
The Group is primarily nanced through the cash ows generated in its operations, in addition to loans and nancing facilities.
Although access to liquidity has improved considerably over the last two years, the Group ensures its liquidity and exibility through long-term loans and nancing facilities for amounts exceeding the quantities required at any time.
The Group's cash is centrally managed to optimise resources. The Group's net debt is primarily concentrated within the Parent Company (more than 92% of total gross borrowings at year end).
Based on its cash ow estimates and considering its investment plans, the Group has suf cient funding to meet its commitments, and maintains suf cient balances available for drawdown from credit facilities to cover liquidity risk. In 2017 and 2016 no payment defaults occurred on the principal of loans or loan interest on the Group's nancing.
At year end the Group has been granted current and non-current nancing totalling 1,964 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. 1,230 million euros has been drawn down from nancing facilities at 31 December 2017 and 150 million euros from factoring facilities. In 2016, the Group had current and non-current nancing facilities of 1,819 million euros and non-recourse factoring facilities of 420 million euros. Drawdowns from nancing facilities amounted to 1,218 million euros and drawdowns from factoring facilities amounted to 135 million euros. At 31 December 2017 cash and cash equivalents amount to 621 million euros (598 million euros in 2016).

126

The high levels of bank borrowings to guarantee mid-term liquidity along with the ongoing effort to reduce working capital continues to lead to high levels of cash in the Group. The cash balances are available and there is no restriction on their use.
Cash deposits are always short-term ­ never exceeding three months ­ and with banks of recognised solvency.
In addition, the Group continually monitors the maturity of its nancial debt, seeking to establish the longest possible maturities.
The most signi cant nancing operations during 2017, due to their aggregate amount, were the renegotiation of much of the existing debt and the arrangement of new loans, for the purpose of debt rescheduling and to reduce costs. The total volume of these operations was 725 million euros, and they include operations relating to existing and new loans. The existing loans include those with Banco de Sabadell, Banco Santander, Bankia, Banco Popular and Bankinter. In terms of new loans, loan agreements were signed with Banca March, Banco Social de Crédito Cooperativo, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and the European Investment Bank. The aggregate amount of these latter four loans totals 210 million euros. Details of these nancing operations are provided in note 11.2.3.
During 2016 there was also the debt rescheduling of the majority of the bilateral loans held by Acerinox S.A., which was undertaken to extend the repayment due dates to between four and ve years and to reduce the margins.

Consolidated Annual Accounts
Payables to public entities are not included in suppliers and other payables.
The item "other current nancial liabilities" mainly relates to deposits and guarantees in the amount of 2,659 thousand euros, whose maturity is indeterminate.
Future cash ow maturities include the loan principal plus interest based on contractual interest rates at year end.
This item does not include approved investments not capitalised under property, plant and equipment under construction at the reporting date.
4.4 Brexit
Regarding the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Acerinox Group does not believe that this will have any impact on its nancial statements, as the Group only has one distribution subsidiary there and it has no productive assets in that country. The subsidiary imports the material that is manufactured in any of the Group's manufacturing plants and sells it in the country. The total amount of xed assets that the Group has in that country is 4.5 million euros (with the Group's total xed assets being 2,148 million euros). Furthermore, the sales made in that country only represent 2.6% of the Group's total sales. Any ight of customers that may occur as a result of Brexit should not lead to a decrease in the Group's sales, as they can be offset in any other country, given that it is a global market.
4.5 Capital management
The aims of the capital management policy are:
- To safeguard the Company's capacity for sustained growth
- To provide appropriate returns to shareholders
- To maintain an optimum capital structure
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on changes in economic circumstances. To maintain and adjust its capital structure, it can adopt different policies relating to the payment of dividends, the reimbursement of the share premium, share buybacks, self- nancing of investments, non-current borrowings, etc.
Capital structure is controlled using different ratios, such as the net nancial debt/EBITDA ratio, understood to be the period necessary for the resources generated by the Company to cover the level of debt; or the gearing ratio, i.e. the relationship between net nancial debt and equity of the Company.
Net nancial debt is taken to be the sum of current and non-current loans and borrowings, plus notes issued, less cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA re ects operating pro t or loss before amortisation, depreciation and changes in trade provisions (which comprise a decrease of 1.203 thousand euros).
The ratio of net nancial debt to EBITDA is 1.25x, lower than in 2016 (1.88x) and the best gure achieved since 2004.
The Group is well within the limits stipulated in the covenants governing Group borrowings, as detailed in note 11.2.3.
After taking into account investments of 184.6 million euros made in 2017 (157.3 million euros in 2016) (which are detailed in the statement of cash ows as cash ows from investing activities), the Group generated cash ows of 181.3 million euros (111.5 million euros in 2016) due to the signi cantly greater pre-tax pro t of 298.6 million euros (127.9 million euros in 2016) and optimal management of working capital which, despite the increased activity recorded in the year, fell by 0.6 million euros (decrease of 16.3 million euros in 2016). Net nancial debt, which amounts to 609.2 million euros, is down by 1.7% with respect to the prior year (619.9 million euros).
The Group's gearing ratio is 30.9%, the second lowest achieved in the last 15 years after that obtained in 2016, which was 28.6%.
As remarked in note 11.2.3., the most signi cant nancing transaction in 2017 was the restructuring and extension in June of the Borrowing Base Facility of Columbus Stainless Pty Ltd. for ZAR 3,500 million. The transaction, which was originally signed in April 2015, was extended for another two and a half years, including modi cations in its structure to give Columbus greater exibility. The lead arranger of the transaction continues to be Deutsche Bank AG, Amsterdam Branch.
128

In addition, in June 2017, another non-extinctive amendment was made to the syndicated factoring agreement of 370 million euros, extending the termination date of the contract to June 2019. The lead arranger of the transaction continues to be Santander Factoring y Con rming S.A. E.F.C. The volume of investments continues to be in line with the Group's strategic plan. The Group did not base its 2008-2020 strategic plan, which has been revised for the 2016-2020 period, on opportunistic criteria, but rather on industrial rationale and long-term ef ciency, meaning that, its nancial position permitting, the Group can keep to this plan even when the economic climate is unfavourable. After the 2013-2016 period when Acerinox offered its shareholders a scrip dividend option at their Annual General Meeting held on 1 June 2017, it agreed to make a single cash payment of 0.45 euros per share, which was paid to the shareholders on 5 July 2017. This remuneration is the same amount that has been paid since 2006, whether as a cash dividend or scrip dividend. The share capital of Acerinox, S.A. remains at 276,067,543 shares.
4.6 Insurance
As the Group's three integrated at product production plants, one cold rolling plant and three long product production plants are located in different regions, an accident would not affect more than one-third of total production. This guarantees the continuity of the business, while adequate co-ordination between the remaining factories reduces the consequences of material damage to any of the facilities. Suf cient coverage has been contracted for the Group's factories through material damage and loss-of-pro t insurance policies, which account for over 56.72% of the Acerinox Group's insurance expenditure. All assets under construction are covered by both the insurance policies taken out by the respective suppliers in addition to a global building and assembly policy. The Group also has a reinsurance company based in Luxembourg, Inox Re, which manages these risks by assuming a part as self-insurance and accessing the reinsurance market directly. The Acerinox Group has also arranged general liability, environmental, credit, transport, and group life and accident insurance policies to reduce its exposure to these different risks.

In 2017 the only signi cant change to the consolidated group was the liquidation of the Group company Acerinox Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. This company had been inactive since 2013, when the Board of Directors of Acerinox, S.A. decided to restructure the Group's sales network in Southeast Asia by merging the following trading companies in Malaysia: Acerinox S.C. Malaysia and Acerinox Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. As a result, Acerinox, S.A. sold Acerinox S.C Malaysia its interest in Acerinox Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. and at the same time, Acerinox S.C Malaysia assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Acerinox Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. Malaysian law has required the Company to be kept inactive during this period, up until its nal liquidation. The impact of this liquidation on consolidated pro ts has been revenue of 593 thousand euros from cumulative translation differences in this company, taken to pro t and loss. The pro t from the liquidation was recognised under nance income in the consolidated income statement.
Furthermore, Acerinox, S.A acquired a 5% interest in the Group company Acerinox Russia, L.L.C from the subsidiary company Acerinox Scandinavia, A.B., for 3 thousand euros. With this transaction, the Company from the Group in Russia is now wholly owned by the Parent Company Acerinox, S.A.
In 2016 the only signi cant change was the liquidation of the Group company Acerinox Norway AS. The company was wholly owned by Acerinox, S.A. and acted as a commission agent for the Group company Acerinox Scandinavia AB, registered in Sweden, for sales in Norway. Acerinox Scandinavia absorbed the personnel of the entity. This operation had a positive 597 thousand euros impact on the Parent Company's results, which was derived from the repatriation of share capital and accumulated reserves. Conversely, this operation had a negative impact

133

Consolidated Annual Accounts
of 290 thousand euros on consolidated pro t due to cumulative exchange differences and this company's results until the liquidation date. The loss on the liquidation was recognised under nance costs in the consolidated income statement.
During 2016, a further 50 shares of the Group company Roldan, S.A. were also acquired from non-controlling shareholders, thereby raising the ownership interest held by Acerinox, S.A. to 99.77%. These shares were purchased for 1 thousand euros.
5.3 Capital increases and reductions
There have been no capital increases or reductions in any of the Group's companies during the year.
In 2016 the Group company Acerinox Shanghai reduced its capital by 46,418 thousand yuan, which is equivalent to 6.2 million euros. The company is wholly owned by Acerinox, S.A. Its share capital at year end amounts to 19,331 thousand yuan.
The Group company Inoxplate Lda, a wholly owned investee of the Group company Acerol Ltda (both of which are located in Portugal), reimbursed the supplementary contributions of 900 thousand euros received from its parent company.
5.4 Impairment of investments
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Parent Company has analysed the recoverability of its investments in Group companies with indications of impairment to determine whether their carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. Following the analyses carried out in both years, the Parent Company has only recognised impairment on its investment in Acerinox SC Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
During the year, the Parent Company has recognised impairment of 7,288 thousand euros on its investment in the company Acerinox SC Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., because its recoverable amount, calculated on the basis of discounted expected cash ows, is less than its carrying amount (impairment of 10,792 thousand euros in 2016). At 31 December 2017, this investment has been recorded in the individual annual accounts of Acerinox, S.A. at 19,475 thousand euros, which is equal to its recoverable amount.
During 2016, the Parent Company also reversed 2,205 thousand euros of portfolio impairment recognised in prior years on the investment in Acerinox Paci c, Ltd. This company's streamlined structure, attributable to its sole role as commission agent, and the waiving of the loan in the previous year, has improved its prospects, thereby increasing its expected recoverable amount. The carrying amount of Acerinox, S.A.'s investment in this company is 7,467 thousand euros.
Details of the carrying amounts of investments in Group companies are included in note 5.1.
This impairment does not have an impact on consolidated results as these companies are fully consolidated. There is a detailed analysis of the analyses performed in the Parent Company's individual report.
NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING
As described below, the Group is organised internally into operating segments, which are strategic business units. The strategic business units have different products and services and are managed separately. Group management reviews internal reports for each unit at least monthly. The operating segments presented by the Group, associated with the types of products it sells, are as follows:
· Flat stainless steel products: slabs, flats, coils, plates, sheets, circles and flat bars. · Long stainless steel products: bars, angles, wires and wire rods. · Other: other stainless steel products not included in the previous segments. The "unallocated" segment re ects the activities of the holding company and activities that cannot be allocated to speci c operating segments. Segment results, assets and liabilities include all items directly or indirectly attributable to a segment. No signi cant assets are shared between segments and, considering the importance of at stainless steel products, any assets that could be attributed to both segments are assigned to the at segment. Inter-segment sales prices are established in accordance with market commercial terms and conditions governing non-related third parties.
134

A segment's performance is measured by its net pre-tax pro t. The Group considers this information to be the most relevant in evaluating a segment against other comparable segments in the sector.

The research and development expenses incurred by the Group do not meet the criteria for capitalisation and are therefore recognised as expenses, by type, when they are incurred. Research and development and innovation (R&D&I) costs directly recognised as expenses for the year and taken to the income statement amount to 13,597 thousand euros (15,642 thousand euros in 2016).
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the Group has not entered into any contracts to acquire intangible assets.

7.1 Goodwill impairment testing
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill on an annual basis, or more frequently where there are indications of possible impairment. To this end, goodwill is allocated to the company's cash generating units that are expected to bene t from the synergies of a business combination.
At 31 December 2017, goodwill totals 69 million euros and mainly relates to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Columbus Stainless, Ltd. in 2002. This goodwill has been allocated to the Columbus cash-generating unit (CGU), which manufactures and sells at products only.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on its value in use. These calculations are based on cash ow projections from the nancial budgets approved by management over a period of ve years. Cash ows beyond this ve-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates indicated below. The growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
Forecast volumes of sales and production are based on the current capacities of existing machinery and equipment. Management determined budgeted gross margins based on past experience and forecast market performance. The weighted average growth rates are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used are pre-tax values and re ect speci c risks related to the relevant segments. Other signi cant assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values.
In 2017 Columbus Stainless, Ltd signi cantly improved its pre-tax pro ts, achieving ZAR 624.95 million, compared with ZAR 567.33 million in 2016. These gures represent an additional increase in its pre-tax pro ts (+10.2%) this year, continuing the positive trend that began in 2013. It is also continuing to beat the presented forecasts. In 2017 its gures were an 8.5% improvement on the estimates; in 2016 there was a 58.2% improvement.
The Company is con dent that the ows to perpetuity will materialise, mainly in terms of its use of production capacity and margins, while still applying prudent criteria to the growth rates (g) used. The growth rates have been calculated using estimated growth rates for the country and sector, and bearing in mind historical growth in the consumption of stainless steel.
The key assumptions used to calculate value in use are as follows:

2017

2016

Budgeted EBIT margin (*)

5.8%

5.1%

Weighted average growth rate (**)

2.5%

2.5%

Discount rate applied (***)

12.5%

12.6%

(*) EBIT margin, considered equivalent to operating pro t/loss (as a percentage of net revenue). Average value of the budgeted period. (**) Used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the budgeted period. (***) Discount rate applied.

The discount rate applied (weighted average cost of capital or WACC) is 12.5%. It is calculated taking as reference the interest rates on South African sovereign debt (ten-year swap on the South African rand), a market risk premium of 5.4% and the capital structure of similar companies.

When calculating the terminal value, repayments are considered equal to investments and the change in working capital is calculated as the value of the last projected year, 2022, which is understood to be consistent in the long term, increased by the growth rate (g).

139

Consolidated Annual Accounts
The growth rate (g) remains constant at 2.5%. In 2017 the global stainless steel market continued to consolidate the historical market growth rate of 5.9% for the 1950-2017 period. According to our estimates, apparent consumption of at stainless steel products in the South African market has fallen by 6.4% in 2017 compared with the gures recorded in 2016 (-8.5%), due to the problems with the national economy and political instability, although in recent months there has been an improvement in industries such as mining, which may lead to an increase in stainless steel consumption. The country's GDP has experienced a signi cant decline since 2011 and last year did not see a reverse in the trend of recent years. Consequently, Columbus had to increase its exports, mainly to Europe, where prices were higher throughout the year. It also increased the volume of hotrolled coils supplied to Bahru Stainless, Sdn Bhd, the Group's factory in Malaysia. The aforementioned decline in local sales was more than offset by the rise in exports, resulting in an overall increase in turnover of 16% (+15.3% in 2016). Melt shop production also increased, by 1.5% during this year (13.1% in 2016). 2017 was a good year for Columbus Stainless, Ltd, but not without signi cant challenges. In addition to the aforementioned weakness in the local economy, these included the increase in energy costs and the revaluation of the local currency, the rand, which made it less competitive in international markets. This situation was partially mitigated by the inherent advantages of the Columbus factory: its proximity to ferrochrome production facilities and the possibility of performing direct liquid loading of this mineral, leading to signi cant savings and reduced stocks of raw materials. Against the above backdrop, Columbus has become established as one of the Group's pro t centres, thus demonstrating the effects of the successive excellence plans and the success of the strategy followed. In conclusion, besides adequate management of the situation in the country, the increase in sales in strategic markets, the supply of semiproducts to Bahru Stainless and increased penetration in the Middle and Far East and Latin America have all contributed to this positive trend, and in the future it should increase its sales in the large emerging markets in Africa: Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya. The Company's budgets re ect these factors, as well as a gradual increase in sales to Bahru Stainless, Sdn Bhd as the Malaysian factory achieves higher utilisation of its present installed production capacity. Other assumptions are the euro-rand exchange rate (14.805) and the price of raw materials (11,200 USD/MT), which are established when drawing up the budget. Both assumptions are extrapolated applying very conservative criteria and are held constant over the period analysed. The variables used in 2016 were a euro-rand exchange rate of 14.457 and a raw materials price of 10,500 USD/MT. The impairment test performed at 31 December 2017 shows that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by 112 million euros (59 million euros in 2016). The discount rate (WACC), the growth rate (g) and the budgeted EBIT margin are considered key assumptions in the impairment test. Following a sensitivity analysis entailing different scenarios, impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 34.5% (18% in 2016). In the case of the growth rate (g), even with a growth rate of 0%, the discount rate (WACC) would have to increase by 27% (9.6% in 2016) for the carrying amount to show impairment. The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 30% (18.3% in 2016) to 4.0% (4.1% in 2016), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.

Investments
Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the year amounted to 173,332 thousand euros. These include 111,109 thousand euros invested by the Spanish Group company Acerinox Europa mainly in a new cold-rolling mill and a fth annealing and pickling line. This year, the company North American Stainless invested a total of 44,297 thousand euros to complete the cold-rolling mill and the bright annealing (BA) line. Investments in 2016 amounted to 172,877 thousand euros, including 106,738 thousand euros invested by the company North American Stainless and 39,377 thousand euros by Acerinox Europa.

Work on the new lines of North American Stainless is complete and they were commissioned at the end of the year. With regard to Acerinox Europa's investments, the Company expects them to be completed over the course of 2018.

During the period, on completion of the start-up period, the aforementioned investments made by the company North American Stainless were reclassi ed from work in progress to nished goods. The amount reclassi ed in this company is 131 million euros. The start-up of these investments increased depreciation for the year by approximately 6 million euros per year.

Of the total amount recognised under this caption, 115 million euros correspond to the aforementioned investments made by Acerinox Europa, whose lines are expected to be commissioned during 2018. During 2016 it included 114 million euros for investments made by North American Stainless and 38 million euros corresponding to investments by Acerinox Europa.

In 2016, on completion of the start-up period, phase II investments made by the Group company Bahru Stainless, Sdn Bhd were reclassi ed from work in progress to nished goods. The amount reclassi ed in this company totalled 292 million euros. The start-up of these investments increased depreciation for the year by approximately 1 million euros per month.

Changes in accounting estimates
As explained in note 3, the Group periodically reviews estimated useful lives based on the valuations made by experts. As a result of these analyses, the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty), Ltd. changes the useful lives of some of its assets. The technological improvements and maintenance plans implemented by the company have led us to forecast a lengthening of useful lives of between 5 and 10 years. The Group has accounted for the change in accounting estimates prospectively, from 1 January 2017, as stipulated in IAS 8. The impact of the change in accounting estimates on pro t and loss at 31 December 2017 was 2,265 thousand euros, due to the reduction in provisions for this year.

Estimated useful lives remained unchanged in 2016.

142

Guarantees At 31 December 2016 and 2017 none of the Group's assets has been pledged to secure loans and borrowings.
Commitments At 31 December 2017 the Group had signed contracts to purchase new equipment and facilities amounting to 68,933 thousand euros, of which 56,054 thousand euros was for new investments made by Acerinox Europa for the completion of its investments in the new cold-rolling mill and the fth annealing and pickling line. At 31 December 2016 the Group had entered into contracts to purchase new equipment and facilities amounting to 127,034 thousand euros, of which 26,686 thousand euros was for new investments by North American Stainless, 92,412 thousand euros for Acerinox Europa and 4,783 thousand euros for investments in the new Malaysian plant.
Capitalised borrowing costs Borrowing costs of only 48 thousand euros have been capitalised in 2017 for the company Columbus Stainless (2,317 thousand euros in 2016, mostly corresponding to the Group company Bahru Stainless). The capitalisation rate in 2017 was 9.5% due to the high nancing interest rates in rand (4.23% in 2016). This reduction in the amount of capitalisation is mostly due to the investments made in the companies North American Stainless and Acerinox Europa using cash generated in operating activities, making it unnecessary to use nancing.
Disposals of fixed assets The loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment or the removal of assets from service totals 1,917 thousand euros and is recognised under other operating expenses in the 2017 income statement (516 thousand euros in 2016). This balance primarily re ects the disposals of obsolete parts that were in the Group's warehouses.
A pro t of 2,218 thousand euros on the sale of property, plant and equipment or the removal of assets from service has been recorded under other operating income in the 2017 income statement (3,239 thousand euros in 2016). These correspond to the sale of land and a warehouse of the Group in Malaysia, and an industrial bay in Spain, classi ed as investment property.
Spare parts used in maintenance work have been recognised as removals from property, plant and equipment in the net carrying amount of 5,660 thousand euros.
Environment Property, plant and equipment held to minimise the environmental impact of the Group's activities and to protect and improve the environment at 31 December 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

In 2017, the Group received an environmental grant of 186 thousand euros to offset the costs of indirect greenhouse gas emissions. During 2016 the Group received energy saving grants totalling 406 thousand euros.
In 2017 the Group incurred environment-related ordinary expenses of 113,442 thousand euros (105,611 thousand euros in 2016).
This year, the Company recognised a provision for environmental activities for the amount of 45 thousand euros, for the rehabilitation of land owned by the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty) Ltd. The land is an area which is currently not used for the Group's production activities. At 31 December 2016 there were no signi cant contingencies relating to the protection and improvement of the environment.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Property, plant and equipment not used in ordinary activities Group property, plant and equipment not used in ordinary activities include several industrial bays, which are classi ed as investment property. Details and the valuation of this property are provided in note 9.
Other information At 31 December 2017 and 2016 there are no litigation cases, seizures or similar measures that may affect items of property, plant or equipment.
The Group's companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their property, plant and equipment. The coverage of these policies is considered suf cient.

8.1 Impairment of assets
As established in IAS 36, and as mentioned in the accounting policies, (note 2.10), the Group assesses whether there are any indications of impairment of the assets at each year end. The value of an asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The Group considers sources of information that are both external (technology changes ,signi cant uctuations in market interest rates, assets' market value, etc.) and internal (evidence of obsolescence, continued losses in the entity, substantial deviation from estimations, etc.) in determining the existence of impairment. During the year, there were only signs of impairment in the company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. Nevertheless, the analysis also includes Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. because, although it earned pro ts during the year, they were due mainly to the extraordinary proceeds from the sale of a property.

As detailed below, the results of this analysis do not indicate a need to make any valuation adjustments to the assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represent 44% of the Group's assets. A breakdown by company shows that 94% of the Group's property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are located in the factories, with the remaining 6% held by its 33 other subsidiaries:

Subsidiares ACERINOX EUROPA S.A.U. ROLDAN, S.A. INOXFIL, S.A. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS INC. COLUMBUS STAINLESS PTY Ltd BAHRU STAINLESS Rest of subsidiaries TOTAL

%Property, plant and equipment 14,06% 0,96% 0,18% 38,73% 7,12% 32,69% 6,26%
100,00%

The majority of assets do not generate cash in ows independently, as the whole production process needs to be completed. Impairment has therefore not been estimated on an individual basis, but by allocating the assets to cash-generating units. In the case of plants, the smallest cashgenerating units that can be deemed to encompass each plant as a whole.

The recoverable amount of the items has been determined based on their value in use.

Value in use of the assets was determined based on the estimated future cash ows the entity expects to obtain from the asset and the discount rate, understood to be the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The following points were taken into consideration when calculating the discount rate:

1. The nancing structure or gearing is considered based on market participant assumptions. 2. The cost of debt is obtained using the applicable market risk-free rate plus a spread of 2%. 3. The risk-free rate is based on that applied to ten-year bonds. 4. The risk premium has been estimated at around 5.4%, although each calculation has been adjusted according to the markets in which
each subsidiary operates.

144

Future cash ows were estimated considering:
a) Reasonable assumptions and management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset, based on information available at the analysis date.
b) Five-year projections that re ect the nancial and macroeconomic circumstances and those of the stainless steel market itself, adapted to the operating environment of each CGU analysed. The different parameters used (expected growth, use of installed production capacity, prices, working capital items, etc.) are therefore projected considering historical gures, particularly the last year closed, as well as targets set by management. Other relevant assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values at the time of the study.
The Company is con dent that the ows to perpetuity will materialise, mainly in terms of its use of production capacity and margins, while still applying prudent criteria to the growth rate (g). Estimated growth rates for the country and industry in which each CGU is present have been used, in addition to those for the markets to which most of their output is exported.
c) Estimated projections for years beyond the period covered have been calculated by extrapolating the previous projections using a growth rate of 2.5%. It should be noted that in 2017 the global stainless steel market continued to consolidate the historical market growth rate of 5.9% for the 1950-2017 period.
No impairment has been recognised on property, plant and equipment during the year, as the enterprise value, calculated applying the discounted free cash ow method, exceeds the carrying amount of the Group's operating assets.
The results of the impairment tests performed are detailed below:
Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd Bahru Stainless is the most recently created factory, located in Johor, Malaysia. In 2017, Bahru Stainless achieved positive EBITDA and increased its cold rolling production by 33.4% in a highly competitive market.
This factor operates mainly in markets of the ASEAN zone, where there is a signi cant price gap compared to other international markets largely due to the over-capacity in the Chinese market and the resulting pressure on international markets, especially in the Asia-Paci c region. In addition, the ASEAN countries and Asia generally reacted to Chinese over-capacity by instituting anti-dumping or protectionist measures in their local markets.
Nevertheless, according to the International Monetary Fund, the GDP of the ASEAN 5 region (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) grew by 5.3% in 2017.
The increase in production continued throughout the year, such that the subsidiary Bahru Stainless had set a new production record by year end, and it is expected to reach maximum production capacity in cold rolling production by 2020. This production increase has resulted and will result in larger shares in the ASEAN market, in addition to improvements in product quality.
The impairment test performed at 31 December 2017 reveals that its recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount (410.2 million euros) by 220.5 million euros (124.2 million euros in 2016). The discount rate (WACC), 8.66% (8.75% in 2016) the growth rate (g), 2.5% (2.5% in 2016), and the average budgeted EBIT margin, 4.7% (3.0% in 2016) were considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
Following a sensitivity analysis entailing different scenarios, impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 37.5% (17.1% in 2016). In the case of the growth rate (g), there would have to be a growth rate of 0% and the WACC would have to be increased by 17.8% (reducing g by 83% in 2016) for the carrying amount to begin to show impairment.
The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 38.8% (22.9% in 2016) to 2.9% (2.3% in 2016), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.
Acerinox S.C. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. This subsidiary markets part of the production of Bahru Stainless in the Malaysia market, and it was affected by low prices in the local market, as mentioned above.
145

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The impairment test performed at 31 December 2017 reveals that its recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount, 9.2 million euros (11.2 million euros in 2016) by 27 million euros (32 million euros in 2016). The discount rate (WACC), 8.64% (8.68% in 2016) the growth rate (g), 2.5% (2% in 2016), and the average budgeted EBIT margin, 3.2% (6.0% in 2016) were considered key assumptions in the impairment test.
According to the sensitivity analysis performed, impairment of the carrying amount would only occur by increasing the discount rate (WACC) by 2.54 times (2.50 times in 2016), while simultaneously bringing the growth rate (g) down to zero.
The average budgeted EBIT margin would have to fall by 68.3% (68.1% fall in 2016) to 1.0% (1.9% in 2016), with the other two assumptions remaining constant, for impairment to occur.
Impairment tests performed in 2016
With respect to companies presenting indications of impairment in 2016 and for those in which an analysis was not necessary in 2017 (Roldán, S.A., Inox l, S.A.). Both achieved pro ts this year, thus improving their future prospects. Even so, the analyses performed last year showed that the recoverable value of the companies' assets was higher than their carrying amount. The sensitivity analyses performed also led us to conclude that a signi cant change to all assumptions would be necessary for impairment to occur. Given that the earnings achieved this year were in line with budgeted earnings, the Group did not believe that it was necessary to perform the analyses.

NOTE 9 INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Investment property includes Group-owned buildings not occupied by the Group which are held to earn a return, either through rentals or through capital appreciation and subsequent disposal of the buildings.

The Group has several industrial bays in Spain and other countries classi ed in this category, and as investment property in different subsidiaries. These are industrial bays which were used to carry out commercial activity but are currently idle, and the Group thus intends to rent or sell them.

During this year one of the Group companies' industrial bays were sold, generating a pro t of 145 thousand euros. The net carrying amount of the disposed of property was 50 thousand euros. In 2016, the Group sold two of its industrial bays, which had been classi ed as investment property, generating a gain of 2.9 million euros. The net carrying amount of these bays totalled 2,382 thousand euros.
In 2016, an industrial bay belonging to the Group company Acerinox Italia, with a net carrying amount of 11.3 million euros, was transferred to this category.
Income from the lease of industrial bays amounted to 486 thousand euros in 2017 (378 thousand euros in 2016). The associated operating expenses, including maintenance and repairs, amount to Euros 196 thousand (Euros 94 thousand in 2016).
At 31 December 2017 investment property has a total market value of 22,888 thousand euros (23,329 thousand euros in 2016).
One of the Group's industrial bays showed indications of impairment in 2016, so the Group requested an independent expert appraisal. Based on this appraisal, the Group recognised an impairment of 570 thousand euros under other operating expenses in the income statement. During this year none of the industrial bays classi ed in this category showed indications of impairment.

Raw materials and other suppliers include 7,911 thousand euros re ecting the valuation of the emission allowances held by the Group at the end of the year (8,357 thousand euros in 2016).
The change in nished goods and works in progress in the year, according to the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 and 2016 shown above, differs from the gure in the income statement owing to translation differences.
The cost of goods sold has been calculated in accordance with the policy de ned in note 2.12 and amounts to 4,008 million euros in 2017 (3,600 million euros in 2016).
In 2017 the Group wrote inventories down to net realisable value where this was lower than cost, with a total adjustment of 2,273 thousand euros. The adjustment recognised for 2016 amounted to 1,188 thousand euros.
Commitments

At 31 December 2017 the consolidated Group has commitments to purchase raw materials for 208,756 thousand euros (243,080 thousand euros in 2016). Although no rm sales commitments exist at these reporting dates, there are formal orders for which the Group does not foresee any circumstances that could prevent delivery by the agreed deadlines.
The Group does not have any inventories with a cycle exceeding one year and therefore no borrowing costs have been capitalised.

Group companies have taken out insurance policies to cover the risk of damage to their inventories. The coverage of these policies is considered suf cient.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

10.1 Emission allowances
Pursuant to the additional provision of Royal Decree 602/2016 of 2 December 2016, the Group classi ed emission allowances as inventories.
On 15 November 2013 the Spanish Cabinet approved Acerinox Europa, S.A.U.'s de nitive allocation of free-of-charge greenhouse gas emission allowances for the 2013-2020 period, 1,867,754 allowances in total. The yearly distribution of the allowances is detailed below:

In 2017, CO2 emissions were made requiring 259,918 allowances, which will be surrendered in 2018 (258,406 in 2016, surrendered in 2017). The Group has not sold its surplus allowances.
The expense for the year in respect of CO2 emissions totals 1,926 thousand euros in 2017 (2,010 thousand euros in 2016) and is included under other operating expenses. This is the value of the allowances surrendered in the year, equivalent to the market value of these allowances when allocated.
Disposals for the year are allowances surrendered for CO2 emissions in the prior year. This information has been audited and approved by an independent expert.
Present conditions pose no signi cant risk of a shortfall in emission allowances for the 2017-2020 period. The Group does not hold any futures contracts for the acquisition of emission allowances.
No signi cant contingency exists in respect of nes over emissions.

No allowances have been made for bad debts with related parties in 2017 or 2016.

At 31 December 2017, certain Group companies had receivables factored without recourse totalling 149,915 thousand euros with nancial institutions in exchange for cash. This amount was equal to 85%-90% of the total amount of the factored invoices, depending on the conditions of the credit insurance coverage. (134,734 thousand euros in 2016). These amounts have been derecognised as they meet the conditions speci ed in IAS 39 regarding the transfer of risks and rewards.

As explained in note 11.2.3, at 31 December 2017, the Group company Columbus Stainless has pledged receivables as collateral for the nancing obtained through the Borrowing Base Facility.

In order to diversify the sources of its nancing and extend its debt maturities, in July 2014 the Group led a base prospectus for the issuance of xed-income securities of Acerinox S.A. for a maximum notional amount of 500 million euros at the Spanish National Securities Market Commission. Since then, Acerinox S.A. has carried out two issues through this prospectus: the rst issue of 75 million euros was placed by Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch in July 2014 with a term of ten years and interest of 5%, whilst the second was placed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. for a total of 50 million euros in December 2014 with a term of four years and variable interest of 3-month Euribor + 1.75%.

During this period, the bonds issued in 2014, totalling 50 million euros and with a maturity of 4 years, were transferred to current bonds.

Borrowings at xed interest rates only include loans originally arranged at xed rates (with banks and private placements), and do not include borrowings for which interest rates have been xed by contracting derivatives.

The fair value of xed rate loans and borrowings and private placements is 483,143 thousand euros at 31 December 2017 euros (carrying amount of 465,000 euros). The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2016 was 240,910 thousand euros (carrying amount of 230,000 euros).

Variable interest rates on loans are reviewed at least once a year.

At 2017 year end the Group's euro-denominated nancing instruments, 1.141 million euros in total, have a weighted average cost, before hedging, of 1.63%, while the average pre-hedging cost of borrowings in US dollars, amounting to 109 million US dollars, is 3.37%. In 2016, the Group's euro-denominated borrowings, 982 million euros in total, bore an average cost of 1.90%, before hedging, while the average cost of borrowings in US dollars, amounting to 94 million US dollars, was 2.43%.

The Group has arranged interest rate swaps whereby it can exchange the variable interest rates on its borrowings for xed interest rates, as described in note 11.2.6.

At 31 December 2017 accrued interest payable in respect of loans and borrowings totals 1,918 thousand euros (2,415 thousand euros in 2016). In addition, accrued interest payable on bonds issued totals 1,660 thousand euros at the 2017 reporting date (1,653 thousand euros in 2016).

Total borrowing costs calculated using the effective interest rate on loans at amortised cost amount to 2,808 thousand euros (2,253 thousand euros in 2016).

At 31 December 2017, the Group has credit facilities with nancial institutions with a maximum available limit of 1,964 million euros, of which 1,230 million euros was drawn down at 31 December 2017. At the 2016 year end, the maximum available limit from credit facilities was 1,819 million euros and the amount drawn down on that date was 1,218 million euros.

Certain Group companies have contracted reverse factoring facilities with various nancial institutions to manage payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of nancial institutions are recognised under "trade and other payables" until they are settled or repaid or have expired.

Main financing operations undertaken in the year

· In 2017, the Borrowing Base Facility of Columbus Stainless Pty Ltd. was restructured and the contracted term extended, in the amount of ZAR 3,500 million. The transaction, which was originally signed in 2015, was extended for another two and a half years, including modi cations in its structure to give Columbus greater exibility, while a new nancial institution was added to the group of lenders: Citibank N.A. South African Branch. The participating entities include Deutsche Bank AG, Johannesburg Branch, Bankinter S.A., Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A., FirstRand Bank Limited, Banco Santander S.A., Banco de Sabadell S.A. London Branch, Caixabank S.A., Investec Bank Limited, Nedbank Limited, HSBC Bank Plc Johannesburg Branch and Citibank N.A. South African Branch. The lead arranger of the transaction continues to be Deutsche Bank AG, Amsterdam Branch. This facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under "loans and borrowings" of current liabilities. At 31 December 2017 no amount has been drawn down from this facility.

· In addition, in June 2017, another non-extinctive amendment was made to the syndicated factoring agreement of 370 million euros, extending the termination date of the contract to June 2019. The participants in the transaction have not changed and they include Santander Factoring y Con rming S.A. E.F.C., Banca March S.A., Caixabank S.A., Popular de Factoring S.A. E.F.C., Bankinter S.A., Banco Sabadell S.A. and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur International S.A. The lead arranger of the transaction continues to be Santander Factoring and Con rming S.A. E.F.C.

· Lastly, Acerinox S.A. capitalised on good market conditions and signed eight new loan agreements in 2017 and an annex amending an existing loan, for an aggregate amount of 725 million euros, as follows:

- An annex to amend an existing loan was signed with Banco Santander.

- Loans signed Banco de Sabadell, Bankia, Banco Santander, Banco Popular and Bankinter to cancel existing loans with the same entities, improving their conditions and extending their repayment due dates.

- New loan agreements signed with Banco Social de Crédito Cooperativo, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Banca March and the European Investment Bank totalled 210 million euros. The loan signed with Banca March was transferred to a securitisation fund upon signing, through which an international investor took a position in the loan, with Banca March acting as the intermediary.

Of the 725 million euros in nancing referred to in the previous paragraph, 570 million euros was recognised as non-current loans and borrowings in the accounts. There are two reasons for this difference. On the one hand, the loan signed with the European Investment Bank for 70 million euros was not drawn down this year. Regarding the loan of 100 million euros that we have with Banco Santander, with whom we signed an annex amending that loan in 2017, during this year only 35 million euros have been drawn down (of which 20 are classi ed as current), and the remaining 65 million have been drawn down in 2018.
Regarding the amount that appears in the cash ow statement under external nancing received (695,133 thousand euros), this includes short and long-term loans, and other non-current payables, mainly obtained through advances on grants or subsidised loans.
The most signi cant nancing transaction during 2016 was the debt rescheduling of the majority of the bilateral loans held by Acerinox S.A. During April and May 2016, the Parent Company signed twelve bilateral loans for terms of between 4 and 5 years, thus extending the

153

Consolidated Annual Accounts
repayment due dates and reducing the margins. The twelve nancial institutions with which Acerinox S.A. signed these agreements are Banco Santander, Banco de Sabadell, Banco Popular, Bankia, Kutxabank, CaixaBank, Abanca, Unicaja, Banca March, Banco Cooperativo, Liberbank and Bankinter. The total amount of these loans was 717 million euros (part of them classi ed as current). Given the resulting variations, for the most part the Group recognised the effects of these new agreements as if they were new loans, and therefore simultaneously recognised the cancellation and the new loans.
Furthermore, on 30 June 2016, Acerinox S.A. repaid early the syndicated loan arranged in the United States in January 2012. The outstanding balance of this loan at the date of early repayment was USD 134.96 million. This loan originally fell due on 17 February 2017.
The Acerinox Group has satisfactorily met the repayment schedules for its nancial debt. Non-current borrowings subject to covenants a) Ratios linked to profit and loss
The loan agreement that Acerinox signed with the ICO (Spain's Of cial Credit Institute) in 2008 and which matures in July 2018, and is therefore classi ed as current, is the Group's only nancing with a ratio-linked covenant relating to the Group's income. Speci cally net nancial debt/ EBITDA, and net nancial debt/equity. At year end, the outstanding amount repayable on the ICO loan was USD 16.3 million.
b) Ratios linked to equity
At the 2017 reporting date there are two new nancing contracts subject to covenants, relating to the maintenance of minimum consolidated equity levels. This is the contract signed in 2017 with Banca March for the amount of 50 million euros and assigned to an asset-backed securities fund as soon as it was signed, and the loan arranged with European Investment Bank (EIB) in December 2017 for an amount of 70 million euros, an amount that is yet to be drawn down as there is an agreement with said institution to draw down the funds in June 2018. These types of ratios are common market practice for loans with these terms, since the loan arranged with the European Investment Bank has a term of 10 years and the loan brokered through Banca March is for 7 years.
Additionally, the Group company Columbus Stainless has structured nancing (Borrowing Base Facility) which is also subject to covenants relating to the maintenance of minimum equity levels in that company. This facility is recognised in the balance sheet at the amount drawn down, under bank borrowings of current liabilities. At 31 December 2017 no amount has been drawn down from this facility.
At the 2017 year end (as in 2016) Acerinox, S.A. and Columbus Stainless Ltd comply with all ratios required under the contracts mentioned above.
With regard to 2016, none of the 12 loan agreements signed in the rst half of that year are subject to nancial covenants.
During 2016 the Acerinox Group reached an agreement with Banco Santander and OeKB (Austrian export credit agency) to amend the loan in order to eliminate compliance with the nancial covenants attached. The syndicated loan signed in 2012 with a group of nancial institutions in the United States was repaid early on 30 June 2016, and the covenants attached were thus eliminated.
Finally, on 30 December 2016 the loan extended by Deutsche Bank and JBIC (Japan Bank for International Cooperation) was repaid early, and compliance with the nancial covenants attached was thus eliminated. This loan originally fell due in July 2017. 11.2.4 Measurement of fair value As established in the accounting policies, the Group measures available-for-sale nancial assets and derivative nancial instruments at fair value.
Financial instruments measured at fair value are classi ed based on valuation inputs into the following levels:
LEVEL 1: quoted prices in active markets LEVEL 2: observable market variables other than quoted prices LEVEL 3: unobservable market variables
154

LEVEL 3 0

No nancial assets or nancial liabilities at fair value have been transferred between levels.
In the case of Level 2 nancial instruments, the Group uses generally accepted valuation techniques that take into account spot and future exchange rates at the valuation date, forward interest rates, interest rate spreads and credit risk of both the Group and its counterparty, i.e. the
nancial institutions with which it operates.
11.2.5 Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale nancial assets total 14,763 thousand euros at year end, of which 14,474 thousand euros re ect Acerinox's investment in the Japanese Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited., which is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The quotation value was JPY 1,852 per share at 31 December 2017 (JPY 1,441 per share at 2016 year end). Acerinox, S.A. holds 1,052,600 shares in this company, representing a percentage ownership of 0.96%, both in 2017 and 2016. This is a strategic investment that Acerinox has no intention of selling. Nisshin Steel has an interest of 15.49% in Acerinox. In addition, it not only holds a signi cant interest in Acerinox, S.A. but is also Acerinox's partner in Bahru Stainless, Sdn. Bhd, which is the Group's fourth at product stainless steel factory.
Acerinox S.A. has not purchased or sold any shares in Nisshin Steel Holding Co. Limited in 2017 or 2016.
In 2017 and 2016 the Group recognised the variation in the fair value of assets classi ed in this category in reserves. The revaluation amounted to 2,145 thousand euros in 2017 (1,948 thousand euros in 2016).
Also in 2015, the Group company Acerinox Europa acquired a non-controlling interest of 7.36% in the company Fortia Energía, S.L., whose corporate purpose is the acquisition of electricity on behalf of its shareholders, for 275 thousand euros. The Group's Spanish factories can obtain more competitive electricity prices as a result of this investment. This investment is measured at cost of acquisition, as there is insuf cient data to measure it at fair value. In any event, the Group does not consider there to be indications of impairment.
11.2.6 Derivative financial instruments As detailed in note 4, in relation to market risk, in its activities the Group is essentially exposed to three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and risk of changes in prices of raw materials. The Group uses derivative nancial instruments to hedge its exposure to certain risks.
The Group classi es derivative nancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as assets and liabilities at fair value through pro t or loss. Those that qualify as hedging instruments are classi ed as hedging derivatives and are recognised by applying the measurement criteria de ned in note 2.11.4.

The reduction in cross currency swaps is mainly due to the amortisation of part of the loan granted by the ICO in USD, the only loan hedged through this type of derivative nancial instrument.
On 30 June 2016, Acerinox S.A. cancelled early the derivative arranged in January 2012 with 4 nancial institutions to hedge the currency and interest rate risk of the syndicated loan signed in the United States. The cancellation cost recognised in pro t and loss was 957 thousand euros. This amount appears under nance costs.
Currency risk
The Group operates in a large number of countries and bills customers in different currencies, depending on the country where it is billing. Therefore it uses certain nancial instruments to hedge cash ow risks arising from the settlement of balances in foreign currencies. The contracted operations mainly comprise forward sales and purchases in foreign currencies.
Derivative instruments of this kind do not always qualify to be classi ed as cash ow hedging nancial instruments in accordance with IAS 39. At 31 December 2017, a loss of 29,836 thousand euros was recorded in pro t and loss for the measurement of these derivatives at market value and they are recognised under "Fair value measurement of nancial instruments" in the income statement (gains of 29,988 thousand euros in 2016). The Group's exchange gains amounted to 40,054 thousand euros (22,424 thousand-euro loss in 2016).
At 31 December 2017 all exchange rate insurance policies basically cover both receivables (assets) and payables (liabilities) and include both trade and nancing transactions between Group companies. At 31 December 2017, the fair value of the Group's exchange rate insurance totalled -11,059 thousand euros (-19,034 thousand euros in 2016), of which 17,007 thousand euros is recognised under assets and 28,066 thousand euros under liabilities. Only 18 thousand euros of this amount, classi ed under liabilities, quali es for recognition as hedging instruments. In 2017 an amount of -147 thousand euros was transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to pro t and loss for the year (-167 thousand euros in 2016).
All of the Group's forward currency purchase and sale contracts have a term of less than one year.

156

At 31 December 2017 the Group has used contracts for foreign currency transactions amounting to 328 million euros for currency sales and 527 million euros for currency purchases. At 31 December 2016, 326 thousand euros were used for sales and 426 million euros for purchases. Details of these forward exchange contracts by currency are as follows:

The Group has contracted derivatives to hedge exposures to currency and interest rate risks affecting its loans and borrowings in currencies other than the functional currency. These instruments are described in the next note.

Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2017 the Group has arranged the following interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, for loans in currencies other than the functional currency of the company in question, to hedge the interest rate risk of a part of its current and non-current loans and borrowings:

In 2017 no additional interest rate hedges have been arranged.

The average interest rate applicable to USD-denominated nancing for which an interest rate hedge has been arranged through a derivative nancial instrument is 3.65% (3.55% in 2016), while the average rate for euro-denominated nancing with an associated interest rate hedge,
totalling 22.4 million euros at year end, is 4% (3.89% in 2016). The credit spread has been included in both cases.

Details at 31 December 2016 were as follows:

Consolidated Annual Accounts

The fair value of the xed interest rate swaps and the cross currency swaps is based on the market value of equivalent derivative nancial instruments at the reporting date and amounts to 154 thousand euros (3,354 thousand euros at 31 December 2016), which is recognised as follows:

At 31 December 2017 and 2016 the derivatives contracted qualify as cash ow hedging instruments and therefore the unrealised loss of 4,528 thousand euros on their measurement at fair value has been recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss of 7,193 thousand euros in 2016).
In 2017, an amount of 6,138 thousand euros was transferred from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to pro t and loss for the year (12,656 thousand euros in 2016). Combined with the -147 thousand euros derived from the currency hedges referred to in the previous section, these totalled 5,991 thousand euros, which appear in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (12,489 in 2016).
The Group has documented the effectiveness of the derivatives contracted to be recognised as hedging instruments, as detailed in note 2.11.5. Hedging transactions have been contracted for periods and amounts equivalent to the cash ows derived from the loans associated with each instrument. The nancial instruments that are considered hedges were not ineffective at any point in 2016 or 2017.

There have been no changes in share capital during 2017.

During the 2016 nancial year, at their General Meeting the shareholders agreed to increase share capital with a charge to reserves by issuing ordinary shares to be allocated to the shareholders free of charge. In addition, the Board of Directors resolved to implement the capital increase by means of a scrip dividend. The capital increase, through the issue of 9,360,150 shares derived from the scrip dividend, was led at the Madrid Mercantile Registry on 18 July 2016. These new shares were admitted to trading on 22 July 2016.

b) Share premium

There has been no distribution of the share premium in 2017 or 2016.

The share premium is subject to the same restrictions and may be used for the same purpose as the voluntary reserves of the Parent Company, including conversion into share capital.

c) Treasury shares

On 15 June 2015 the Parent Company acquired 100 own shares to be exchanged for subscription rights, if necessary, when executing the scrip dividend. There was no movement in own shares in 2017 or 2016.

13.2 Distribution of dividends

With respect to 2016, at their General Meeting on 9 June, the shareholders approved the remuneration of shareholders in the form of a exible dividend (scrip dividend), for which it approved a capital increase charged to reserves by issuing ordinary shares free of charge to shareholders.
Shareholders could choose from the following options:
- Sell their rights to the Company for 0.44 euros per right. - Sell the rights in the stock exchange at the price set by the market. - Subscribe to shares in Acerinox on the basis of one (1) new share for every twenty-two (22) rights.
On 1 July 2016 the de nitive amount of the dividend payable and the details of the capital increase were established, as follows:
- 60,784,070 rights were sold to Acerinox for 0.44 euros per right, with the Company therefore paying out 26,744,990.8 euros. - 9,360,150 new shares were issued in the capital increase.
13.3 Reserves
a) Retained earnings
Retained earnings include consolidated pro t or loss for the year and reserves in fully consolidated companies, as well as Parent Company reserves other than those mentioned below.
Details of reserves by company are included in note 13.5.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of funds by any Group company in the form of dividends, except for the non-distributable reserves required by applicable legislation. At 31 December 2017 27,037 thousand euros of the Group's reserves and retained earnings are subject to restrictions (23,569 thousand euros at 31 December 2016).
The Parent Company's legal reserve, which is included under retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity, has been appropriated in compliance with article 274 of the Spanish Companies Act, which requires companies to transfer 10% of pro ts for the year to a legal reserve until this reserve reaches an amount equal to 20% of share capital. At 31 December 2017 the Company has appropriated 12,465 thousand euros, an amount equivalent to 18.25% of its share capital, to this reserve (18.06% in 2016), totalling 12,599 thousand euros in 2017 (12,465 in 2016).
The legal reserve is not distributable to shareholders and if it is used to offset losses, if no other reserves are available, the reserve must be replenished with future pro ts.
b) Property, plant and equipment revaluation reserve
As permitted by Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of 7 June 1996, containing urgent tax measures and initiatives aimed at boosting and deregulating the economy, the Parent Company revalued its property, plant and equipment. The amount of the reserve re ects the revaluation gains, net of tax at 3%.
The deadline for tax inspection was three years from 31 December 1996. Consequently, as no inspection took place, this balance can be used to offset losses or increase the Company's share capital.
The balance of this account will only be distributable, either directly or indirectly, to the extent that gains have been realised.
c) Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve includes cumulative net changes in the fair value of cash ow hedging instruments associated with highly probable future transactions that are yet to occur.
d) Adjustment of available-for-sale assets to fair value
The Company has classi ed certain nancial instruments as available for sale. In accordance with the applicable measurement criteria, any changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income until the nancial asset is impaired or derecognised. There is a detailed description of instruments classi ed as available for sale and their measurement in note 11.2.5.
160

e) Actuarial valuation reserve This reserve includes the changes in the actuarial value of de ned bene t plan obligations.

The two companies with non-controlling interests are Columbus Stainless, Ltd, 24% of which is held by the South African group IDC (Industrial Development Corporation) and Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd, whose main non-controlling shareholder is Nisshin Steel Holding. Co, Ltd. with an interest of 30%, in addition to Hanwa, Co. Ltd., which has a 3% interest. Details of the assets of these two Group companies are as follows: Columbus's total assets amount to 524 million euros (476 million euros in 2016), of which 136 million euros are non-current (147 million euros in 2016). The total assets of Bahru Stainless, Sdn. Bhd. amount to 861 million euros (940 million euros in 2016), of which 617 million euros are non-current (736 million euros in 2016). Neither of these companies distributed dividends in 2016 or 2017.

13.6 Distribution of earnings and shareholder remuneration
The distribution of earnings of the Parent Company, Acerinox, S.A. for 2017, as proposed by the Board of Directors, to be submitted to the shareholders for approval at their Annual General Meeting is as follows:

Basis of allocation: Pro t for the year

2017 7,998,570

Application: Legal reserves Prior years' losses

799,857 7,198,713

As regards shareholder remuneration, at the Board of Directors' meeting of Acerinox held on 20 December resolved to propose to the next Annual General Meeting the distribution of dividends in a single payment to be made in July 2018.
At their General Meeting held on 1 June 2017, the shareholders agreed that the Parent Company's pro t for 2016 should be distributed as follows:

Basis of allocation: Pro t for the year
Application: Legal reserves Prior years' losses

2016 1,336,281
133,628 1,202,653

13.7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the pro t for the year attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding own shares purchased and held by the Group.

(Expressed in thousands of Euros) Pro t attributable to the Group Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding Earnings per share (in Euros)

0.85

2016 80,320
270,895,787 0.30

The weighted average number of shares has been calculated considering the shares outstanding both prior and subsequent to the capital increase and the number of days for which they had been outstanding.

The Group has not issued any nancial instruments that give access to capital or convertible debt and therefore diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

NOTE 14 DEFERRED INCOME
Non-refundable government grants, which include emission allowances received free of charge (see note 10.1) and other capital grants are included under this heading. Movements in this account are as follow:

(Datos en miles de euros) Balance at 1 January Grants awarded Application to results Balance at 31 December

2017 7,798 2,482 -3,333 6,947

2016 7,513 3,815 -3,530 7,798

The amount recognised in deferred income primarily re ects grants received by Acerinox Europe for its research and development activities, and the balancing entry for emission allowances allocated free of charge under the National Allocation Plan and not used during the year (note 10.1).
The Group considers that it has met or will meet all the conditions for receipt of these grants in the period stipulated and therefore no signi cant contingencies exist in connection with the grants obtained.

The amount recorded under pension plans comprises the contributions made by North American Stainless to pension plans for certain employees. These liabilities have been duly externalised and the Company has no additional obligations. The Company has recorded an asset for the same amount.

164

There are obligations under from certain contractual covenants agreed with Senior Management in the amount of 9.9 million euros (8.7 million euros in 2016). These obligations were properly insured and their estimated amount covered by cash ows arising from the insurance policies contracted. As a result, no liability in this connection is recognised.

Post-employment obligations re ect post-retirement medical care plans provided by Columbus Stainless to speci ed plan members. No new members have joined the plan. The Company performs actuarial valuations of the obligations every two years. The most recent valuation was performed this year. The assumptions made were as follows: discount rate of 9,5% (9% according to the previous valuation performed in 2015) and 6,75% in ation of medical services (7% in the prior valuation). The opening balance for the period reconciles with the closing balance as follows:

2016 7,048 -298

1,217 8,896

The discount rates applied are based on expected growth rates of health insurance. Any change in such fees may have an impact in the recognised obligations or in comprehensive income. An increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would increase the obligation by 1.2 million euros. In contrast, a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate would reduce the obligation by 1.1 million euros. With respect to 2016, an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would result in an increase in the obligations of 1.4 million euros, while such a decrease would reduce the obligations by 1.1 million euros.

These are provisions for CO2 emissions during the year for which the emission allowances have not yet been surrendered at the year end (see note 10.1).

Applications for the year are mainly due to the derecognition of emission allowances for 2017, totalling 2,014 thousand euros (1,942 thousand euros in 2016) (see note 10.1).

Litigation

With regard to the tax-related lawsuits that have been ongoing between the Group and the tax authorities in Germany and Italy since 2011, due to transfer pricing adjustments imposed in both countries, which are explained in detail in note 18.5, the Group has decided to make a provision of 6,092 thousand euros for any amounts payable arising from the inspection in Germany and 7,195 for adjustments arising from the inspection in Italy. In November this year, the Group received noti cation from the Spanish and German authorities of the resolution through the Mutual Agreement Procedure. After the agreement reached between the two countries, the transfer pricing adjustments initially imposed

165

Consolidated Annual Accounts
on the Group were reduced by 40%. However, the agreement only covers transactions between Spain and Germany, so there is uncertainty about how the German inspectors will treat adjustments originating from third countries for purchases of stainless steel made by the company Acerinox Deutschland, GmbH. The Group has decided to make a provision for the potential risk of these adjustments, and the difference between the tax rates in Spain and Germany owing to the agreements nally reached between the authorities of the two countries. With respect to Italy, although negotiations between both countries (Spain and Italy) are yet to begin, the Group has decided to treat this in the same way as Germany. Therefore, it has made a provision for the maximum amounts that it could have to pay for adjustments originating from third countries (non-members of the European Union), and the difference in tax rates between both countries. In 2016 a balance of 168 thousand euros was recognised due to a claim received from CDTI to repay a portion of a grant given in 2009 to a consortium of eleven companies, including Acerinox. As a result of the economic crisis and regulatory changes in relation to alternative energies, certain members of this consortium led for insolvency, and the CDTI demanded the amount of the grant that had not been justi ed from the other companies of the consortium. This year, the Group has been forced to pay the amount of 180 thousand euros for this claim, of which 31 thousand were for grants awarded to Acerinox Europa, which the Group has derecognised, thus cancelling the provision. Other provisions Other provisions mainly re ect Inoxcenter, S.L.U.'s estimate of the probable obligations totalling 386 thousand euros arising from the workforce restructuring plan implemented in 2013 pursuant to Royal Decree-Law 5/2013. Furthermore, as referred to in note 8, in the section relating to the environment, this year the Company recognised a provision for environmental activities for the amount of 45 thousand euros, for the rehabilitation of land owned by the Group company Columbus Stainless.
15.3 Guarantees provided
At 31 December 2017 the Group has provided guarantees to third parties, mainly government bodies, totalling 20 million euros (18 million euros in 2016). This amount includes the guarantee provided to the Italian taxation authorities for the amount of 1.8 million euros, as a result of the assessments arising from the inspection, as explained in note 18.5. Group management does not expect any signi cant liabilities to arise from these guarantees.
15.4 Contingencies
In addition to the tax contingencies discussed in note 18.5, in 2016 Gas Natural Comercializadora, S.A requested that declaratory proceedings be opened against the Group companies Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A. and Inox l, S.A. for an alleged breach of the natural gas supply contracts and requested the payment of the compensation due to unilateral termination, as agreed in these contracts, totalling 8.2 million euros. Gas Natural Comercializadora S.A. submitted a bid in the supply service tender held by Acerinox during 2016 and 2017, but a different company was selected. The Group considers that it is unlikely that any amount payable will arise following the related legal proceedings that are underway. The judicial proceeding is continuing, and the trial is expected for the rst quarter of 2019.

Interest income mainly derives from term deposits by the Group (note 12).
Finance costs mainly re ect interest accrued on loans and borrowings and bonds issued, which are explained in note 11.2.3.
Lastly, income from translation differences arise in the Group's trade, nancial operations and investments. The Group hedges with derivative nancial instruments a majority of the transactions carried out in a currency other than the functional currency of a country. Using these instru-
ments ensures that any uctuation in exchange rates would be offset by a contrary change of the same amount in the derivative contracted. The amount recorded in exchange gains in the year is due mainly to the 13.3% devaluation of the USD.

NOTE 18 TAXATION

18.1 Legislative amendments
Tax reform in the United States

On 22 December 2017, the biggest tax reform in the United States in the last 30 years was approved, and it applies to tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The main measure is the reduction of the federal tax rate from the 35% that has been applicable to date, to 21%. This tax reduction is very positive for the Group, not just for the future because of the reduced tax burden on revenue generated by the Group subsidiary North American Stainless, but also because of the impact that this tax cut has on the deferred tax liabilities recognised by the Company.

The impact of this reduction in the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities has been recognised this year and is detailed below:

Deferred tax assets (temporary differences) Deferred tax liabilities (temporary differences) Reserve repatriation tax
Total impact on earnings in USD

Balances prior to the reform (amounts in thousands of USD)

74.294

Balances at 31/12/17 (amounts
in thousands of USD) 3.807
-147.144

Total impact on earnings in Euros

65.741

The positive impact of the tax reform amounts to 65,741 thousand euros (74,294 thousand USD), broken down as follows:

· 69,107 thousand euros (78,098 USD) correspond to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities arising mainly from the different tax and accounting treatment of amortisation and depreciation of assets.

· A negative amount of 1,671 thousand euros (-1,888 USD) corresponds to the reduction in deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences for provisions that are not tax-deductible.

· The company made a provision of 1,695 thousand euros (-1,916 thousand USD) for the tax on undistributed accumulated income of investees.

At the same time, the reform includes a series of other measures, with the following having a possible impact on the Group:

· "Bonus depreciation": allows 100% of the asset value to be tax deductible in the year in which it is put into service. This measure applies to all assets put into service between 27/09/17 and 01/01/23. From that date onwards, the deduction is reduced to 20% per year. In the nal quarter of 2017, the Group company North American Stainless put into service a cold-rolling mill and a bright annealing (BA) line, thus qualifying for this deduction. Making this deduction leads to a temporary difference liability and reduces the tax payable in the United States, but does not affect the Company's earnings.

· The deduction established for American manufacturing companies ("section 199 - domestic manufacturing deduction"), which NAS has thus far been applying, has been eliminated. Despite the negative effect that this could have, it is clearly offset by the effect of the reduction in the tax rate.

· "Deemed repatriation toll charge": 100% exemption has been introduced for the investee companies of American companies, in exchange for an additional, mandatory toll charge. This charge is calculated according to the cumulative earnings in the American company's investee companies since 1986. The tax rate applicable ranges from 8% to 15.5%, payable in 8 years. The applicable rate depends on whether or not the reserves are in the form of liquid assets. The company North American Stainless has made a provision of 1,695 thousand euros for an amount payable in 8 years, for its accumulated reserves in the investee company in Canada.

170

Other measures introduced by the tax reform, which have also been assessed by the Group, but which are not expected to have any signi cant impact, are as follows:
· Offsetting of tax loss carryforwards: it will be possible to offset these with 80% of the income generated in future years. This eliminates the time limit and the possibility of offsetting with pro ts from previous years. This measure has no impact on the Group as it does not have any tax loss carryforwards yet to be offset.
· "Global intangible low-taxed income" (GILTI): This is an expansion of the international tax transparency regime and makes earnings obtained by subsidiaries from the exploitation of intangible assets taxable in the United States. This measure does not affect the Group has it has no earnings from the exploitation of intangible assets.
· "Foreign derived intangible income" (FDII): this introduces a new preferential regime (foreign-derived intangible income) for low taxation (13.125%; 16.406% from 2025) on earnings from the explotation of American intangible assets abroad. The Group does not expect any adjustments to be required due to this measure.
· Limitation of interest expense deductibility: all interest may be deducted up to a limit of 30% of EBITDA+financial income. Any interest not deducted in a year may be used in future years, without any time limit. This limit will be 30% of EBIT from 2022. This measure has no impact on the Group as the American company has no external nancing.
· "Base erosion anti-abuse tax" (BEAT): this is a minimum tax of 5% on payments made to foreign affiliates (excluding payments for purchases), provided that they exceed 3% of total operating expenses. In the case of the Group, the payments currently being made by the American company to the rest of the Group's companies do not exceed the set limits.
Spain There have been no signi cant tax changes this year that alter the Group's tax burden.
On 2 December 2016 a new suite of tax measures aimed at shoring up public nances was approved in Spain. Among the tax measures approved, the measures that have an impact on the Group are as follows:
· Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, the limit on the deduction of prior years' losses is reduced, for those companies with revenues of over 60 million euros, to 25% of the taxable income earned in the year. Since the Group has capitalised tax credits in Spain, this measure increased the periods in which they can be recovered. The recoverability of the Group's tax credits is analysed in note 18.3.
· Also, from 1 January 2016, the impairment of investments in Group companies recognised for tax purposes prior to 2013 and not yet offset at that date are offset within a maximum of ve years. The amount to be offset is the greater of the following two: the pro t earned by these companies in the tax period or one fth of the amount not yet offset. Impairment on investments pending reversal by the Group at 1 January 2016 amounted to 64,675 thousand euros. For 2016, the Company offset tax amounting to 15,032 thousand euros, and this year estimates a tax offset of 13,037 thousand euros, so the balance yet to be offset at 31 December 2017 is 36,606 thousand euros, to be offset in the next 4 years.
· A limit was set on the application of double taxation relief at 50% of the gross tax payable.
· As of 1 January 2017 onwards, the exemption of gains arising from the transfer of investments is also applicable to losses, which therefore will not be deductible, unless the company is extinguished.
As regards instalment payments, Royal Decree 2/2016 also introduced substantial changes aimed at increasing proceeds in this respect. In addition to increasing the percentage for the calculation of the interim payment, a minimum amount of 23% of the pro t re ected in the income statement is thus established for the rst three, nine or eleven months of each calendar year. This amount is to be decreased only by the amount of the instalment payments made previously for the same tax period.
Legislative amendments in other countries In 2017 and 2016, the following tax rates applicable to certain Group companies were amended pursuant to local legislation:
- The tax rate in Luxembourg was reduced from 29.22% to 26.01%. This rate reduction has led to revenues of 1.2 million euros for the
171

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Group, as the entity owned by the Group in this country has liabilities of 10 million euros from temporary differences.
- In Malaysia, the tax rate was reduced from 25% (applicable since 2015) to 24%, applicable for years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This rate reduction has had no impact on the nancial statements of the Group's companies in these countries, as they have no recognised deferred tax assets.
- The tax rate in Italy was reduced from 27.5% to 24%. The Group reduced the tax credits recognised in this country as a result of the rate reduction, leading to a higher tax expense of 2.2 million euros.
- U.K.: a progressive modi cation has been made to the income tax rate. The rate applicable from 1 April 2016 was 20%, 19% from 2017 and 17% from 2021. The Group has deferred tax assets and liabilities in this country, which it recognised at 17%.
- Chile: a progressive increase in tax rates has been applied, from 17% in 2013 to 27% from 2018 onwards. The applicable rate in 2016 was 24%, increasing to 25% in 2017.

In 2017 the Parent Company received dividends from some of its foreign subsidiaries amounting to 13.5 million euros (15.3 million euros in 2016). Under the corresponding double taxation conventions, some of these dividends were subject to withholdings at source amounting to 1,351 thousand euros (1,177 thousand euros in 2016), which have been recognised under other taxes in the income statement. This account also re ects other withholdings, mainly on interest paid to Group companies.

Tax incentives not recognised in the income statement relate to deductions for R&D, deductions for the elimination of double taxation and the deduction for American producers (the "Section 199 deduction")

The Group's tax expense has been affected by several extraordinary factors this year. On the one hand, there has been a positive impact from the tax adjustment for its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the United States as a result of the tax reform in that country, totalling 67.4 million euros. At the same time, the Group has recognised provisions of 13.3 million euros as a result of tax assessments, as detailed in note 15.2. Finally, as explained in the section on deferred tax liabilities (note 18.3.1), the Group has recognised a liability for the repatriation of reserves from its subsidiaries, totalling 26.7 million euros (1.7 million euros for the charge imposed in the United States for the non-distributed reserves of the American company's subsidiaries. (See note 18.1) and 25 million are explained in note 18.3.1). Without these effects, the tax rate for this year would have been 35%, compared with 47% last year.

Consolidated Annual Accounts

Most of the deferred taxes have a reversal period of more than one year.

As laid down in the income tax measurement criteria (note 2.18), the Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to do so, the assets and liabilities correspond to the same taxation authority and it plans to realise current tax assets or settle current tax liabilities on a net basis. The offset of 35 million euros shown in the table above mainly relates to the offsetting of deferred tax assets of the Spanish consolidated tax group in the amount of 24 million euros, and to temporary asset differences of the companies North American Stainless (5.7 million euros) and Colombus Stainless (4.4 million euros).
18.3.1 Deferred tax liabilities

Deferred tax liabilities recognised in property, plant and equipment are mainly due to the different tax and accounting depreciation criteria permitted by legislation in force in certain countries. These liabilities essentially relate to North American Stainless, Inc. and Columbus Stainless, Ltd.

Certain companies in the consolidated Group have reserves that could be subject to taxation if they were distributed.

The Group has a shareholder dividend policy whereby the dividends are approved every year at the shareholders' General Meeting, not subject to any criteria whereby a percentage of net bene t is distributed ("pay out"). The criteria adopted by Acerinox has always been to set remuneration levels in euros per share. This criterion has always been followed, even in years when losses were made. In the last twelve years, shareholder remuneration has remained at 0.45 euros per share, although during the 2013-2016 period, those shareholders who so requested were able to avail themselves of a "scrip dividend", receiving shares with an equivalent value from Acerinox.

An analysis of the holding company's nancial position shows that, having distributed dividends over the last six years and charged them to reserves, it would be able to cover a repatriation of reserves from its subsidiaries for an amount of 250 million euros. This repatriation of reserves, combined with the holding's existing reserves, ensures that it can continue to cover share dividends for the next ve years. Having analysed the nancial position of each of the subsidiaries, their working capital needs and future strategic plans, the Group believes that such a distribution will come from the Group company in the United States, North American Stainless. Dividends from the United States are subject to a 10% withholding at source, so the Group has made a deferred tax provision of 25 million euros.

The Group believes that any future need beyond the analysed ve-year period can be covered by the future earnings generated by the subsidiaries. It does not seem likely that, beyond the current ve-year period, it will be necessary to repatriate additional reserves from North American Stainless, so preferably, for the purpose of nancial and tax optimisation, the Group will also try to cover its needs through dividends from subsidiaries that do not entail any additional tax burden.
18.3.2 Deferred tax assets

At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group has unused tax credits from tax losses available as follows:

132.418 136.493

2016 446
4.226
144.853 149.525

The Group also has uncapitalised tax credits totalling 66,429 thousand euros in respect of certain Group companies' tax losses of euros 284 million (uncapitalised tax credits of 64,021 thousand euros in 2016), which have not been recognised as they did not meet the necessary criteria. The period for recovery of these credits is open ended, in accordance with prevailing tax legislation.

The Group has unrecognised assets of 9.4 million euros arising from temporary differences relating to accounting impairment which is not tax-deductible.

On 22 June 2015, the Group company Bahru Stainless received con rmation from the Malaysian Ministry of Economy of approval of scal aid in respect of investments made in the country from 2009 to 2014. This aid consists of income tax deductions for an amount equal to the investments made in certain items of property, plant and equipment, which amount to 1,806 million Malaysian ringgits (371 million euros). The company submitted the rectifying tax returns accrediting the amount of aid receivable. As with tax credits relating to tax loss carryforwards, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset as it cannot yet estimate their recoverability.

174

The Group company North American Stainless also has tax credits for investments in assets that contribute to recycling. These credits are deducted from the calculation of the Kentucky state tax and amounted to 526 million euros at the year end. During this year, the Group obtained further tax credits of 50.8 million as a result of the new investments made in 2017, many of which qualify for tax relief. Of all the tax credits, 13.5 million euros expire in 2020, 20.8 million euros expire in 2028 and the rest are unlimited. Application of these credits is limited to 50% of the tax payable in the state of Kentucky, or an amount of USD 2.5 million/year. With the ten-year estimates made, the Group expects to be able to use an amount of 15.8 million euros, which the Group recognises as a deferred tax asset.
The Group only recognises a deferred tax asset for investment tax credits that expire and relate to a speci c credit programme approved in 2005 by the state of Kentucky (Major Credits Program). Given the limits established for their application, a portion of the deferred tax assets from investments which the Group had capitalised at 31 December 2016 (which expire in 2020) were not recoverable on that date, so the Group recognised an amount of 5.2 million euros in reserves.
18.3.3 Analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group prepares projections of pro t and loss on an individual basis for all companies with available tax credits to determine whether the credits will be recoverable within a reasonable timeframe and within the periods stipulated by respective legislation. To this end, the Group requests a budget covering ve to ten years from each company with capitalised tax credits, for calculation of taxable bases in order to determine the recoverability of the tax credits. Furthermore, the Group takes into account the limitations regarding offsetting tax loss carryforwards stipulated in certain jurisdictions. The Group also assesses the existence of deferred tax liabilities against which tax losses may be offset in the future.
During this year, the Group has used tax credits totalling 13 million euros. All of the Group's subsidiaries that have capitalised tax credits have achieved pro ts, in line with budgeted pro ts, so the situation is more favourable than in past years. When preparing the budgets, the Group has taken into account the nancial and macroeconomic circumstances and those of the stainless steel market itself, adapted to the operating environment of each entity. Parameters such as expected growth, use of installed production capacity, prices, etc. are therefore projected considering historical gures, particularly the last year closed, as well as targets set by management. Key assumptions such as exchange rates and raw material prices are extrapolated using highly conservative criteria, referring at all times to the most recent market values at the time of the analysis. The estimates made for future years have operating margins that are similar to those budgeted in the 2016 estimations.
Based on all of the above aspects, the directors believe that, in spite of the new limits introduced in some jurisdictions, particularly in Spain, all capitalised tax credits are still likely to be recovered through future taxable income for all companies within a reasonable period of less than 10 years, and within the periods permitted by the corresponding local legislation in each country. The tax credits capitalised were the result of the crisis years and the Group has been reducing these credits since 2013.
A sensitivity analysis has been made of these estimations, especially for the credits of the Spanish consolidated tax group, as it accounts for 75% of the Group's capitalised tax credits. The Spanish consolidated tax group comprises Acerinox, S.A., Acerinox Europa, S.A.U., Roldan, S.A., Inox l, S.A., Inoxcenter, S.L.U. and Inoxcenter Canarias, S.A.U. As a result of the analyses, it is estimated that projected income would have to decrease by 7% for the recovery period to increase to 11 years. In addition, the estimation would have to be reduced by 16% for the recovery period to increase to 12 years. In addition, the Group has also taken account of the potential impact in Spain of the increase in unused tax loss carryforwards as a result of amicable settlements reached in inspection proceedings undertaken in Germany and Italy (both explained in note 18.5). Because the recovery periods are ample for other companies with capitalised tax credits at year end, no sensitivity analysis was necessary.
18.4 Current tax At 31 December 2017 the Group has a current tax asset of 20,717 thousand euros (12,254 thousand euros in 2016) and a current tax liability of 21,212 thousand euros (3,418 thousand euros in 2016).
In addition to increasing the percentage for the calculation of the interim payment, the approval of Royal Decree 2/2016 in Spain established a minimum amount of 23% of the pro t re ected in the income statement for the rst three, nine or eleven months of each calendar year. This amount is to be decreased only by the amount of the instalment payments made previously for the same tax period.

18.5 Tax inspections and years open to inspection
18.5.1 Tax inspection Developments in 2017 All decisions received in 2017 relating to inspections have been favourable.
· In the case of Spain, the tax procedures relating to VAT import duties for imports commenced this year have concluded with no adjustments.
· With respect to Portugal, this year part of the amounts arising from the amicable settlement procedure between the Spanish and Portuguese authorities at the end of 2016 has been received. The amount recovered in Spain is 1.3 million euros (plus 254 million in interest), in addition to the increase in tax credits of 179 thousand euros. Furthermore, at the reporting date we had been informed of the repayment of 0.6 million euros in Portugal.
· In South Africa, the tax authorities have agreed to eliminate all proposed adjustments in the assessments corresponding to 2010, 2011 and 2012.
· In Germany we have been informed of the finalisation of the Mutual Agreement Procedure between Spain and Germany for the years 2007-2010. These agreements entail a 40% reduction in adjustments relating to transactions between Spain and the German subsidiary. Meanwhile, the Group has presented a bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) to cover the transfer prices applied to sale and purchase transactions between Spanish manufacturers and the distributor. The negotiations between both companies have now concluded and the Group is going to sign the agreement at the end of February 2018.
· The tax inspections under way in France ended this year with no adjustments.
· During the period, inspections carried out in the Switzerland subsidiary of the years 2012 to 2015 also ended with no adjustments.
The situation with regard to each of the tax inspections that are underway or which have concluded but are being disputed and appealed against at the end of 2017 is detailed below:
Spain On 26 July of this year, noti cation was received of the start of customs-related inspection proceedings (VAT import duties) in relation to 2015. On 3 November the assessment was approved and signed without any adjustments, bringing the procedure to an end.
On 7 January 2016, the Economic-Administrative Tribunal issued a ruling upholding in full the submissions led by Acerinox, S.A. against the assessment decisions arising from the inspection of rights, anti-dumping and VAT for 2009, 2010 and 2011. On 27 April of the same year, agreements to enforce the rulings were received for the amounts of 925 thousand euros in respect of anti-dumping, which had previously been guaranteed, 649 thousand euros for VAT on imports (which had been deducted by Acerinox at the time) and 41 thousand euros in respect of payable external tariffs. The Company led an appeal against the assessment decisions, contesting the interest calculation. 61 thousand euros relating to guarantee expenses were also recovered.
Portugal In the year 2011, tax inspections were conducted in the Group company Acerol Ltda., in Portugal, on taxes for the years 2007 and 2008. They resulted in a transfer pricing adjustment for sale and purchase transactions between the company Acerol, Ltda and Group companies, primarily Acerinox, S.A. and Roldán, S.A in Spain. The adjustment to taxable income amounted to 10 million euros. However, as the subsidiary had tax losses of 6.7 million euros pending offset, the amount paid totalled 708 thousand euros. These assessments considered that no offence had been committed and, accordingly, no tax penalties were imposed. On 31 July 2012 an application was submitted to the Directorate-General for Taxation through the European Arbitration Convention based on Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990. This Convention guarantees the elimination of double taxation due to transfer pricing adjustments within the European Union. Following negotiations between the Spanish and German tax authorities, or an arbitrator's ruling if necessary, this initial adjustment, or whichever adjustment is agreed, will therefore be offset by a counter-adjustment in the other member state.
On 28 December 2016, the affected Spanish companies received the noti cations relating to the agreement reached between the Spanish and Portuguese authorities that nalised the Mutual Agreement Procedure. On 17 January 2017 the same agreement was received by the Portuguese company. Under this agreement, the Spanish and Portuguese authorities accepted the complete elimination of the double taxation.
176

Under these agreements, pursuant to the assessments, the adjustment made in relation to Acerol by the competent Portuguese authority was reduced from a total of 10 million euros to 4 million euros for 2007 and 720 thousand euros for 2008. At the same time, the competent Spanish authorities made a correlative adjustment of the same amount in relation to the various Spanish Group companies affected. In 2016, the Group recognised the refundable amounts in Spain, which amounted to 1.3 million euros, in addition to an increase in tax credits amounting to 179 thousand euros. At the same time, the Portuguese entity recognised a refundable amount of 0.6 million euros.
In June 2017, the Spanish tax agency implemented a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) and an agreement was reached whereby the Group recovered 1.3 million euros for 2007 income tax, plus 254 thousand euros in interest in Spain. In addition, tax loss carryforwards increased by 719 thousand euros.
Execution of the agreement in Portugal, in addition to the return of previously paid sums amounting to 633 thousand euros, is pending. At the reporting date, the Group had been informed of the repayment of the above amounts.
South Africa On 24 June 2014, notice was received of the initiation of a tax inspection on transfer prices for 2010 to 2012 at the Group company Columbus Stainless (Pty) Ltd. In 2015 the assessments were received, nalising the inspections. The assessments stipulated adjustments to taxable income in relation to transfer prices, amounting to 32 million euros. These adjustments did not result in any payable amounts in South Africa, as the company had carried forward tax losses which exceeded the amount of the assessment. The assessments did not impose any penalties.
Subsequent to the ling of the related submissions within the periods established, in 2016 the Company was noti ed of the possibility of engaging in alternative proceedings to resolve the dispute related to 2010 by appointing an independent arbitrator ("Alternative Dispute Resolution"). The company considered it appropriate to exhaust all options prior to resorting to the courts. The outcome of the procedure was highly satisfactory for the Company, as it received noti cation from the South African tax authorities on 7 February 2017 agreeing to eliminate all proposed adjustments relating to 2010. The noti cation also validated the transfer price policy put in place by the Group. In October 2017 we also received noti cation that the SARS had agreed to withdraw all proposed adjustments for the years 2011 and 2012.
Germany As regards the tax inspections for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 that were initiated in 2011 at the Group subsidiary Acerinox Deutschland, GmbH, the assessments of the income tax, solidarity surcharge and VAT were received on 8 July 2014. The assessments primarily indicate transfer pricing adjustments to the tax base totalling 58.8 million euros for sale and purchase transactions between the subsidiary and the Group's manufacturing companies. No penalties were imposed. The company led the pertinent submissions on 8 August 2014.
The amounts payable in Germany as a result of these assessments were 384 thousand euros for the VAT assessments, 2,804 thousand euros for income tax plus the solidarity surcharge and 489 thousand euros in interest. All tax loss carryforwards yet to be offset were also eliminated. These amounts were paid in 2014.
In November 2015 requests were submitted for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Germany. Any adjustment relating to transfer prices for transactions completed with companies resident in Spain is protected by Convention 90/436/EEC on the elimination of double taxation.
On 5 October 2017, we were informed of the nalisation of the Mutual Agreement Procedure and the agreements reached for the years 2007-2010. These agreements entail a 40% reduction in adjustments relating to transactions between Spain and the German subsidiary. In November written acceptance of the agreements was submitted and they are currently pending execution. In Spain, the Group estimates that it will recover 3.8 million euros of interest and obtain an increase in tax credits of 3.7 million euros, which will be recognised in the affected companies as soon as the tax agency sends the settlements arising from the agreements. In turn, in Germany, the Company estimates a repayment of 5.6 million euros and a reduction in tax credits totalling 10 million euros. As mentioned in note 15.2. the Group has recognised a provision for 6 million euros, for the differences between the amounts received in Spain and the amounts payable in Germany, mainly resulting from tax rate differences between both countries and the transfer price adjustments originating from transactions made in other countries.
The Group is currently in negotiations with the German authorities to also make the agreements applicable to adjustments relating to third countries.
On 29 November 2016, noti cation was given of the commencement of tax inspections for the years 2011-2014. The authorities decided to postpone their proceedings on transfer prices until the proposed Mutual Agreement has been settled. It is currently suspended and, in view of the nalisation of the agreements, no further adjustments are expected.

Consolidated Annual Accounts
Furthermore, this year the Group companies Acerinox Europa, S.A.U, Roldan, S.A., Inox l, S.A., and Acerinox Deutschland, GmbH submitted to the tax authorities of their respective countries a request for a bilateral advance pricing agreement to cover the transfer prices applied to sale and purchase transactions between Spanish manufacturers and the distributor. The negotiations between both companies have now concluded and the Group is expecting noti cation of the agreements reached in the rst quarter of 2018.
Italy In 2011 the subsidiary Acerinox Italia S.r.l. underwent an inspection of taxes for 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Between 2012 and 2014 the assessment notices for the three years were received, primarily indicating transfer pricing adjustments in relation to sale and purchase transactions between the Company and the Group's factories. The resulting payable tax amounted to 16 million euros, plus 3.5 million euros in interest. No penalties were imposed. There have been the following developments in relation to the assessments: The company challenged these assessments in appeals led by the respective deadlines before the provincial tax commission of Milan, in which it was also requested that stays be placed on the tax debt until completion of the proceedings. These stays were accepted by the Italian authorities, subject to the pledging of bank guarantees for an initial amount of 7.9 million euros. Furthermore, on 9 December 2013 an application was submitted to the Spanish authorities requesting the elimination of double taxation based on Convention 90/436/EEC of 23 July 1990. This Convention guarantees the elimination of double taxation due to transfer pricing adjustments within the European Union. Following negotiations between the Spanish and Italian taxation authorities, or an arbitrator's ruling if necessary, this initial adjustment, or whichever adjustment is agreed, will therefore be offset by a counter-adjustment in the other member state. The Spanish Directorate-General for Taxation and the Italian authorities have con rmed their acceptance of the initiation of the procedure. The initiation of the Mutual Agreement Procedure allows the taxpayer to reduce the bank guarantees provided. The Group has reduced the guaranteed amounts to 1.3 million euros.
Italian legislation requires that internal appeals be withdrawn to accept the international arbitration proceedings to eliminate double taxation. Therefore, after it was announced that the proceedings had been accepted, the Group withdrew the internal claims relating to transactions with countries in the European Union.
In addition to the transfer pricing adjustments for 2007, 2008 and 2009, the assessment contained less signi cant adjustments for 2006 to 2009. The maximum risk of these adjustments amounted to 1.6 million euros (including interest). The company eventually decided to settle with the Italian authorities for 336 thousand euros, which were included as a tax expense in the income statement for the year.
On 28 December 2016, and with no prior noti cation of the initiation of inspection procedures, the Company received an assessment relating to transfer prices for the year 2011, automatically applying similar criteria to previous inspections. This led to adjustments in the tax base of 4.3 million euros, yielding a payable amount of 1.5 million euros plus interest. No penalties were imposed. On 26 May, the relevant arguments were submitted to the Italian tax authorities. In July 2017 we were informed of the temporary suspension of debt repayment without submitting any bank guarantee. In November requests were submitted for the elimination of double taxation in both Spain and Italy.
In November 2011, with no prior noti cation of the commencement of tax inspections, the company Acerinox Italia received a further assessment of transfer prices relating to 2012, giving rise to adjustments to the tax base of 4.9 million euros and an amount payable of 1.6 million euros, plus interest. The company expects to follow the same steps as with previous procedures, within the established periods.
In view of the agreements reached for Germany, the Group believes that it is likely to be required by the Italian taxation authorities to adjust certain amounts, mainly resulting from tax rate differences between both countries and the transfer pricing adjustments originating from transactions made in third countries. Therefore, the Group has decided to make a provision of 7 million euros, to cover the maximum risk arising from the adjustments currently being proposed, for the years 2007-2012.
Malaysia On 24 and 28 December 2014, notice was received of the start of a tax inspection of the Group company Bahru Stainless Sdn. Bhd. for the years 2010 and 2011. Subsequently, on 4 March 2015, noti cation was received that the inspection was to be extended to 2012 and 2013. All requested information has been submitted to date. On 25 November 2015 a noti cation was received that the inspection had been postponed until further notice. On 23 February 2017, noti cation was received of the resumption of the tax inspections, but for the years 2010-2014. They are currently underway, with all requested information having been submitted.
In addition, on 20 January 2015 noti cation was received of the commencement of an inspection of the company Acerinox SC Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. in relation to transfer prices in the period from 2010 to 2013. All the information requested has been submitted and, to date, no report on the ndings has been received which would allow conclusions to be reached with regard to any adjustments.
France On 29 November 2016 the Group company Acerinox France, S.A.S was noti ed of the commencement of a veri cation of the tax returns for 2014 and 2015. The procedures were completed this year without signi cant adjustments.
178

Poland
On 2 December 2016 noti cation was received of the commencement of tax inspections at the Acerinox Group company Polska Sp. Zoo for income tax for 2015. The inspection relating to income tax ended with no adjustments, and the procedure relating to transfer prices is pending review. The Company has submitted all information requested to date. The authorities have extended the inspection period to April 2018.

Switzerland
During this period, inspections were carried out in the Switzerland subsidiary for the years 2012-2015. The inspection was concluded without any adjustments.

18.5.2. Years open to inspection
In accordance with current legislation, taxes cannot be considered de nitive until the submitted tax returns have been inspected by the tax authorities or until the inspection period has elapsed.

Spain
Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law, tax loss carryforwards declared in the tax returns for years open to inspection become statutebarred ten years from the day following the deadline for ling the tax return or self-assessment for the tax period in which the right to offset arises. Once this period has elapsed, taxpayers must submit the assessment or self-assessment and the accounting records, as well as evidence that they have been led at the Mercantile Registry during the aforementioned period, in order to demonstrate that these tax loss carryforwards and the amount thereof are appropriate.

At 31 December 2017 and 2016, Acerinox, S.A. and the companies in the consolidated tax group have all the main applicable taxes open to inspection by the tax authorities for the following years:

1. Business model
Acerinox is one of the world's top companies in stainless steel manufacturing. It operates on an international level with factories on four continents and a strong commercial presence with sales in 85 countries.
Since it was founded in 1970 with chie y Spanish capital and a minority of foreign capital from the Japanese industrial group Nisshin Steel and the Nissho Iwai Corporation, it has had a single business objective; the manufacture and sale of stainless steel, both directly and through subsidiary companies.
Acerinox has three factories featuring integrated production processes for at products; the Factory at Campo de Gibraltar (Spain), North American Stainless, N.A.S. (USA) and Columbus Stainless (South Africa). The Bahru Stainless plant (Malaysia) is a cold rolling plant.
With reference to long products, the Group also has the Spanish plants of Roldán and Inox l and NAS long product plant.
Acerinox has an extensive commercial network, made up of 35 sales of ces, 26 warehouses, 18 service centres and 15 sales agents, which form a logistics network covering 56 countries on the ve continents.
The Acerinox workforce is one of the most diverse among all the companies listed on the Spanish stock market, not only in matters of gender, but also in race, culture, religion and language, due to the international character of the Group.
Acerinox has always preferred inde nite working contracts for its employees; quality, well-paid contracts. It also promotes career plans for full professional development, through internal promotion.
The group structures are light, its factories have the best ratios of productivity worldwide, and its central services are the most reduced of the sector.
Acerinox aspires to continue as international leader in the manufacture of stainless steels in order to satisfy the needs of its customers.
Respect for the natural environment is one of the building blocks of the model, and it forces the various public powers to recall that they should not compromise with those who nd a contempt for environmental regulations or a violation of the rights of workers provides them with a competitive advantage over companies from more socially advanced countries.
Furthermore, it aspires to remunerate its shareholders annually, even during a period of crisis, and maintain investments in order to achieve productive excellence and have the best and most ef cient facilities in the entire sector.
Having broken down completely 100% of Manufacturing and Sales into subsidiaries, the Parent Company has become an administrative and coordinating holding company, and as a consequence, its corporate purpose is performed exclusively through its subsidiaries.
These subsidiaries are of two types: manufacturers and traders, and even if, every time there is a tendency for ef ciency reasons to increase the tons that are served and invoiced directly from the plants, the presence on a very decentralized network will continue to be necessary to be able to attract and attend clients from the 5 continents.

Stainless steel pipes.
Stainless steel is the only product directly related to the activity of the Group, since to date no attempt has been made to participate in upstream activities, such as mining or the extraction of raw materials, nor has any attempt been made to intervene in the distribution and storage activities, nor in those involved in transportation. The idea that, in an increasingly-competitive activity with large supply surpluses, only the hyper-specialization and search for savings, ef ciencies, and synergies across the entire production and distribution chain allows them to maintain the desired margins was the real in uencer in this decision.
Acerinox is the only truly global company in the sector, with plants on four different continents and Number 1 in at least two of them. This geographic diversi cation facilitates the optimization of the role that the Group plays in each market and for shifting sales towards the best margins. Acerinox is a global company that thinks and acts locally on many different sites. This omnipresence equips them with a high-response capacity and overall resilience when the market gets into dif culties. Currently Acerinox enjoys a world market share of around 6%, 12% in Europe, 35% in the USA being the leading company in their sector in the country, 80% in South Africa, and 10% in the ASEAN market.

Today, leading-edge technology facilitates high-level production with minimal environmental impact. Since its creation, Acerinox's activity has been based on using scrap as their primary raw material and has converted the plants of the Group into ef cient recyclers. Since its creation in 1970, tens of millions of tons of scrap have been recycled converting Acerinox into a pioneer in Circular Economy, forty years before this concept was invented.

The Senior Management of the Group promotes the effective implementation of the Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the ISO 14001 standard. In 2017, Acerinox destined 101 million euros towards environmental expenses.

Acerinox has plants in 4 different continents and a world market share of 6%.

2 Risks and their management

Acerinox has a Risk Management Model for identifying, classifying, and evaluating any possible event that could affect all the units and signi cant functions of the organization as well as establishing the control and responsibility mechanisms derived from each one of them. The Model has as the ultimate objective of providing reasonable security for attaining objectives, whether strategic, operational, compliance, or reporting.

For the correct implementation of the measures and the strict monitoring of its ful lment in each one of the possible risks, the Group approved in 2010 the Risk Management Control Policy of Acerinox, S.A. and their Group of Companies.

Through the Policy, the mechanisms and basic principles are established for the management of opportunities and risks that allow them to:

· Achieve the strategic objectives determined by the Group. · Provide full guarantees for the shareholders. · Protect the Group's results and reputation. · Defend the interests of the key Interest Groups of the Company. · Ensure business stability and financial solidity in a sustained manner over time.

Any business activity has associated to it a series of risks in general and, in the case of steel making, Acerinox recognizes and classi es the uncertainties characteristic of the sector in which it operates.

Moreover, the substantial risks facing the Company on a daily basis requiring full-time management and special surveillance are inter-related and can be summarized in the following diagram:

a. Overcapacity Surplus on a global scale, which would result in lower prices.

b. Raw Material Price Volatility Big variations, especially in short periods of time.
c. Economic Cycles Demand in products in light of developments in the markets.

3. Acerinox Group general policies
In 2016, the Board of Directors, following a report by the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, approved eight general policies which, in the future, will de ne the direction, approach and general guidelines of the Company and its Group of companies in the following matters, corresponding to their heading and content:
· General Policy for Selection of Directors · General Policy of Corporate Social Responsibility · General Policy for the Remuneration of Directors · General Policy for Risk Management and Control · General Policy for Communication and Contact with Shareholders and Investors · Tax Policy · General Corporate Governance Policy · General Treasury Stock Policy On 1 June 2017, the General Shareholders' Meeting endorsed the General Policy for the Remuneration of Directors. All these policies are available on the Company's website so that they can be viewed and compared by any interested party. Above all, we have tried to embody the principles of integrity and the culture of hard work which has formed part of Acerinox's character since its creation.

4 Sustainability indicators
4.1 Environmental Matters Improving the different environmental indicators with programmes aimed at reducing the impact on the environment and the ef cient use of resources is the main strategy of the Acerinox Group. In order to attain a degree of excellence in environmental performance, the Company continually evaluates the environmental impact of its activity, striking a balance between ef cient production and the least variation possible in the environment. The Group participates on a worldwide level in climatic change prevention projects and collaborates at sectoral and European level in product environmental studies.
The Company analyses the different environment impacts, developing tools for their assessment, and makes decisions related to climatic change and the life cycle of stainless steel with the attainment, as a result, of constant improvements in the protection of the environment in which the Group operates. The result of this analysis and assessment not only improves the environment but also the Company. Senior Management promotes the effective implementation of the Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the ISO 14001 standard or the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) at NAS. In view of the activity that Acerinox carries out, one of the most important factors of the EMS is the ef cient use of materials and all other resources.
The Acerinox Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) report for the 2017 period was externally audited for the rst time and carried out by KPMG Auditors.
1) Materials In the Annex information of this document (Table 1) the total consumption of materials used in production in 2017 enabling the attainment of the different monitoring indicators is detailed.
During 2017, the percentage of the materials recycled that are used in the manufacturer of stainless steel amounts increased to more than 65% which is considerably higher than the previous year.
It is quite evident that Acerinox made the correct decision to base their activity on electric-arc furnaces smelters of scrap, not only for being a decision more environmentally advanced but also for its economic effectiveness: the scrap is raw material with an important discount on the aggregate value of the metals that it incorporates. If there is an example on how being environmentally responsible is more economically bene cial to your Company, this is it. Since the creation of the Group, tens of millions of tons of scrap have been recycled in the steelworks of Acerinox Group, who in 1970 had already created a Circular Economy with its associated bene ts.
2) Water The activities developed by the Acerinox Group require a considerable amount of water. Thus, the struggle takes place on two fronts: reducing water consumption and therefore the costs and returning the water that is borrowed in the same conditions as its natural state.
Saving water saves money. The Group plants recycle all the water it uses that, in turn, is used many times before being puri ed and returned to the environment.
The Company uses the most advanced methods and treatments during the process. These practices also restore it to its former quality after the ltering process and extracts the substances added during the production processes.

Consumption varies substantially between plants due to the differences in air temperature and, in turn, evaporation temperature, and the different refrigeration requirements of the equipment and products which are manufactured. In the case of Columbus, due to the use of rainwater of which its measurement is not recorded.

In all cases, the quality of the water returned into the environment is monitored by the Company itself as well as the Authorities.
At NAS, the water is returned to the Ohio River, from where it is taken, through a diffuser to reduce its impact, in Campo de Gibraltar this is done through an underwater pipeline several kilometres long that returns water to the Mediterranean.
At Columbus the greater part of the water used comes from rainfall. Various reservoirs collect it during the rainy season and store it for the rest of the year.
3) Energy The manufacture of steel is electro intensive and anything aimed at reducing energy consumption, as well as reducing indirect emissions, makes substantial savings.
With exception of NAS, energetic policies in countries where the plants of the Group are found suffer from a lack of forecasting making the cost of energy high. Hence, once again, appropriate environmental management is also the most ef cient for the business. Table 2 of the annex shows the energy consumption of Acerinox Group.

4) Emissions The Group's production activities are subject to strict emission controls, as well as the ful lment of yearly objectives. In 2020, the period for recording the Greenhouse-Gas Emissions (GHG) comes to an end in Europe and over the next few years the rights to free emissions are going to be reduced. Appropriate environmental management has enabled the plant at Campo de Gibraltar to optimize the use of free emission rights and operate with 231,350 free CO2 emission allowances. The next emission period shall begin with the possibility of being able to apply the surplus allowance rights from the period (2012-2020) in the years to come, avoiding the need to resort to the rights market. Plants of the Group outside Europe are not subject to this market, even though their CO2 emissions are similar to those of the plant in Spain. Unfortunately, in Spain, there is no system that compensates for the indirect costs of CO2 emitted by power generators, and the same is transferred to the price of electricity making it extremely expensive. This is an issue that the Government want to take advantage of and that the Industry needs to resolve. Once again, the Group holds the position as being one of the most ef cient companies in reducing emissions, according to the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF), with a direct emission intensity 35% lower than the average of the rest of the stainless steel manufacturers in the world.

In order to reduce NOX emissions, the plants have catalytic towers, where NOx vapours are converted into molecular nitrogen, so that the NOx emissions are well below the strict legal limits.
Since 2012, Acerinox has participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), whose reports are considered to be the most reliable and accurate by experts, analysts and the international community at large. This year, once again, it has awarded Acerinox a high score thanks to its signi cant CO2 emission control.
Following the recommendations of the diverse international standards, the Acerinox Group calculates the direct emissions GHG (Scope 1) coming from consuming fuel, the indirect emissions GHG (Scope 2) coming from consuming electricity and nally other indirect emissions GHG (Scope 3) coming from the travel of employees and professional trips. The data for each emission calculation can be found in Table 3 in the Annex Information.
The veri cation of these emissions is performed by a body authorised for this activity in compliance with ISO standard 14064-1:2006; the foregoing being an important transparency exercise. Total emissions in 2017 were up over last year due to higher production, even though the efforts made have maintained or reduced emissions per ton of steel produced in the majority of the plants.

Columbus Nas Acerinox Bahru

The Company collaborates with the Union of Steel Companies (UNESID), preparing the inventory of CO2 emissions for the Ministry for the Environment and developing the MIRAT project as part of the Law of Environmental Responsibility.
Columbus employs the ISSF methodology to calculate its CO2 emissions, which are always well below the limits required by local legislation. Their emissions are higher than in the rest of the plants due to the lower availability of scrap in its market.
Although the USA is not a signatory of the world agreements on the reduction of emissions, the Group has applied to NAS the same good practices as in Europe and achieved equivalent results, with speci c emissions whose levels are very similar to those in our European plants.

Chimneys manufactured with stainless steel at Ciudad Real Airport.
The source of the relatively high speci c emissions generated by Bahru is clear: the start-up of its equipment and the learning phase, as is seen in the fact that the higher the production the lower the speci c emissions.
5) Effluent and waste Waste generated Waste types generated by each plant are not 100% the same and have been reduced to a normalized group for comparative purposes (please refer to Table 5). The plant in Bahru is the exception once again, as it still lacks its own steel mill and, therefore, cannot be compared with the others, but publishes its gures as part of an informative exercise aimed at increasing awareness of the matter.
In the slag-processing plant, the metallic content from the waste is extracted, recovering metal with a degree of alloying elements, that are then sent to be smelted again (except in the case of Bahru as explained in the previous paragraph). The resulting slag is regarded as non-hazardous, with the corresponding bene t for its subsequent use. Smoke powder is a dangerous by-product that is sent, together with other residues (mill scale and PRA powder) to a metal extraction plant. When smoke powder has gone through this process it is no longer a dangerous by-product. The extracted metal is reused as raw material in the steel-blast furnaces.
Across the different plants, wax paper, mill scale, pallet, discarded pieces, halogen bulbs, printer toners, oils and used acids, of ce paper, plastic, cardboard, shoot blasting, electric and electronic goods are recycled, amongst others.
Lastly, this year only 4% of the hazardous waste managed by the plant of Palmones (Algeciras) has required international transportation. Part of the smoke powder and mill scale generated in the process is sent to France for metal recovery. For plant-by-plant information, please refer to Table 4 in the Annex Information.

Use of waste products Stainless steel is a product which is highly sustainable and can be recycled as many times as required without its characteristics diminishing or deteriorating after each cycle, thus promoting a decrease in the exploitation of natural resources and a reduction in the amount of waste. With the aim of achieving greater ef ciency, the Company has developed its smelting technology by using an extremely high percentage of recycled material, exceeding the global average for steel manufacturers, according to the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF).
It is essential to assess the environmental implication of the entire product life cycle, from the manufacturing process to the end of its service life. To do this, the Company participates in the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) promoted by the European Steel Association. This is an internationally recognized, structured method to quantify the emissions, resources consumed as well as the impact on the environment and health related to the products placed on the market thereof. The scope of the method encompasses the extraction of the raw materials right through to the useful life of the product.
Steel can be found in countless applications across industry. It is interesting to note how other sectors are also committed to the environment, especially by means of the equipment used for renewable energies such as solar power, the construction of energy-ef cient buildings, water treatment plants, etc.
Discharge of waste water At the Acerinox Europa plant the recirculation of water is implemented by treatments throughout the industry. The treated water that is not recirculated and released ful ls the tipping standards set by the Integrated Environmental Authorisation (Autorización Ambiental Integrada - AAI). In 2017 the adaptation of the AAI was granted to the Best Possible Techniques.
At Columbus the water is treated in reservoir dams whilst in Bahru it is cleaned in the treatment plant. At NAS it is released into the Ohio River, treated and monitored, in strict compliance with environmental regulations.
Spill prevention Acerinox Group plants have strict measures to prevent, avoid, and resolve spillages from tipping or storing substances. In 2017 there were no spillages recorded in the Group's plants because of these preventative measures. All the plants have neutralization plants for treating acid and basic waste water as well as emergency dams and other security mechanisms for containing any possible spillage.
The tanks are also equipped with a rigid inner tank for non-visual leaks, with an emergency stop function systems, and emergency cleaning service.
There are internal procedures of the EMS according to ISO 14001 standard for avoiding and resolving any incident. NSM-9019 is an internal standard to tackle and manage these types of situations and serves as a practical guide for staff at the plant.
The Environmental Policy of the Company has prevented any environmental incident and has made staff aware of the importance of these good practices.

6) Environmental expenditure and investment This year the upgrade process of the Integrated Environmental Authorisation (Autorización Ambiental Integrada - AAI) of the plant in Campo de Gibraltar was completed. The Authorisation recognizes that the facilities at this plant have been adapted to the Best Techniques Available. To comply with the foregoing, the Company invested in: installing an enclosure system between the scrap and furnace warehouses, as well as between the furnace and the AOD, a skylight closing system, and improving the efficiency of the electric furnaces, AOD, and wind breaks in the slag area. It is expected that this investments are operational this year.
Last year, the Acerinox Group spent 101,047,847 euros on environmental items. To this gure, an investment amounting to 6,360,538 euros, mainly to reduce the diffuse emissions of the melting shop, needs to be added which results in an increase of more than 600 thousand euros over the last nancial year.

4.2 Social and Labour Matters a. Health and Safety at work The Acerinox Group is particularly strict and demanding when it comes to adopting the measures necessary for guaranteeing the safety of their employees. The metal industry is not without its risks, which means extra efforts should be made to reduce them as much as possible. For this purpose, the Group has a rigorous Health and Safety Policy, self-in icting more than that provided for in the Law in force. Acerinox adds what they believe to be an essential and inevitable item on the Agenda of its Governing Bodies, that of monitoring accident rates and the loss of work hours due to illness. As a result of this rigorous risk monitoring, the number of accidents occurring at all of the Group's factories is steadily decreasing. This exhaustive monitoring also reaches the safety measures in place in subcontractors who use workers, either permanently or occasionally, at our workplaces. Our terms and conditions establish as a breach of contract for subcontractors any serious non-compliance with safety measures applicable to subcontracted personnel, measures for which the standard is set by Acerinox, and not by the subcontractor. During 2017, there were a total of 109 accidents that caused the employees in question to take leave with another 58 not having to take leave. The number of work days lost for these absences increased to 3,976. At the Columbus Stainless plant someone died at work, which affected an employee of a sub-contracted company.

In addition, through its OHSAS 18001:2007 Management System, Acerinox has established a procedure based on its internal process for the identi cation of hazards, risk assessment, and planning and control of these risks in accordance with PSS-431-1.Rev.2, as well as a Health and Safety procedure for investigation into accidents and incidents (PSS-452-3).
The good practices programmes implemented during the nancial year at the request of the Safety and Environment Department of Campo de Gibraltar plant makes for a safer and healthier work environment. For this purpose, the process lines, operability of the safety elements checks, and the service companies have been audited.
Again this year Columbus's Health and Safety Programme is based on OHSAS 18001 standards and on its own Health Management System and the regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. In addition, since 1998, the renovation of the certi cate for complying with the ISO 14001 standards has been granted.
NAS also has good practice programmes, achieving very high ef ciency levels, continuing with its policy of Zero Accidents, in accordance with the OSHA Form 300 regulations.
During the financial year, Bahru took additional measures above the standard set by its own country by implementing the European safety standards right from the beginning. These additional measures contributed to their being able to carry out the entire building work and installation thereof without any serious accidents and is now an example to follow in the area for demanding the same measures from their sub-contractors.
Every single one of the employees of the Group are represented by Safety and Health Committees who hold meetings with Supervisors and Managers from the different areas in order to update any policies as deemed necessary.
b. Employment The Group offers stable, well-paid work. In the plants and the parent company, 90% of the contracts are inde niteterm contracts and those that are not are temporary or work experience agreements.
The work conditions attract talent and create a loyal workforce, this rotation indices can be seen in Table 7.
The Group provides all employees with the medical cover necessary in the case of accident, and complies with the Law so that the same have full access to the services on offer by the different social security programmes in each respective country. Each company of the Group offers an extensive and different range of social bene ts. The Group makes no distinction between the bene ts offered to full-time and part-time staff and the notice periods are always in compliance with the law in force in each country. Likewise, there are no activities in the Acerinox Group in which the right to freedom of association and the right to bene t from collective agreements are at signi cant risk, also Acerinox subscribes to the principles of the Global Compact.
Regarding maternity and paternity leave, 187 people exercised their right to take leave this year, returning to work at the end of this period.
Finally, both the Acerinox Group and the different Works Council inform the workers about any change or update of the collective labour relations. The Group ensures the correct distribution of the information related to salary updates, paid leaves, appointments or relevant changes in the organization chart, vacations, scholarships, schedules and calendars. Also, both the Groups Direction and the Works Council receive, through the procedures enabled for this, suggestions and queries from the company's employees.

c. Training workers Acerinox Group considers that professional development is a basic right for the individual and a need for the company. The training of a rst-class steelworker requires time, investment, and dedication and to achieve this, the Group is continually making substantial investment in training.
In 2017, according to the hours of training received from the Acerinox Group, a total of 1,139 quali ed workers received 28,402 hours, 746 administrative workers 10,985 hours and 5,552 labourers 222,200 hours.
Some of the training courses were mandatory, required, and periodic, such as those on Safety and Prevention of Risks and others were strongly recommended by the Company, as well as through systems based on collective negotiation.
There is no one more experienced for giving these training sessions than those who have spent the best part of their professional life carrying out the corresponding tasks. This is why, the majority of the courses are run by active staff or retired employees in the pertinent areas.
In any event, without appropriate training, there is no quality or innovation. During 2017, the Group's companies awarded a total of 53 grants to employees so that they can work and study subjects related to the plant's activities at the same time.
In 2017, the Group assessed a total of 3,706 workers. A breakdown of the results and assessment percentages can be found in Table 8.
With a view to involving all its employees in this challenge, Acerinox conducts important internal training programmes and each year organizes the Rafael Naranjo Awards, worth 45,000 euros, to reward the best ideas in this eld.
d. Diversity and equal opportunities Since its creation, Acerinox has shareholders and a Board of Directors who are multinational and, by default, multilingual. Diversity is an integral part of the Company.
You can find in the current Board of Directors four different continents, four out of the same with nationalities different to Spanish. The Board, following the Recommendations of the Good Governance Code for Listed Companies, commits to procure that by 2020 at least 30% of their Board Members belong to the minority represented gender and with this objective in mind has appointed three new Independent female Directors to increase the number of female members of the board to 4.
It is the Acerinox Group's wish, whose advancement it actively encourages, for its companies to be managed mostly by local personnel rather than by expats, as it considers that one of the keys to success is understanding the local culture in order to act and think in a global manner.
In some countries the companies reinforce this diversity and equality of opportunity through the adhesion to and promotion of policies of positive discrimination towards less-favoured races and the economic re-balancing of special groups. Equality between men and women is a reality among the companies within the Group, where there is identical treatment and a salary policy that makes no distinction between the sexes, race, or belief and that is based on performance and professional experience, in accordance with the principles of merit and competence.
198

The number of professionals in the Acerinox Group (including the subsidiaries of the Group) amounts to 6,742 out of which 832 are women. Furthermore, Columbus has once again collaborated with the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) programme, reaching a high compliance level. The BBBEE seeks to encourage South African black community access to positions of responsibility and to promote their social advancement. Acerinox has improved the classi cation of this concept year-on-year after creating a Transformation Committee that reports to the Management Committee. Columbus Stainless improved its rating in the main criteria evaluated by the report, such as management positions, skills development or social-economic development. e. Local Communities The Group collaborates socially in the geographical areas where its production plants are located and helps in the execution and maintenance of health, cultural, sports and environmental projects. At Acerinox Europa, the Donations Committee of the plant (financed by both the Group and the workers) allocates
nancial aid to NGOs, associations to ght against diseases and the most disadvantaged in the area. NAS nances sports, student and cultural projects of very diverse nature. Columbus maintains a campaign to ght against AIDS, whose virus is very present in the country, with a wide range of measures for the containment and prevention of infections. Bahru carries out charitable initiatives as well as promotion of equality through activities, especially during Ramadan.

The Acerinox Group rmly believes that the greatest bene t that a company can provide to society is through the responsible performance of its operations, which results in the creation of value and payment to suppliers, shareholders and employees. Likewise the Company contributes to public expenditure through the current scal system and to the Social Security systems in the countries where it operates. Thus it is worth pointing out the following contributions towards the development of society, apart from the charity work that the Group has carried out.
Shareholder remuneration ·  124,230,394.35
Social Security ·  70,890,778
Salaries ·  299,718,718
Tax paid ·  171,318,164
In essence, these obligations constitute the greatest and most committed demonstration of a corporation's social responsibility.
Trading companies, as well as individuals, must collaborate in a responsible fashion in order to uphold the level of well-being and the social protection systems of the societies where they are based.
The Acerinox Group strives each year to make effective use of their human, technical or nancial resources to help disadvantaged groups and contribute to the development of society.
Indeed, their collaboration goes beyond the thousands of employees and payrolls directly or indirectly generated in the course of their business making every effort to form part of the local community in which the companies of the group operate.
Acerinox participates academically or collaborates directly with more than 30 universities spread out over four continents. It is present in courses, cathedra's, trainings and master's degrees related to engineering, steelmaking, business management and other elds of strategic interest and, through them, promotes the value of its activity and its sector by attracting talent. Cedinox (Association for the Development and Promotion of Stainless Steel) offered last year 22 presentations in 19 technical universities. They were attended by 1,415 students and had 33 teachers.
f. Alliances and external initiatives Acerinox is actively involved with associations and civil society through collaborating with different social, cultural, and sports organisations.
An example of this very active collaboration is when Bernardo Velázquez, Chief Executive Of cer of Acerinox, S.A. was appointed Chairman of the Steelworks Companies' Union (Unión de Empresas Siderúgicas - UNESID).

4.3 Compliance Ethical behaviour is one of the cornerstones of the Group and is regulated by the Conduct Code and Good Practice applicable to all professionals in the Company, including all those professionals who work for them, or on their behalf, in any country. This Code is a source of inspiration for standards of honesty, rectitude, integrity, and transparency always present in our business. Today, not only does a company have to comply with that required by Law in the countries in which they operate but also has to consider the ethical side of all their decisions. In this context, Acerinox has implemented internal policies and standards that must be complied with in order to become more transparent, trustworthy, and ethically better every day. The Company has adopted procedures to ensure that its actions adapt to the different legal systems and to the highest possible internal operational standards. The Group has the necessary mechanisms in place so that any incidents of discrimination that may occur are dealt with through the Whistle-Blowing Complaints Committee supervised by the Audit Committee. The solutions that this Committee develops aim to defend workers' rights and are committed to compliance with the Code of Conduct and Good Practices. During 2017, there were no cases of discrimination in the Group reported. The Company is committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Taking into account the activity of the Group, the controls established and its geographic environment, it is not considered that the Company is exposed to non-compliance of Human Rights risks. Moreover, the hiring standards comply with the criteria of the global organization, which are more rigorous than the current legislation in force in each country.

4.4 Fighting against corruption The Conduct Code and Good Practices of the companies of the Group forms the basis of the regulatory compliance and prevention of illegal acts system, according to the directives set forth in the Prevention Plan. The Code makes a clear distinction between the axiomatic principles of the system, the basic standards whose noncompliance thereof could be subject to reproach by the jurisdiction and the procedural and adjective provisions that above all should be monitored and enforced. The way in which the Code is implemented is through training and awareness sessions so that the Company is certain that it is understood and, in the case of non-compliance thereof, be is enforced through disciplinary actions. However, should an irregularity occur despite the controls and measures in place, there is an institutionalised complaints channel known as "whistle blowing" that enables the Governing Bodies of the Group to know the illicit act so that they can adopt the appropriate measures while keeping the identity of the Whistle Blower con dential. At the same time, Acerinox Group strictly complies with internal procedures and policies, and prevents corruption through:
· Internal procedures that prevent any unusual or unexplained decisions. · Instructions about receivables and payments are performed through prestigious credit-worthy entities in
countries not classi ed as tax havens, being absolutely forbidden cash payments or the use of payment methods different to those authorised. · The Code of Good Tax Practices to which Acerinox is affiliated and the Tax Policy of the Group determine that all the Group companies located in territories with the consideration of tax havens are dedicated exclusively to the commercialization of stainless steel and there will be no undue ow of rents to these companies. · Acerinox does not finance any political party, nor any association or foundation that is sponsored, recommended or used by political parties. · Favours, perks, gifts, or handouts by individuals or entities that hold or have held a business relationship with Acerinox Group are strictly prohibited as well as exercising any secondary activity without authorisation or prior permission.
