BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 3

Introduction
Dear reader,
Beter Bed presented a mixed picture in 2017. Just as in 2016, performance varied sharply from country to country, with lower revenue in particularly the German-speaking countries. This stands in sharp contrast to the higher revenues once again achieved in the Benelux. The group as a whole realised higher revenue with slightly decreasing margins and higher expenses, which resulted in lower operating profit in 2017 compared to the previous year. The success of Beter Bed in the Benelux and Beddenreus in the Netherlands continued unabated in the year under review. Revenues and margins improved and the focus on retail marketing, with customer satisfaction as the spearhead, continued to bear fruit. This is due both to successful realisation of the 'From Good to Great' strategy and continuing favourable macroeconomic developments. There also continues to be high demand on the housing market, a high level of consumer confidence and high propensity to buy. Matratzen Concord in Germany was able to largely reverse the negative trend of a decreasing number of visitors in the first six months of 2017. This trend could not, however, be sustained in the second six months of 2017, with mainly supplier-related problems in the sector and the related media attention leading to a sharp decrease in the number of visitors in the fourth quarter. The latter was primarily the case in October and November, which is in line with the experiences in the market. Matratzen Concord saw the number of visitors recover in December. Matratzen Concord Austria posted lower revenue in 2017 after benefiting in 2016 from the increase in the number of stores owing to the acquisition of BettenMax. In contrast, Matratzen Concord Switzerland benefited from the weak comparative basis from 2016 when changes to the exchange rate negatively affected average consumers' buying power. Both formats were impacted by the same supplier-related problems as their German counterpart in the fourth quarter of 2017. El Gigante del Colchón in Spain continued to achieve growth and higher revenue. Sängjätten in Sweden benefited from the successful introduction of the group's (private label) brand portfolio, which has already been successful in the Benelux for a number of years. In the course of 2017 it became clear that it was unlikely that Literie Concorde in France could be operated on a sufficiently profitable basis in the short to medium term. It was consequently decided to discontinue the activities of this format.
4 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Margins on goods decreased slightly at the group level in 2017 due primarily to the increasing share of box springs and textiles in the revenue. This decrease could be compensated partially by improvements in the terms and conditions and changes to the range. Product innovation and the implementation of price increases also had a positive effect on margins.
Expenses rose in the Benelux primarily due to the further expansion of the omnichannel and customer satisfaction activities and heightened logistics activities as a result of the substantial increase in revenue. In Germany, the further professionalisation of the organisation (connected with the reorganisation expenses) in general and the expansion of the omnichannel organisation in particular led to higher expenses. The marketing activities were also increased and the amortisation costs rose due to the renovation of the stores in Germany.
Economic developments in the countries in which Beter Bed Holding operates remain favourable for 2018. We are consequently optimistic for the Benelux due to the numerous positive developments in 2017 and the plans and initiatives for 2018. Matratzen Concord will start with a new management in 2018. In addition, the majority of the stores has been refurbished and the introduction of box springs has been finalised. Furthermore the new web shop platform has been implemented and a new and expanded marketing campaign has been launched, which will enable Matratzen Concord to once again attract consumers to its stores and web shops.
Beter Bed Holding continues to pursue in full the objectives set out in the strategic plan `From Good to Great 2016-2020', with the primary focus remaining on maximising customer satisfaction within an omnichannel environment. A reassessment of the CSR objectives was carried out within the parameters of the strategy in 2017.
CEO Ton Anbeek announced on 14 July 2017 that he would be leaving Beter Bed Holding to continue his career elsewhere. He stepped down as CEO on 31 October 2017, bringing to an end a seven-year period in which he worked on building the success of Beter Bed Holding with outstanding dedication and commitment. The arrival of our new CEO, John Kruijssen, on 1 April 2018 means our Management Board is once again complete and that we can together work on further developing the group.
Despite the difficult circumstances in Germany, the company succeeded in 2017 in making progress on further developing the organisation and strengthening its position in the different markets. We are extremely grateful to our employees for the contribution they have made both individually and as part of a team.
Yours sincerely,
Bart Koops, CFO
Uden, The Netherlands, 1 March 2018

Dividend policy
Beter Bed Holding N.V.'s dividend policy focuses on maximising shareholder returns whilst maintaining a healthy capital position. Subject to conditions, the company's objective is to pay out at least 50% of the realised net profit to the shareholders. This payment will be made in the form of an interim dividend following publication of the third-quarter figures and a final dividend following the approval of the dividend proposal by the Annual General Meeting. This system makes it possible to spread out payment of the dividend evenly over the year. The payment of the dividend may never result in the company's solvency falling below 30% on any publication date. Furthermore, the net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA ratio may not exceed two.

Vision and Mission
Vision
Beter Bed Holding is an active player in the retail and wholesale market for beds and mattresses. Europe, in the broadest sense, is its playing field. All retail formats have, to a greater or lesser degree, a `value for money' positioning, regardless of the market in which the individual chain operates. The group strives for market leadership in all countries in which it is active. The essence of its vision statement can be formulated as follows:
In every country in which we operate, we intend to become the market leader in the value-for-money segment of the bed and mattress market, in a socially responsible manner.
Mission
Beter Bed Holding's raison d'être and drivers can be expressed in the following mission statement:
Each day, there is nothing that inspires and motivates us more than ensuring that all our customers can sleep soundly and comfortably at
an affordable price: `Hard at work on a good night's rest'
16 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Objectives 2016-2020
Customer satisfaction
In all markets in which the company operates, Beter Bed Holding aims to optimally serve its customers with strong, contemporary formats in an omnichannel environment. Customers' wishes are leading in this respect and customer satisfaction serves as the benchmark. The retail formats are also positioned and expanded in such a way as to ensure that growth opportunities are optimally utilised. Market share is increased and market leadership is strengthened in this way.
Net profit
Increasing net profit regardless of market conditions. Beter Bed Holding aims to achieve above-average growth and expansion of its leading market position, even in challenging market conditions. Customer satisfaction leading to like-for-like growth, expansion within existing formats, improving margins, and controlled development of expenses are the key drivers of net profit.
Balance sheet structure
Maintaining a strong balance sheet with solvency of at least 30% and a net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA ratio of no greater than two. The dividend policy is applied and net working capital and leverage are managed within those frameworks, taking account of the required liquidity.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Beter Bed Holding and its subsidiaries treat the interests of their stakeholders in a conscious and conscientious manner. Sound entrepreneurship and respect for people and planet go together in this regard.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 17

Strategy
The company's objectives, which are based on the themes of customer satisfaction, net profit, balance sheet structure and CSR, will be achieved through:
Retail marketing
The positioning of all Beter Bed Holding formats is continually being refined. All the formats provide topquality products and advice for the lowest or best price. Based on these strengths, strong emphasis is placed on increasing customer satisfaction, like-for-like growth and substantial growth of the online revenue. The ultimate aim is to increase the market share in an omnichannel retail environment. The various formats face different challenges with respect to achieving this aim.
The Benelux must primarily improve the transaction strength (higher conversion and higher order values). In contrast, the principle challenge for the other countries is to increase attractiveness (attract more visitors). Each format has developed its own strategy and plan for achieving this aim.
Innovation will be a key driver for growth in revenue. This pertains to both product and brand innovation within each format's private brand strategy. In order to achieve this, the development strength within Purchasing will be enhanced and the cooperation with strategic suppliers will be intensified.
With a view to bringing about a further increase in customer satisfaction, substantial investments in training and educating our sales and logistics employees will be made.
The marketing department will make a large contribution to the development of the various formats through consistent communications in the stores and brochures and on the websites. Marketing spending will be increased in the years ahead in order to support the positioning and innovative character of the different formats.
E-commerce
The e-commerce or omnichannel proposition will be further refined in all countries. The customer journey will be fully facilitated, which means customers will receive optimum service during all moments of contact. Online-only ranges will also be developed and the range of bed textiles will be expanded. Marketing spending for e-commerce support will be increased substantially. The objective of all of the above is to gain a fair share in online revenue.
In order to give shape to the omnichannel strategy, the management teams in the Netherlands and Germany have been strengthened and responsibility for E-commerce has been placed at the Management Board level. In addition, the E-commerce departments will be expanded further to include the required functional specialists needed to build and operate state-of-the-art web shops (including partnerships in the Benelux with parties including Wehkamp.nl, Bol.com and Fonq.nl, and in the German-speaking countries with potential parties such as Amazon.de).
Expansion
In addition to the like-for-like growth, expansion will contribute to revenue performance. Within the Benelux, this will primarily take place in Belgium. With respect to Matratzen Concord, expansion is foreseen through opening and improving the location of stores in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Expansion in the number of stores is also foreseen in Spain and Sweden. This expansion will take place under strict conditions concerning the investment per store, the operating expenses and flexible rental periods.
18 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Alongside the expansion within the existing formats, the company will expressly look for opportunities for further organic growth or acquisitions in existing and new countries.
Purchasing and sales
Purchasing has been allocated a key role in implementing the strategy. In addition to the product innovation stated above, Purchasing has the following objectives:
· improving margins; · developing the online range; · optimising delivery times; · having fewer (but more strategic) suppliers with fewer SKUs; · developing additional ranges; · creating maximum synergy among the various formats in the different countries.
Sales will ensure an optimum omnichannel customer experience supported by advice tools, configurators, Net Promoter Scores and customer reviews.
Back office (HR, Finance, Logistics and IT)
The Back office functions are expected to work in a sales-, service- and customer-focussed manner. Customer satisfaction, further professionalisation and proactiveness are the key terms in this regard.
HR has a leading role to play in this respect. It must focus on a range of matters including inflow, throughflow and outflow, management development, attracting young talent (especially for Sales), permanent training and creating a customer-centred, high-performance KPI and team culture. The HR function is fulfilled at the Management Board level in order to achieve this.
The Finance function will develop into a Business Support function, whereby the analysis capacity will be expanded by means including implementing a modern business information warehouse and applying function-specific dashboards.
Logistics must focus on acceleration within the chain. Customer wishes such as same-day delivery and next-day delivery will become leading and drop shipments will be facilitated when desired. The optimal logistics infrastructure will be determined on a per-country basis given the nature of the formats.
New front ends have been or will be developed within the IT function based on a robust backbone (SAP) that offer maximum flexibility with respect to customer wishes. The front ends involve both the cash register systems in the stores and the e-commerce platforms. Explicit attention is also paid to information security in general and cyber security in particular.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Beter Bed Holding's awareness of its corporate social responsibility is borne out in its existing compliance reports, ongoing stakeholder dialogue and structured approach to CSR that is embedded in the organisation. It is Beter Bed Holding's ambition to further develop initiatives in the field of promoting the circular economy from within the sector and in dialogue with strategic suppliers.

Value drivers
The aforementioned strategic approach leads to value creation in six areas that can be grouped as follows:

BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 21

General
Each country put Beter Bed Holding's adopted strategy `From Good to Great 2016-2020' into practice with varying success in 2017. The central themes of this strategy are: customer satisfaction, retail marketing, further development of the omnichannel proposition, innovation and acceleration in the logistics chain. Beter Bed Holding's strategy centres on achieving long-term value creation by seeking to gain market leadership in all the countries in which the group operates. It seeks to achieve this position based on the omnichannel principle, a focus on service, a strong private label brand portfolio and up-to-date and modern stores. Beter Bed Benelux and Beddenreus continued the positive development of 2016 and saw their revenue, margin and operating profit improve further. This success could be achieved thanks to a range of commercial activities coupled with a substantial acceleration in the logistics chain. The organisation has now been completely aligned to the demands placed on a modern omnichannel retailer and as a result can now expressly lay claim to its position in the bedroom furniture sector. Beter Bed has succeeded in further developing its leading position in the highly competitive Dutch market. A high level of consumer confidence and effective realisation of the strategy went hand in hand in this endeavour. The further development of the online proposition also contributes to long-term value creation. The revenue of Beter Bed Benelux rose by 8.8%, with revenue increasing further in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Revenue also rose at Beddenreus in the Netherlands. The group continues to seek expansion of the number of Beter Bed stores in Belgium and Beddenreus stores in the Netherlands.
The formats in Germany, Austria and Switzerland had a difficult year in 2017. While in Germany a limited recovery of revenue compared to the trend in 2016 could be seen in the first six months of 2017, revenue in the third and fourth quarter trailed far behind, primarily due to a lower number of visitors. A similar pattern could be discerned in Austria and Switzerland. The demand for box springs is growing in the German bed and mattress market. In addition, the share of the pure players at the bottom of the market is increasing. In 2017, Matratzen Concord took steps forward in both areas en route to gaining a fair share. The decrease in the fourth quarter was due primarily to supplier-related problems and the ensuing negative publicity that dissuaded consumers from deciding to buy a mattress. Nonetheless a number of key steps towards making the format more contemporary were taken. In addition to the refurbishment of many of the stores, these steps included the implementation of the new e-commerce platform and the introduction of box springs. The management was also changed at multiple positions. Spain was able to sustain the growth in revenue, despite the number of stores being slightly lower at yearend. Revenue rose by 5.6%.

The development of the Sängjätten format in Sweden acquired in 2016 was extremely positive, which resulted in a positive contribution margin in the last quarter of 2017. The conversion of the format into the Beter Bed format and the introduction of its own brand portfolio formed the foundation for this success.

The conclusion had to be reached in the summer of 2017 that profitable operation of the format Literie Concorde in the south of France in the short to medium term was unlikely. It was consequently decided to close the format and the closure was effected at the end of 2017.

In summary, the group realised revenue of  416.4 million in 2017, which represents an increase of  5.9 million (1.5%) compared to the previous year. Growth in revenue in comparable stores amounted to -0.4%.

Gross profit decreased slightly and amounted to 57.5% (2016: 57.8%). The decrease was caused primarily by the increased share of box springs and bed textiles in the revenue. This was countered by improved purchasing conditions, an adjustment in the sales mix and range and product innovation.

Total expenses rose with  14.0 million to  225.1 million. This increase was caused mainly by higher marketing costs, the expansion of the omnichannel organisation and the further professionalisation of the different back office departments. In addition, the amortisation costs increased chiefly due to investments in the refurbishment of stores in Germany. Increased revenue at Beter Bed Benelux was accompanied by higher logistics expenses. An amount of approximately  2 million has also been appropriated for restructuring.

Operating profit decreased by 44.6% to  14.4 million in 2017 (2016:  26.0 million). EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased to 6.6% (2016: 9.1%). Net profit amounted to  9.5 million (2016:  19.0 million); a decrease of 49.9%.

The number of stores decreased by 18 in 2017. The group operated 1,188 stores in seven countries at the end of 2017.

Investment, financing and cash flow
Total investments amounted to  21.4 million in 2017. A total of  14.8 million was invested in new and existing stores. The largest investments were made in the refurbishment of Matratzen Concord. Substantial investments were also again made in the omnichannel infrastructure (e-commerce and web shops). Cash flow1 amounted to  22.6 million in 2017 (2016:  30.5 million). Solvency remained high, but decreased to 44.8% (2016: 53.5%). This decrease is mainly attributable to the use of the facilities within the cash pool structure. The net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA ratio at year-end 2017 was zero (2016: zero). Net working capital2 decreased in 2017. The change compared with 2016 has several effects and is due, on the one hand, to the higher inventory value resulting from the addition of box springs to the range in the German-speaking countries and the receivables in connection with prepaid corporate tax. On the other hand, amounts owed to credit institutions increased due to the use of the facilities within the cash pool structure.

Matratzen Concord is a pan-European `Fach Discount' format that primarily
serves the replacement market and focuses on the sales of principally mattresses, bed bases, box springs and bed textiles. The chain has 999 stores in three countries (Germany, Switzerland and Austria). While the stores have traditionally been located near consumers in and around city centres, they are increasingly also located in retail parks.

Revenue in comparable stores decreased at Matratzen Concord by 6.0%, while total revenue in 2017 decreased by 5.4%. This decrease occurred primarily in Germany. German consumers' lower propensity to buy led to a lower number of visitors.

The range was restructured in the second half of 2017, which created space in the stores that could be used to offer a wider selection of box springs. In addition, the process of refurbishing the stores was continued in Germany. All of the stores in Germany will be modernised within three years, with the refurbishment of the last stores being completed in 2018. The same modernisation is taking place in Austria and Switzerland.

46 stores were opened and 51 stores were closed in the year under review.

Beter Bed is a full-service format of bedroom furniture showrooms in the mid-
segment of the market with an outstanding price-quality ratio. Customers order the items in the store or on the website and most of these items are then delivered to and assembled at the customers' homes free of charge. The stores are located in the Benelux, preferably on furniture boulevards or in the vicinity of other furniture stores.

Revenue of Beter Bed increased by 8.8% to  133.3 million in 2017. This means Beter Bed achieved the highest revenue in its history for the second successive year. The increase is partly due to the continuing high level of consumer confidence and the favourable housing market. Continuous adjustments to the ranges and the high level of service in the stores also contribute to the growth in revenue.

The share of online sales grew further in 2017 to 7.8% of the revenue (2016: 6.2%).

The order intake in comparable stores in 2017 rose by 7.2%.

Sängjätten is a full-service format in the Swedish market, comparable to Beter
Bed. There are a total of 25 stores, of which 9 are franchises. The company was added to the group in June 2016. The new Sängjätten look and feel was introduced in late 2016, followed by the introduction of the new ranges from the second quarter of 2017. This resulted in a significant rise in the order intake.

Staff, organisation and culture
The group had 2,849 employees (FTE) on 31 December 2017. There were 2,765 employees at year-end 2016. The increase was caused primarily by higher staffing levels on the store floor, growth in the number of logistics employees and the expansion of the omnichannel activities of the group as a whole. The quality of the services and our employees' focus on service largely determine the success of the retail formats of Beter Bed Holding N.V. A customer-friendly approach, a first-time-right and a KPI-focussed attitude, and speed of delivery are crucial for our reputation and the results. This is why we continuously focus attention on the training and development of our employees in both the commercial and operational fields. The 360° assessments were elaborated further in the Benelux in 2017.
Both the logistics and the sales staff are given training with respect to product knowledge and behaviour. In addition, employees are given scope to complete individual training and educational programs when necessary. Management positions are filled with local employees in all countries. The company furthermore aims to have a larger number of women in management positions. The organisation had twelve women (39%) in top management positions on 31 December 2017 (2016: 29%). The Management Board expressly attaches importance to open and honest communications within the group. The 'tone at the top' is crucial in this regard. The organisation's current structure guarantees short lines of communication and transparency. The core values of the culture have been established in the Code of Conduct and can be described by the terms customer focus (internal and external), experimentation, ownership and collaboration.

Risk management and risks
General
The following general control measures are in place at Beter Bed Holding to manage risks:
The organisation applies a matrix that describes the risks, their financial and other impact, the probability of their occurrence, the control measures and the actions to be taken. This matrix is updated and discussed in the Audit Committee twice a year and the key points are reported to the Supervisory Board. The risks are classified in the categories Financial, Operational, Board and Management, Legal, Social, Information and Tax.
Risk appetite
Beter Bed Holding operates in the European bed and mattress segment. Beter Bed Holding's risk appetite is based on a strong operating cash flow, a healthy balance sheet without external financing and carefully considered financial management. Although the company's daily operations involve taking risks, Beter Bed Holding adopts a carefully considered and balanced approach to those risks. More information about the risk appetite in the various categories defined by Beter Bed Holding is explained below.
The opportunities and threats identified by Beter Bed Holding for the group as a whole and for the individual companies in economic, strategic and commercial terms are determined in the annual budget cycle. The budget drawn up by the Management Board of Beter Bed Holding is discussed with and approved by the Supervisory Board.
All business units (in the Netherlands and abroad) report monthly to the group on the financial results (revenue, margin, expenses and operating profit) and the financial position. The Beter Bed Holding Management Board discusses these reports in monthly meetings held with the various management teams, an approach which provides for direct monitoring of the various operations. Endeavours are made to achieve a high degree of uniformity in the various reports to enhance their effectiveness. The administrative and accounting records of the operations are maintained in the SAP (ERP) environment implemented in the organisation several years ago.
In addition, Beter Bed Holding established an Internal Audit Function (IAF) in 2017. The IAF has been placed externally and is therefore an independent and objective body with the aim of contributing to the further professionalisation of the entire organisation (in accordance with the Internal Audit Charter). From a risk management perspective, the IAF is qualified as the `3rd line of defence', after the `1st line of defence' of operational management and the `2nd line of defence' of the internal control structure. The IAF's findings are discussed with the Management Board and the Audit Committee.
The external auditor (4th line of defence) reviews the Administrative Organisation and Internal Control (AO/IC) during the annual audit of the financial statements. The audit findings are discussed by the external auditor with both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, also in the absence of the Management Board.
The principal risks for Beter Bed Holding and its affiliated operating companies are as follows:
The financial strategic risks relate to the failure to achieve revenue due to the entry of new competitors, the introduction of new products, brands and revenue models. The positioning, product range, pricing and service level of the formats in their own markets are continually refined on the basis of frequent, extensive and thorough consumer research, market information and competition analysis. The company also follows a proactive omnichannel strategy that has been elaborated and tailored to consumers' wishes in each country. This strategy allocates an express role to the stores in combination with own online webshops and strategic web partners whenever possible. The risks section of the general notes to the financial statements gives further information on a number of specific financial risks associated with the normal business operations.
The company identifies operational strategic risks with respect to supplier side consolidation, which could jeopardise margins and supplies. To mitigate this risk, internal agreements are in place on the maximum share in revenue that an individual supplier can have within the group. In addition, regular consultation takes
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 29

place at the highest executive level (Management Board) with the principal suppliers. The organisation also applies an extensive system of supplier management, enabling continuous monitoring of the performance of individual suppliers and early identification of indications of potential problems at suppliers. Moreover, the product range sourced from any one supplier can in principle be transferred to another supplier within an acceptable timeframe.
Legal strategic risks relate to non-compliance with legislation and regulations in various fields, including product liability, consumer protection and reporting. These risks are mitigated by systematically requesting advice from experts with relevant knowledge, including legal specialists, tax specialists, accountants and competent authorities. In addition, audits are conducted at regular intervals. Beter Bed Holding is not prepared to take risks relating to non-compliance with legislation and regulations.
The social strategic risks primarily relate to damage to the company's image and reputation as a result of defective products or irresponsible actions in a broader sense. It should be noted that the formats do not manufacture products for the product range. Control systems ensure that products meet the applicable requirements. Beter Bed Holding accepts no risks with regard to product safety. In October 2017, the group was confronted with potentially contaminated mattresses, because the supplier had supplied a contaminated raw material to foam manufacturers. Deliveries of foam mattresses were discontinued immediately after this became known. It was established within a few days, on the basis of our own review and reviews in the industry, that no contamination had occurred and deliveries were resumed. Consumers' safety had not been at risk at any time. Following this event, further measures were taken in order to prevent the risk of any reoccurrence of this type of incident. The organisation has adopted codes of conduct in various fields to ensure responsible conduct. The corporate culture, in which integrity and ethical business conduct are core values, makes a significant contribution to the mitigation of risks. The company has also adopted a whistleblowers policy.
The main operational risks relate to the availability of information systems that support the primary processes and the availability of the logistics facilities. These risks are managed by designing the IT architecture in a manner that ensures that the cash register systems can operate standalone and that backups can continually be made of the data of all back-office systems, in turn ensuring that the external IT infrastructure will be operational within the timeframe required for continuity purposes in the event of an emergency. System integrity is monitored by applying a clear release policy and strict change management procedures. Beter Bed Holding continued to take measures in 2017 in cooperation with external parties to further optimise digital security in the broadest sense of the term and lift it to a higher level. The logistics risks relate largely to the situation in the Netherlands, where three distribution centres (DCs) are in operation. Should an emergency occur at one of these DCs then the other two can serve as backups. Each DC also has an individual business continuity plan.
Tax
Beter Bed Holding has adopted explicit tax principles. The main principles are that Beter Bed Holding maintains an open relationship with the tax authorities in the countries in which it operates, agrees on tax rulings solely to confirm the correct interpretation (and application) of the tax rules and tax laws and does not adopt (abnormal) tax arrangements focused exclusively on tax avoidance. Beter Bed Holding has signed a compliance agreement with the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration within the context of `horizontal monitoring'. This ensures that any tax issues are discussed openly and on the basis of full transparency. The Management Board reports twice a year on relevant tax issues to the Audit Committee.
Independent auditor's report
The independent auditor assesses the internal control measures relating to the financial statements to the extent required for an efficient and effective audit approach. He reports his findings to the Management Board and to the Supervisory Board in his management letter and his independent auditor's report, respectively.
30 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

In control statement
Based on the aforementioned and considering the limitations inevitably associated with any internal risk management and control systems, the company's systems provide the Management Board with a reasonable degree of security with regard to financial risks that the financial statements do not contain any material misstatements and that the annual report gives a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet date and the developments during the year under review. These risk management and control systems operated properly during the year under review, and there are no indications that this situation should change in the current year. With regard to the other risks, the company maintains a risk management and control system adapted to the company's size, which also performed adequately during the year under review.
True and fair view statement
The Management Board declares that, to the best of its knowledge, the annual report provides a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet date, developments during the financial year of Beter Bed Holding N.V. and those of its affiliates whose details are included in its financial statements, along with expected developments, with regard to which special attention is paid to investments and conditions on which developments of revenue and profitability depend, unless this conflicts with vital interests. The Management Board also declares that, to the best of its knowledge, the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position at the balance sheet date and the result of Beter Bed Holding N.V. and the companies included in the consolidation of the financial year.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 31

Expectations and outlook
Economic developments remain favourable in the countries in which the group operates. As was the case in 2017, the outlook for the current financial year will be determined primarily by the degree to which revenue recovers in the German-speaking markets (more than 50% of the group revenue). The introduction of a renewed marketing campaign, the availability of a sufficient range of box springs and the completion of the refurbishment of the stores must enable Matratzen Concord to strengthen its position in the market under new management. The group continues to pursue in full the objectives set out in the strategic plan `From Good to Great 2016-2020', with the primary focus being on maximising customer satisfaction within an omnichannel environment. As part of this undertaking, the group furthermore aims to gain market leadership in the various markets through mainly like-for-like growth in revenue and expansion.

CSR
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 33

The CSR year in brief
Every company that operates at the heart of society must embrace the social responsibility that comes with this. Sustainable enterprise is a key component in this respect. It is, after all, the only way to remain successful in the longer term. Beter Bed Holding accepts its responsibility and has initiated a continuous improvement process in this field. Several key steps were once again taken in 2017.
Reassessment of the CSR strategy
The CSR strategy has, first of all, been reassessed this year. Important directional talks have been held with internal and external stakeholders to ensure that Beter Bed Holding can respond to market demands with the correct focus ­ both now and in the future. This has resulted in a clear commitment in terms of the mission, namely to approach CSR from the perspective of strategic opportunities. Based on this ambition, five themes have been defined on the basis of which Beter Bed Holding can make the difference through its activities: circular economy, safety and quality of products and services, responsible chain management, energy & CO2 emissions, and safe working conditions. Challenging targets have been formulated for each theme for the period up to 2020. This reassessment provides greater direction and ensures that CSR becomes a more solidly embedded part of the group's daily activities in all the countries in which it operates. Beter Bed Holding has furthermore expressly sought to enter into a dialogue with a number of strategic stakeholders regarding the circular economy, a field in which collaboration is vital in order to achieve results. Together with these stakeholders, Beter Bed Holding has translated the CSR ambition into the circular practice: where are the opportunities and dilemmas that ensue from matters including the current technical limitations relating to the recyclability of foam for example. This dialogue has produced valuable insights and points for attention with respect to the 2020 objectives. Human rights and fighting bribery and corruption are two other social themes the group can help address. By consciously choosing suppliers and requiring them to sign the Code of Conduct, the group obligates its suppliers to adhere to international treaties and conventions on working conditions. Beter Bed Holding works mostly with suppliers from Europe and as a result limits the risk of incidents. In addition, 98% of the suppliers have signed the Code of Conduct and Beter Bed Holding has entered into partnership with two of its strategic suppliers in order to develop more sustainable products. Safety also continues to be a key spearhead. Employees must be able to count on a safe working environment and customers must be able to rely on good-quality and safe products. One of the concrete activities for the coming year involves increasing the number of tests: in addition to distribution centres, the air quality of the stores will now also be tested.
34 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Work to be done
At the same time the group is realistic and wishes to manage its expectations. It is, for example, fully aware that the circular economy presents both large opportunities and large challenges. There is a far-reaching social necessity to bring about a circular economy given that the majority of the mattresses currently end up in the incinerator. This situation is not tenable in the long term. There is already a well-functioning return system in the Netherlands in this field. But it is only the beginning. Great gains in the field of sustainability can theoretically be achieved through better recycling of materials at the end of the lifespan. Tapping into these opportunities demands above all a chain approach: only in partnership with suppliers and customers will it be possible to achieve workable and effective recycling solutions. Beter Bed Holding is consequently focussing on collaborating with partners and customers because this provides the best opportunities for results. It is also clear that it is vital to have new technologies and materials in this area in order to be able to make a real difference. This field of research is still in its infancy. In short, Beter Bed Holding is also ambitious in this area, but realises that a great deal of work still has to be done and that results will not be achieved automatically. It will be a matter of working hard and persevering in the years to come, together with partners and customers.
About Beter Bed for a Better Future
Beter Bed for a Better Future, Beter Bed Holding's CSR report, provides insight into (the execution of) Beter Bed Holding's CSR strategy in 2017. The CSR report 2017 is supplementary to the annual report 2017 and will be available soon. This is the seventh time Beter Bed Holding presents this report on its activities and progress in the field of CSR. It has been drawn up in line with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) at the `Core' level and the internal reporting criteria for CSR information. The emphasis of the report is on the reassessed strategy and the ensuing five most material themes.

Report of the Supervisory Board

General

The Supervisory Board is comprised of Ms E.A. de Groot, Mr D.R. Goeminne (Chairman), Mr A.J.L. Slippens (Vice Chairman) and Mr W.T.C. van der Vis. The CVs of the members of the Supervisory Board are included in the section Supervisory Board (see page 44). In accordance with the provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, all Supervisory Board members are independent.
Supervisory Directors are appointed for a period running up to and including the day of the first Annual General Meeting that is held four years after their appointment. Supervisory Directors retire periodically in accordance with a schedule to be drawn up by the Supervisory Board. The following retirement by rotation schedule applies:

Supervisory Director
D.R. Goeminne A.J.L. Slippens E.A. de Groot W.T.C. van der Vis

Appointed
1 May 2010 1 May 2010 1 May 2011 25 April 2013

Reappointed

Retirement/reappointment
AGM 2018 AGM 2018 AGM 2019 AGM 2021

In the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2017, the Chairman informed the shareholders that Mr Slippens would be retiring in 2018. In accordance with best practice provision 2.2.2 of the revised Corporate Governance Code, it will be proposed in the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2018 to extend the term of office of Mr Goeminne as Chairman by one year up to and including the Annual General Meeting in 2019. This is aimed at preventing a simultaneous departure of both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board and thus the loss of knowledge and experience and also at supporting the transition to a new composition of the Supervisory Board.
2017 Results
The Supervisory Board closely followed the revenue and profit development of Beter Bed Holding and recognises that the group's performance in 2017 was mixed. While the consistent execution of the policy defined by the Management Board and the focus on revenue growth and profitability are certainly gratifying, the Supervisory Board shares the moderate satisfaction of the Management Board with regard to the disappointing results in Germany, despite the focus and the measures taken.
Despite the lower results for 2017, the Supervisory Board is convinced that the company should continue its strategy `From Good to Great 2016-2020', aimed at long-term value creation, without change.

Financial statements, discharge, dividend
The financial statements were prepared by the Management Board and the auditor, PwC Accountants, subsequently issued an unqualified auditor's report on these financial statements. That report is included in the independent auditor's report in the section additional details (see page 88). The Supervisory Board discussed the financial statements in detail in the presence of the Management Board and PwC Accountants.
Following the publication of the trading update on the third quarter results on 3 November 2017, the company decided to distribute an interim dividend of  0.34 per share (2016:  0.34). In accordance with the Management Board's proposal, we propose distributing a final dividend of  0.03 per share. This means that 86% of the profit for 2017 will be distributed in the form of shareholder dividends. This is in line with the dividend policy (see page 11), which was approved in the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2005.

46 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

The Supervisory Board has approved the 2017 financial statements and proposes to adopt these at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2018, and to discharge the members of the Management Board in respect of their management and the members of the Supervisory Board in respect of their supervision with regard to the financial year 2017.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board aims for an adequate balance of knowledge of, and experience with, the company's operations. The Board has established two committees: the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The full Board fulfils the role of the Selection and Appointment Committee in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
At the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2017, Mr W.T.C. van der Vis has been reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board for a period of four years.

Activities of the Supervisory Board

In 2017 the Supervisory Board was once again closely involved in developments related to Beter Bed Holding and its subsidiaries. During the reporting year, the Chairman frequently liaised with the Management Board in preparation for the meetings between the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. The former met with the latter on five occasions. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also held six conference calls with the Management Board.
The table below shows the attendance (expressed as a percentage) of Supervisory Board members at Supervisory Board and Committee meetings. If members of the Supervisory Board were unable to attend a meeting in person, they provided comments and views on the meeting documents in writing before the meetings.

50% (1/2)

Remuneration Committee
100% (1/1) 100% (1/1) 100% (1/1) 100% (1/1)

The Supervisory Board received regular, timely, detailed verbal and written updates from the Management Board throughout the year. Extensive attention was paid to the operating results of the various formats and the group, as well as to progress on the strategic themes.
The company met with the external auditor on two occasions. In March 2017, the results for 2016 and the audit findings were discussed. The half-year results were discussed in August 2017, along with the results of the audit of the half-year results conducted by the external auditor.
The budget for 2018, which was discussed during the meeting of 14 December 2017, sets out the company's operational and financial objectives, along with the policy that should ensure that these objectives are achieved, all in line with and within the framework of our strategic plan `From Good to Great 2016-2020'.

BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 47

The performance of the Supervisory Board and that of the individual Supervisory Directors, the relationship with the Management Board and the composition of the Supervisory Board were discussed and assessed in closed meetings, partly with the assistance of an external adviser. The performance of the Management Board and the remuneration policy were naturally on the agenda as well. Consultation also took place in individual interviews on the performance of the members of the Management Board.
After an explanation provided by its Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board discussed the update of the risk assessment process with the Management Board. We believe that the procedures related to risk analysis, risk management, risk control and audits by the external auditor with respect to the AO/IC (Administrative Organisation and Internal Control) provide sufficient certainty for the in-control statement relating to the performance of the risk control and risk management system.
After Ton Anbeek announced on 14 July 2017 that he intended to leave the company, the Supervisory Board started a diligent process to fill the vacancy that had arisen. At the beginning of 2018, agreement was reached with the new CEO to be appointed, John Kruijssen. We are grateful to Ton Anbeek for his contribution over the past years to the development of the Beter Bed Holding Group.
Audit Committee
During the financial year, the Audit Committee was comprised of Ms De Groot (Chairman), Mr Goeminne and Mr van der Vis. The composition of the Audit Committee is in accordance with the provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, with Ms De Groot serving as financial expert.
The Audit Committee's duty is to advise the Supervisory Board on, and assist it in, its responsibility to monitor the company's compliance with reporting and corporate governance requirements.
The Audit Committee convened on two occasions in the past financial year. On both occasions, the Audit Committee met with the external auditor in the absence of the Management Board.
The Audit Committee extensively discussed the financial statements and the Report of the Management Board, and the half-year results and associated management letters including the key audit subjects with the Management Board and the external auditor, PwC Accountants. The Audit Committee also focused on the audit plan for 2017, compliance with previous recommendations, tax issues, liquidity and funding, and the company's risk management and control system.
The Audit Committee was also involved in developing the Internal Audit Function.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of Ms De Groot, Mr Slippens (Chairman), Mr Goeminne and Mr van der Vis. In 2017, one committee meeting and frequent consultations were held in connection with filling the vacancy arising after the CEO's departure.
The Remuneration Committee also discussed the performance and remuneration of the top twenty managers of the organisation with the Management Board.
The Remuneration report (see page 50) follows the Report of the Supervisory Board.
48 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Diversity
There are currently no women on the Statutory Management Board of the company and one of the four seats on the Supervisory Board is occupied by a woman. Beter Bed Holding N.V. consequently does not officially fulfil the requirement for a balanced distribution of seats (30% male/female). Selection of members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board will continue to be based on broad experience, background, skills, knowledge and insights, with due regard for the importance of a balanced composition.
Conclusion
The Supervisory Board recognises the broad interests the company represents and understands its responsibility towards all the company's stakeholders: shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and financiers. We wish, within this context, to refer you to the www.beterbedholding.com, website that contains up-to-date information on the company. The company once again achieved the desired progress in the different countries in multiple areas in 2017. The disappointing developments in primarily Germany were largely the consequence of external circumstances and do not detract from the many good developments and achievements realised by the group as a whole in the year under review. The Supervisory Board is grateful to everyone within the Beter Bed organisation for their contribution to realising the set objectives. Uden, The Netherlands, 1 March 2018 D.R. Goeminne, Chairman A.J.L. Slippens, Vice Chairman E.A. de Groot W.T.C. van der Vis

Remuneration report
Remuneration policy
The current remuneration policy was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2016. The complete text is published on the company's website as part of the Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Committee advises the Supervisory Board when it is formulating the remuneration policy and determining the individual remuneration of the Management Board.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to recruit, motivate and retain qualified persons as Management Board members, who enable Beter Bed Holding N.V. to achieve its strategic and operational objectives.
The remuneration policy is enterprising in nature, but it also must be reasonably in ratio with the other members of management, all of the foregoing taking into consideration the social context, corporate governance structure and the interests of the stakeholders in Beter Bed Holding.
Remuneration of the Management Board
The remuneration of the Management Board consist of the following competitive elements:
· a fixed salary; · a pension scheme; · a variable remuneration; · options on shares; · other employment benefits.
Fixed salary
The market terms are determined on the basis of knowledge, insight and experience of the individual Supervisory Directors by means of a benchmark that the Supervisory Board conducts once every three years with a reference group of approximately ten comparable companies. That assessment was carried out most recently at the beginning of 2015, after which the fixed salaries of both Management Board members were adjusted.
Pension scheme
The pension scheme is a defined contribution scheme. The percentage of the contribution is determined by investigating the situation at other companies, in which context the members of the Supervisory Board are involved, in addition to the maximum permitted for tax purposes in that respect. The CEO and the CFO received a contribution for 2017 equal to 30% and 25% of the fixed salary, respectively.
Variable remuneration
The variable remuneration is largely profit-related and is partially at the Supervisory Board's discretion.
In 2017, the maximum variable remuneration for the CEO was equal to 60% of the gross fixed annual salary (split into 50% for quantitative objectives and 50% for qualitative objectives). For the CFO the maximum variable remuneration was equal to 50% of the gross fixed annual salary (split into 40% for quantitative objectives and 60% for qualitative objectives). Owing to the CEO's departure during the financial year, no variable remuneration was awarded to him.
The following table summarises the quantitative (including variables such as revenue and EBITDA) and qualitative objectives that are aligned to the strategy and the results achieved by the CFO, which shows that the quantitative objectives have not been realised and that the qualitative objectives have been realised partially.

The individual objectives stipulate clear strategic trigger points, which cannot be explained in more detail for competitiveness reasons.

The budget is set at a level that the Supervisory Board considers challenging but achievable at the time at which it is set. The evaluation of the extent to which the quantitative objectives have been met has taken into consideration ­ and will take into consideration in the future ­ the extent to which there can be deemed to be normal market conditions and the extent to which there has been sound business practice.

1 Number of options granted multiplied by the value of the option at the time of granting. 2 Up to and including 31 October 2017. 3 The options granted to Mr Anbeek lapsed in connection with his departure.

Options on shares
Options on shares are used as a long-term incentive. Options are granted not only to the Management
Board, but also to the management teams in the various formats. For the share option scheme rules, see the
company's corporate website.

If option rights under options series as from 2016 are exercised, the members of the Management Board must use the proceeds obtained in doing so to purchase shares in Beter Bed Holding. Those shares are subsequently required to be held for a period of four years by the members of the Management Board. This ensures that a portion of the variable remuneration is linked to long-term value creation.

`Change of control' clauses have not been included in the Management Board members' contracts. However, when a bid for all the shares in the company is declared unconditional all options may be exercised, regardless of the status of the realisation of the objectives.

The Remuneration Committee used the scenario analyses referred to in Corporate Governance Code best practice 3.4.1 when it formulated the remuneration policy and determined the individual remuneration.

General notes
General
Beter Bed Holding N.V. operates in the European bedroom furnishings market. Its activities include retail trade through the chains Beter Bed, Matratzen Concord, El Gigante del Colchón, Beddenreus and Sängjätten. Beter Bed Holding is also active in the field of developing and wholesaling branded products in the bedroom furnishing sector via its subsidiary DBC International. The registered office of Beter Bed Holding N.V. is in Uden, the Netherlands.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for land, which is carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union and their interpretations as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Unless expressly stated otherwise, the amounts stated in these notes refer to the consolidated figures. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros and all amounts have been rounded off to thousands ( 000), unless stated otherwise.
The 2017 consolidated financial statements of Beter Bed Holding N.V. have been prepared by the Management Board and discussed in the meeting of the Supervisory Board on 1 March 2018. These financial statements are still to be adopted by the shareholders. The adoption of the financial statements has been placed on the agenda of the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2018.
Applications of new standards
A number of new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards entered into effect in 2017. The new standards, amendments and interpretations of relevance to the company had no impact on the company's capital and results.
The following standards and interpretations were issued on the date of publication of the financial statements, but were not yet effective for the 2017 financial statements. Only those standards and interpretations are listed below that Beter Bed Holding N.V. reasonably expects to have an impact on the disclosures, the financial position or the results of the company upon future application. Beter Bed Holding intends to apply these standards and interpretations as soon as they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments, effective 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 is the new reporting standard for financial instruments, replacing IAS 39 `Financial instruments'. The transition from incurred credit losses to expected credit losses for determining the provision for receivables is entirely new. However, given the non-material size of that provision, this new standard has no significant impact on Beter Bed Holding's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, effective 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 is the new reporting standard for revenue from contracts with customers, replacing IAS 18 `Revenue'. Beter Bed Holding has analysed the five steps in IFRS 15, which are: identify the contract, identify the 'performance obligation' in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the 'performance obligations' in the contract and recognise revenue. This revealed that this new standard has no significant impact on Beter Bed Holding's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases, effective 1 January 2019
IFRS 16 is the new reporting standard for leases, replacing IAS 17 `Leases'. In its 2016 annual report, the company already stated that this new standard will have a significant impact on Beter Bed Holding. The group has nearly 1,200 stores in various European countries. Nearly all these stores are rented. The notes for the rental agreements are currently enclosed under Note 20 `Commitments not included in the balance sheet'. The monthly rental costs are currently recognised by debiting to the profit and loss account on the basis of the prevailing lease standard.
60 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Pursuant to IFRS 16, these rental and lease agreements shall need to be recognised in the balance sheet. The future `right of use' will then be capitalised and the future lease obligation will be recognised. In addition, there will be a shift from the operating lease costs to the amortisation and interest costs.
In 2016, Beter Bed Holding performed an initial analysis of the impact of IFRS 16 on the group. This revealed that the balance sheet total will increase significantly by an amount dependent on the assumptions for the discount rate and the renewal period for the rental agreements. This is also applicable to EBITDA. IFRS 16 will, in conclusion, inevitably have a great impact on a number of ratios, including solvency. The covenants with credit institutions are not impacted, however, given the fact that the ratios concerned are calculated excluding the impact of IFRS 16. At the present time, Beter Bed Holding has not yet finalised its choice in connection with the transition options and the options for practical implementation and other matters offered by the standard. Accordingly, no insight can be provided yet into the actual impact entailed by the adoption of IFRS 16.

Principles of consolidation

New group companies are included in the consolidation at the time at which the company can exercise effective control over the company, because Beter Bed Holding holds the majority of voting rights or can control the financial and operating activities in another manner. The information is accounted for on the basis of full consolidation using uniform accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised gains on intercompany transactions, are eliminated in full.

The following companies are involved in the consolidation of Beter Bed Holding N.V. and its participating interests:

Principles for the translation of foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros. The euro is the functional currency of Beter Bed Holding N.V. and the reporting currency of the group. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date; profit and loss account items are translated at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. The resultant exchange differences are credited or debited to the profit and loss account. Exchange differences in the financial statements of foreign group companies included in the consolidation are taken directly to equity through other comprehensive income. The results and assets and liabilities of consolidated foreign participating interests are translated into euros at the average exchange rate per month and the closing rate for the year under review. On the disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred accumulated amount recognised in equity for the foreign entity concerned is taken through the profit and loss account.
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment other than land are valued at the cost of purchase or construction less straight-line depreciation based on the expected economic life or lower recoverable amount. Land is carried at fair value on the basis of periodic valuations by an outside expert. Any revaluations are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income, with a provision for deferred taxation being formed at the same time. Land and items of property, plant and equipment in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognised in the event of disposal or if no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gains or losses arising from its derecognition (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds on disposal and the carrying amount of the asset) are taken through the profit and loss account for the year in which the asset is derecognised. The residual value of the asset, its useful life and valuation methods are reviewed and if necessary adapted at the end of the financial year.
Leases
The determination whether an arrangement forms or contains a lease is based on the substance of the agreement and requires an assessment to determine whether the execution of the agreement is dependent upon the use of a certain asset or certain assets and whether the agreement gives the right to actually use the asset. Beter Bed Holding only has operating leases. Operational lease payments are recorded as expenses in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Intangible assets
Initial measurement of intangible assets is at cost. The cost of intangible assets obtained through an acquisition is equal to the fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, valuation is at cost minus accumulated amortisation and impairments. Development costs are capitalised when they are likely to generate future economic benefits.
Intangible assets are assessed in order to determine whether they have a finite or indefinite useful life.
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful life and tested for impairment if there are indications that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are assessed in any event at the end of each period under review. Any changes in the expected useful life or expected pattern of the future economic benefits from the asset are recognised by means of a change in the amortisation period or method and must be treated as a change in accounting estimate. Amortisation charges on intangible assets with a finite useful life are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any gains or losses arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the profit and loss account when the asset is derecognised.
62 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Impairment of assets
The company reviews at each reporting date whether there are indications that an asset has been impaired. If there is any such indication or if the annual impairment testing of an asset is required, the company estimates the asset's recoverable amount.
An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of an asset or the cash-generating unit (after deduction of the selling costs) and the value in use. If an asset's carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is deemed to have been impaired and its value is written down to the recoverable amount. When assessing the value in use, the present value of the estimated future cash flows is determined, applying a discount rate before tax that takes into account the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset.
An assessment is made on each reporting date of whether there are indications that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods no longer exists or has decreased. If there is any such indication, the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss recognised in prior periods is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. In that case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. This increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years. Any such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset (or, if applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised if the group is no longer entitled to the cash flows from that asset or if substantially all risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred or ­ if substantially all risks and rewards of the asset have not been transferred ­ the entity has transferred `control' of the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation has been discharged or cancelled or has expired. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender, under substantially different terms, or if substantial modifications are made to the terms of the existing liability, the replacement or modification is accounted for by recognising the new liability in the balance sheet and derecognising the original liability. The difference between the relevant carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
Taxation
Tax liabilities for current or prior years are valued at the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The amount is calculated on the basis of the tax rates set by law and enacted tax laws.
A provision is formed for deferred tax liabilities based on the temporary differences on the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and the carrying amount in these financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. The deferred tax liabilities are valued at nominal value.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for available tax loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and the carrying amount in these financial statements. They are valued at nominal value. Deferred tax assets arising from future tax loss carryforwards are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on applicable tax rates and enacted tax laws.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost consists of the final purchase price less purchase discounts and plus additional direct costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs for settling the sale. Unrealised intercompany gains and losses are eliminated from the inventory valuation.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 63

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet consist of bank balances and cash.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised for legal or constructive obligations existing at the balance sheet date for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required and whose amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are carried at the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, which is the nominal amount of the expenditure expected to be required, unless stated otherwise.
Other assets and liabilities
Other assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost. Where necessary an allowance for doubtful debts is applied for receivables. The notes contain a specification of any differences between the market value of these assets and liabilities and the amounts stated in the balance sheet.
Determination of the result
Revenue
The revenue is understood as the proceeds of the sale of goods and services to third parties less discounts and similar rebates, and sales taxes. Sales are recognised as revenue when the goods are delivered to consumers and other customers and all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.
Cost of sales
This comprises the cost of the goods and services included in sales, after deduction of any payment discounts and purchase bonuses received, increased by directly attributable purchase and supply costs.
Expenses
The costs are determined in accordance with the aforementioned accounting policies, and are allocated to the financial year to which they relate. Interest is recognised as an expense in the period to which it relates.
Pensions
A variety of pension schemes are in use within the company. In the Netherlands, the majority of the employees participate in the Wonen Industrial Pension Fund, which is included in the Detailhandel Industrial Pension Fund with effect from 1 January 2018. This is an average pay scheme with a maximum pension accrual on the income for social security contributions. This arrangement is currently considered a `defined benefit' scheme. This pension fund is not, however, able at present to provide data that enable a strict application of IAS 19. The principal reason for this is that the company's share in the Wonen Industrial Pension Fund cannot be sufficiently reliably determined. Consequently this pension scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Virtually all other pension schemes are defined contribution schemes. The contributions paid to the Wonen Industrial Pension Fund and to insurers respectively are recognised as expenses in the year to which they relate. There are no company-specific pension schemes in the other countries.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation are calculated using the straight-line method based on the expected economic life. Additions in the year under review are depreciated and amortised from the date of purchase.
64 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. The `cash and cash equivalents' item stated in the cash flow statement can be defined as cash and cash equivalents less current bank overdrafts, inasmuch as this does not relate to the current component of non-current loans. Current bank overdrafts are an integral part of cash flow management.
Share-based transactions
Members of the Management Board and a few other employees of the company receive remuneration in the form of payment transactions based on shares, whereby these employees provide certain services in return for capital instruments (transactions settled in equity instruments). The costs of the transactions settled with employees in equity instruments are valued at the fair value on the date of grant. Fair value is determined on the basis of a combined model of Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations. Performance conditions are taken into account when determining the value of the transactions settled in equity instruments.
The costs of the transactions settled in equity instruments are recognised, together with an equal increase in equity, in the period in which the conditions relating to the performance and/or services are met, ending on the date on which the employees concerned become fully entitled to the grant (the date upon which it vests). The accumulated costs for transactions settled in equity instruments on the reporting date reflect the degree to which the vesting period has expired and also reflects the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. The amount that is charged to the profit and loss account for a certain period reflects the movements in the accumulated expense.
Risks
The main financial risk consists in failing to achieve the budgeted revenue and therefore the planned cash margins, mainly as a result of changes in consumer behaviour in response to changing economic conditions. Revenues and order intakes for each format are reported on a daily basis to manage this risk. On a weekly basis, data on realised margins, numbers of visitors, conversion and average order values are added to them and commented on.
On the basis of the analyses, adjustments are made in the utilisation of marketing tools, including pricing policy and the use of advertising. In addition, cost budgets are periodically reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Economic and macroeconomic information from the market, including sector-specific reports, is also utilised.
Currency risks, arising mainly from purchases in dollars, are not hedged. A 5% change in the average dollar exchange rate would, on the basis of the purchasing volumes in the financial year, produce an effect of approximately  97 (2016:  108) on the operating profit (EBIT) if sales prices remain the same. There are virtually no financial instruments in foreign currencies. The currency risks owing to the presence and/or transactions in Sweden and Switzerland and the potential volatility of the Swedish krona and the Swiss franc are considered to be limited due to the fact that the majority of goods purchases takes place in euros.
Owing to the current capital structure of the company, interest rate risk is very limited. The effect on the result of a change (increase or decrease) in the interest rate of 50 basis points would be  0.1 million before taxation (2016:  0.0 million), on the basis of the use of the credit facilities at year-end 2017. The carrying amount of the financial liabilities is virtually equal to the fair value.
Credit risk is limited to the wholesale operations and trade receivables under bonus agreements. No specific measures are required for this, in addition to standard credit control. The fair value of receivables is equal to their carrying amount. The maximum credit risk equals the carrying amount of the receivables.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 65

Liquidity risk is not very significant, owing to the nature of the company's operations and financial position. A description of the available credit facilities can be found in the chapter current liabilities (see page 73). For an explanation of the other risks, please refer to the related section of the Report of the Management Board (see page 29).
Capital management
The company has a target solvency (equity/total assets) of at least 30% in accordance with the dividend policy. In addition, the ratio of net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA must not exceed two. The item inventories is by far the most important in the working capital. Targets have been defined for this for each format. These variables are included in the weekly reports.
Solvency at year-end 2017 was 44.8% (2016: 53.5%). The net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA ratio was zero in 2017 (2016: zero).
EBITDA is defined as operating profit or loss before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets and before disposals of non-current assets.
Information by segment
Various operating segments are identified within the group as they are reviewed by the decision-makers within the entity. These operating segments independently earn revenues and incur expenses. The principal operating segments are comparable in each of the following respects:
· Nature of the products and services The operating segments primarily sell mattresses, bedroom furnishings (including box springs), bed bases and bed textiles. The operating segments also provide the home delivery service.
· Customers for the products and services The operating segments sell direct to consumers, focusing specifically on customers in the 'value for money' segment.
· Distribution channels for the products and services The operating segments generate their revenue in stores (the offline retail channel) and also have a web shop (online retail channel). Online revenue compared with total revenue is similar for the operating segments.
· Economic characteristics The operating segments have similar economic characteristics, e.g. in terms of revenue, gross profit and inventory turnover rate.
In view of the comparability of the above characteristics, the operating segments are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
Seasonal pattern
Owing to the seasonal pattern in consumer demand, revenue and net profit are usually lower in the second and third quarter than in the first and fourth quarter.
66 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Estimates
In preparing the financial statements, the Management Board is required to exercise judgment, make assumptions and estimates that affect the application of the accounting standards and the valuation of the recognised assets and liabilities and income and expenses. Owing to those judgments, assumptions and estimates, the actual valuation may subsequently differ materially from the reported valuation. The actual timing of the utilisation of amounts in provisions is uncertain when determining them beforehand. Judgments, assumptions and estimates are continually reviewed and are based on historical experience and other factors, including future expectations. These future expectations are based on reasonable expectations concerning the relevant factors affecting the financial statement item concerned. Adjustments of estimates are recognised in the period in which those adjustments are made and, where relevant, in the future periods concerned. Where significant estimates are made when drawing up the financial statements, an explanation is provided in the notes for each item in question. Accounting estimates were applied mainly for the measurement of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and the provision for onerous contracts and taxation.
Accounting for acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for on the basis of the purchase accounting method. From the date of acquisition, the results and the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company are included in the consolidated financial statements. The date of acquisition is the date on which control can be exercised in the company concerned. The purchase price comprises the cash amount or equivalent thereof that has been agreed to acquire the acquiree plus any directly attributable costs. Any amount by which the purchase price exceeds the net amount of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is capitalised as goodwill under intangible assets. If the purchase price is lower than the net amount of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, the difference (badwill) is credited to profit or loss.

The cumulative revaluation relates to the land in Uden, Nieuw-Vennep and Hoogeveen, as well as the value of the land forming part of the retail properties owned. These retail properties are located in Elst, Den Helder and Uden. The land forming part of the retail properties was valued on 30 June 2015 and the land forming part of the distribution centres in Uden and Hoogeveen was valued on 25 November 2015, both by an independent valuer. The valuation of the distribution centre in Nieuw-Vennep was performed on 25 July 2014 by an independent valuer. The valuations have been performed using the rental value capitalisation method.

A further explanation of the investments is enclosed in the report of the Management Board (see page 24).

The intangible assets are comprised of the acquired 'Sängjätten' brand name, licenses and software.

3. Financial assets

The financial assets consist on the one hand of non-current receivables of  526 (2016:  660) and on the other of deferred tax assets of  2,353 (2016:  1,217).
The non-current receivables relate to guarantee deposits for the rental agreements for stores. These are classified under financial assets due to the non-current nature of these receivables.
The deferred tax assets at year-end can be broken down as follows:

Tax loss carryforwards Difference tax and financial reporting valuation (in)tangible assets Difference tax and financial reporting valuation pension Difference tax and financial reporting valuation stock

2016

2,353

1,217

At year-end 2017, a tax credit of  1,772 (2016:  643) for future loss carry-forwards was recognised under financial assets. This relates to losses available for carry-forward in Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. As Beter Bed Holding expects, on the basis of the currently available information, to be able to set off these tax losses within five years, they have been capitalised in full.

An amount of  10,790 (2016:  10,797) in loss carry-forwards has not been recognised. Beter Bed Holding's policy is that tax losses available for carry-forward are capitalised only if reasonable possibilities for set-off are expected within five years on the basis of a substantiated forecast of the results for tax purposes. Setoff of these losses is insufficiently probable on the basis of the currently available information.

The tax losses available for carry-forward expire as follows:

4. Inventories

This comprises inventories held in stores of  58,914 (2016:  55,239) and inventories held in warehouses of

 6,783 (2016:  6,645). The write-down for possible obsolescence included in this item can be broken down

as follows:

2017

1,633 1,595 (1,354)

Balance at 31 December

1,215

1,874

In view of the amount of the gross profit, the turnover rate and the fact these products are generally not dependent on trends to any significant extent, the risk of obsolescence of inventories is comparatively low. The prices realised in sales of obsolescent inventories usually exceed their cost.

The provision for obsolescent inventories relates mainly of returned goods that cannot be returned to suppliers, damaged products, showroom products, products that will no longer be carried and products with a very low turnover. The direct net realisable value is estimated for each of these categories. If the carrying amount exceeds the direct net realisable value, the inventories are written down by this difference.

The total carrying amount of inventories for which there is a risk of obsolescence is  5,492 (2016:  6,203). The direct net realisable value of these inventories is  4,277 (2016:  4,329). Therefore the percentage of inventories for which there is a risk of obsolescence compared with total inventories was 8.2% (2016: 9.7%).

70 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

5. Receivables
All receivables fall due within less than one year and are carried at amortised cost, which is equal to the nominal value. Sales in stores and deliveries are settled in cash. Receivables relate mainly to receivables due from wholesale customers and trade receivables arising from agreed bonuses.
Provisions are recognised for individual receivables if there are objective indications that the probability of uncollectibility for them exceeds 50%. This assessment is performed on the basis of past experience and other relevant information, such as bankruptcy of the debtor concerned.
A provision of  13 (2016:  25) has been recognised for receivables due from wholesalers. This is 1.7% (2016: 5.9%) of the overdue receivables.

A proposal will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting to distribute a final dividend in cash of  0.03 per share. The total dividend for 2017 will therefore amount to  0.37 per share (2016:  0.74).

8. Provisions

A provision for onerous contracts has been formed for the long-term leases relating to discontinued format operations. This provision is based on the rent and the remaining term, taking account of a subletting probability and a mark-up for service costs.

The deferred tax liabilities relate mainly to the differences between the valuation of inventories and fixed assets in the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences are long-term in nature.
The deferred tax liabilities at year-end can be broken down as follows:

10. Current liabilities
To fund the group the company has current account facilities totalling  42.3 million at its disposal. Furthermore, facilities totalling  6.4 million are available for providing guarantees.
For the purpose of the current account facilities, the company and its subsidiaries have undertaken not to encumber their assets with any security rights without the prior consent of the lenders.
These current account facilities include two committed facilities in the amount of  10.0 million each which will expire on 10 July 2020 and 15 July 2020 respectively. No security has been provided for the committed facilities. The main conditions of the credit facilities are a minimum solvency of 25% and a maximum interest-bearing debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.5.
At the end of the year under review, an amount of  17.5 million (2016:  0.0 million) was used under the current account facilities. These facilities were also used for providing bank guarantees for the purpose of rental payments amounting to  0.5 million (2016:  0.6 million). Of the facilities available specifically to provide guarantees, a total of  6.7 million was used at year-end 2017 (2016:  6.3 million).

14. Option program

The options are long-term in nature and can be exercised providing that the profit target has been met. With effect from 2013, the costs of the option program are calculated using a combined model of Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations. An overview of the details of the options granted and still outstanding, as well as the values employed in the Black & Scholes model, is provided below.
With effect from the options series 2013, in the first three years after the award of the options granted, 33.3% of the options will vest annually if the `Total Shareholder Return' (TSR = share price gains plus dividend distributed) of Beter Bed Holding N.V. exceeds the `Total Shareholder Return of the AScX', based on the year of the award. In addition, the employee is required to continue to be employed by the company for three years. Options can only be exercised if these conditions are met after three years.
The design of the option program was modified in 2016. The options are vested in full three years after their award (in contrast to 33.3% vested annually). In addition, the TSR of Beter Bed Holding achieved after three years is compared with the TSR of nine relevant national and international listed companies that jointly form a peer group. The Management Board of Beter Bed Holding N.V. is under the obligation to retain shares awarded under the option program for a period of at least four years. The former option policy/option agreement continues to prevail for options already awarded until 2016.
From the 2013 series, this means that the calculation will be based on three different Black & Scholes values, risk-free interest rates and volatility percentages. The ranges of those percentages are set out in the table below.

In 2017, 263,667 options expired, as a number of employees holding options left the company before the expiration dates. In addition, a total of 133,650 options expired in 2017 due to the expiry of their term. Furthermore, a portion of the options expired because the vesting conditions were not satisfied. The series concerned are the series 2014 part III and 2015 part II. Lastly, 128,500 new options were granted in 2017. See the summary of options series outstanding (see page 13).

The effective tax rate rose to 32.1% in 2017 (2016: 26.5%). This increase was mainly attributable to the fact that a number of tax facilities in Germany can no longer be used and loss carry-forwards that had (provisionally) not been capitalised.

The item tax in the profit and loss account comprises the following:

The variable remuneration relates to the year under which it is classified and is recognised in the expenses of that year. The maximum variable remuneration for the CEO for 2017 is equal to 60% of the gross fixed annual salary (split into 50% for quantitative targets and 50% for qualitative targets). The maximum variable remuneration for the CFO is 50% of the gross fixed annual salary (split into 40% for quantitative targets and 60% for qualitative targets). However, owing to the CEO's departure during the financial year, no variable remuneration was awarded to him. For detailed information, see the remuneration report (see page 50).

The costs listed under `Employee stock options' represent the amount accounted for in the profit and loss account for that year.

At the end of the financial year, the CFO held 1,500 shares in Beter Bed Holding. He holds 10,666 exercisable options for shares in Beter Bed Holding at 31 December 2017.

The net profit of  9.5 million divided by the average number of outstanding shares totalling 21,955,562 equates to earnings per share of  0.43 in 2017 (2016:  0.87). Due to the options series outstanding, the number of shares used for the calculation of diluted earnings per share is equal to 21,955,855. This results in diluted earnings per share of  0.43 (2016:  0.86).

20. Commitments not included in the balance sheet

General
The registered office of Beter Bed Holding N.V. is Linie 27, Uden, the Netherlands. The financial statements have been compiled on the basis of Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted for use in the European Union and applied to the consolidated financial statements. The participating interests in group companies are valued at the net asset value calculated in accordance with Beter Bed Holding N.V.'s policies. When a participating interest has a negative equity the sequence is as follows: first, the valuation of the participating interest is reduced, after which a write-down is applied to the amounts owed by this participating interest insofar as these are an increase of the net investment in the participating interest, and then a provision is formed. Beter Bed Holding N.V. had an average number of 7 employees (FTE) in 2017 (2016: 7). The company financial statements are presented in euros and all amounts are rounded to thousands ( 000) unless stated otherwise. The note on executive remuneration (see page 78) is included in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet and profit and loss account. The fees charged for the audit of the financial statements and other non-audit services by the auditor PwC Accountants are also disclosed in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet and profit and loss account.

We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2017 of Beter Bed Holding N.V., Uden (`the Company'). The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of Beter Bed Holding N.V. and its subsidiaries (together: `the Group') and the company financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements comprise: · the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2017; · the following statements for 2017: the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated

The basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
88 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Independence We are independent of Beter Bed Holding N.V. in accordance with the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities, the `Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the `Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO ­ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the `Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA ­ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).
Our audit approach
Overview and context Beter Bed Holding N.V. is a European retail- and wholesale organisation in the bedroom furnishing sector. The group is comprised of several components and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section `The scope of our group audit'. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the company, being net revenue and inventories.
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the management board made important judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In the annual report, the entity has disclosed the accounting estimates and most important sources of estimation uncertainty in the section estimates. As a retail organisation the inventory makes up 42% of the balance sheet of Beter Bed Holding N.V. The valuation of this inventory contains an important estimation uncertainty which is partly based on management's judgment. Given this uncertainty and the absolute volume of the inventory, we consider the existence and the valuation of the inventory a key audit matter. This has been further disclosed in the section `key audit matters' of this auditor's report.
Beter Bed Holding N.V. has strategic objectives related to increasing customer satisfaction and growth of both net revenue and market share. To reach these objectives investments are made in online solutions, shop formulas and extension of shops in different countries. Based on this, stakeholders are mainly referring to the development in net revenue. As a result, we have identified accuracy of net revenue as the second key audit matter in our audit. Furthermore, we have used net revenue as base in determining materiality as is further disclosed in the relevant section.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the management board that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit. Therefore, we have included specialists in the areas of IT, income tax and employee benefits in our team.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 89

The outline of our audit approach was as follows:
Materiality · Overall materiality:  4,000,000. Audit scope · We conducted audit work on the financial reporting
of 3 entities. We have audited the full financial statements of Beter Bed B.V., BBH Services GmbH & Co. KG (consolidated) and Matratzen Concord GmbH (Vienna, Austria) as part of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Beter Bed Holding N.V. · We have visited the auditor who has performed audit procedures on the German and Austrian entities. · Audit coverage: 89% of consolidated net revenue, 88% of total assets and 73% of profit before taxation. Key audit matters · Accuracy of net revenue · Existence and valuation of inventories.
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'. Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.
90 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Overall group materiality Basis for determining materiality Rationale for benchmark applied
Component materiality

 4,000,000 (2016:  4,000,000).
We used our professional judgment to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment we used 1% of total net revenue.
We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis we believe that net revenue is an important metric for the financial performance of the company. Profit before taxation is not considered an appropriate benchmark, because this would result in large fluctuations in overall group materiality year over year.
To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between  3,500,000 and  4,000,000.

We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above  100,000 (2016:  100,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
The scope of our group audit
Beter Bed Holding N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Beter Bed Holding N.V.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at the component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.
The group audit primarily focussed on the significant components: Beter Bed B.V. and BBH Services GmbH & Co. KG (consolidated). At the level of BBH Services GmbH & Co. KG a subconsolidation is made for the German entities.

BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 91

We have performed an audit of the complete financial information for these two entities as these entities are individually significant considering their financial volumes. Additionally, three entities have been included in the group scope to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the consolidated financial statements. Matratzen Concord GmbH (Vienna, Austria) was subjected to audit of their complete financial information and Beter Beheer B.V. and Beter Bed Holding N.V. were subjected to specific risk-focussed audit procedures.
In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:

Net revenue Total assets Profit before tax

89% 88% 73%

None of the remaining components represented more than 5% of total group net revenue or total group assets. For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components.

The group audit team performed audit procedures on the components Beter Bed B.V., Beter Beheer B.V. and Beter Bed Holding N.V. As the auditor of the group we used the work performed by the component auditor of BBH Services GmbH & Co. KG (consolidated) and Matratzen Concord GmbH (Vienna, Austria).

Where the work was performed by the component auditor, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Before the start of their audit procedures we have shared detailed instructions including the results of our risk analysis which were performed as part of our audit of the financial statements of Beter Bed Holding N.V. The group audit team has assessed all reports related to the audit approach and findings of the component auditor. For both entities the group audit team reviewed specific relevant workpapers in the audit file of the component auditor. Furthermore, the group engagement team visited the component team multiple times throughout the year and for example attended the year end clearance meeting on site in Germany for BBH Services GmbH & Co. KG (consolidated) and Matratzen Concord GmbH (Vienna, Austria).

The group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items such as share based payments, income tax and related disclosures and the company statements are audited by the group engagement team at the head office.

By performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters that were identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comments or observations we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.

92 BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017

The identified key audit matters are consistent with prior year.

Key audit matter
Accuracy of net revenue
Note 12 to the consolidated profit and loss account in the financial statements
Net revenue is an important measure used to evaluate the performance of the company (also refer to the materiality). There is a risk that the net revenue is presented for amounts higher than what has been actually generated by the company, therefore this is a key audit matter. Net revenue is accounted for when the sales transactions have been completed. This is when goods are delivered to the customer and all economic risks for Beter Bed have been transferred as a result. Net revenue is generated through store sales as well as online sales. Delivery has been completed when goods are paid and transferred to the customer in store or when goods are paid by the customer and delivered on location. These transactions are mainly processed automatically through IT.

How our audit addressed the matter
We have assessed and evaluated the design and existence of the most important (automated) internal controls implemented by management which are designed to ensure accurate processing of net revenue transactions.
Amongst these controls are controls related to the interface between the cash-register and the financial administration, 4-eye principle which is applied when making price changes, the reconciliation of payments made to drivers with bank receipts and the financial administration and the automated `three-way match'. Additionally, we took notice of the internal representation(s) where local management takes responsibility for the reported net revenue and determined that these do not contain exceptional items which could give further direction to the audit of the net revenue.
Furthermore, we have established the operating effectiveness of the internal controls considered relevant for our audit.

The most important internal control procedure for the accuracy of the net revenue is the automated threeway-match in SAP. We assessed the Information Technology General Controls (ITGC) as a basis to be able to reperform the three-way-match between sales order-delivery-invoice. With this, we have made the reconciliation to the sales order, packing slip and invoice. No material findings were noted.

Furthermore, we have performed risk assessment analytical procedures on realized net revenue through detailed store comparison.

The results of our controls testing, reperformance of the three-way-match and analytical procedures have been the basis for the nature and scoping of the additional test of details, which mainly consisted of testing individual sales orders by reconciling them to proof of delivery (on location) or release. Additionally, we performed substantive procedures on credit notes sent throughout the year and after balance sheet date to ensure appropriate net revenue per year-end. These audit procedures have not resulted in material findings to be communicated

BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 93

Key audit matter
Existence and valuation of inventories
Note 4 to the consolidated balance sheet in the financial statements
Total inventories of  66 million represent 42% of total assets of Beter Bed Holding N.V. These inventories mainly consist of inventories in the stores and inventories kept at the distribution centers. Given the absolute amount of the inventory we consider the existence of these inventories to be a key audit matter.
Valuation of the inventories is at cost or at lower net realizable value. Valuation at cost includes different components including allocated supplier bonuses. The allocation of supplier bonuses and the assessment of revaluation of inventories to net realizable value is partly based on management estimates. As a result of this estimation and related uncertainty, we also consider the valuation of inventory to be a key audit matter of our audit.

How our audit addressed the matter
Our audit procedures to test the existence of the inventories mainly consist of testing the relevant internal control procedures, specifically by testing the inventory cycle counts that are periodically performed by management and the automated recording of sales transactions (three-way-match).
Throughout the year, we have attended a selection of inventory cycle counts in stores and in the distribution centers, to validate counts performed by the company. We compared our count results with the results of the counts by Beter Bed representatives and noted no material differences.
In addition, we have performed a sample on the inventory for several distribution centers per year end. We compared our count results with the inventory administration and noted no material differences.
To validate the valuation of inventories, we performed test of details on historical costs, actual margins and valuation of obsolete inventories.

Historical costs were tested through sampling reconciling historical costs with the original purchase invoice. Hereby, no material differences were noted.

We assessed whether there were inventories which were sold with a (consistent) negative margin by evaluating recent sales invoices from January and February 2018 to validate management's assessment and decision whether inventories should or should not be provided for. Furthermore, we analysed the inventory turnaround and compared that to management's estimates on obsolete inventories. These audit procedures have not resulted in findings to be communicated.

For the allocation of supplier bonuses to the valuation of inventories at cost we recalculated the supplier bonuses per supplier based on supporting contracts. The settled supplier bonuses were tested by reconciling them to the bank statements. Furthermore, we have validated mathematical accuracy of the allocation to inventories as per year end. Finally, we have established that for main suppliers not included in the calculation no supplier bonuses were received and were therefore rightfully excluded from the calculation of the inventory valuation. We have established that in 2018 no credit notes were received for this. Based on the audit procedures performed, we have not found any material findings.

Report on the other information included in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: · Report of the management board; · CSR; · Corporate governance; · Report of the supervisory board; and · Remuneration report.
Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information: · is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; · contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.
By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The management board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the directors' report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Our appointment
We were appointed as auditors of Beter Bed Holding N.V. on 19 May 2015 by the supervisory board following the passing of a resolution by the shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 19 May 2015 and the appointment has been renewed annually by shareholders representing a total period of uninterrupted engagement appointment of 3 years.
No prohibited non-audit services
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5 (1) of the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities.
Services rendered
The services, in addition to the audit, that we have provided to the company and its controlled entities, for the period to which our statutory audit relates, are disclosed in note 21 to the financial statements.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial statements
The management board is responsible for: · the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for · such internal control as the management board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the management board is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the management board should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the management board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The management board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report. Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 1 March 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.

Appendix to our auditor's report on the financial statement 2017 of Beter Bed Holding N.V.
In addition to what is included in our auditor's report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.
The auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Our audit consisted, among other things of the following: · Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. · Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. · Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management board. · Concluding on the appropriateness of the management board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of publicinterest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.
BETER BED HOLDING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 97

We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
