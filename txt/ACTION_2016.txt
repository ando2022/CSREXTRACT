REPORT OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD OF ACTION S.A. IN RESTRUCTURING (the Company, the Issuer) ON OPERATIONS IN 2016
1. Basic figures and development prospects in the next year
In 2016, ACTION S.A. in restructuring earned sales revenue of PLN 2,585,059 thousand. The operating loss amounted to PLN -154,138 thousand and the net loss amounted to PLN -154,414 thousand. For the first time in its history, the Issuer closed the financial year with a loss both on the operating and the net levels.
The values presented above are affected by the results of the restructuring proceedings within the meaning of the provisions of the Restructuring Law Act of 15 May 2015 (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 978 ­ hereinafter: the Restructuring Law) pending at the Issuer's Company.
First and foremost, it must be emphasized that the decline in results for 2016 is largely of a nonmonetary nature. It is a consequence of a decision taken by the Issuer's Management Board (taking into account the auditor's suggestion) to assume a very conservative approach in determining the result. In particular, the Management Board of the Company states that the provisions recognised amount to 100% of the Company's potential liabilities in respect of the tax decisions received.
The most important events affecting the reported result are presented below:
1) Costs of provisions recognised ­ costs of provisions recognised for potential liabilities in respect of tax decisions issued in 2016 and provisions for the credit repayment guarantee granted to Lapado GmbH. The above events did not affect the Company's cash flows in 2016. Potential liabilities resulting from the above are subject to arrangement by virtue of law.
2) Costs of impairment write-downs on financial assets ­ mainly shares in subsidiaries: Sferis Sp. z o.o. and Lapado GmbH. The above events did not affect the Company's cash flows in 2016. The above was related to the implementation of the Restructuring Plan as regards consolidation of the Capital Group of ACTION S.A. in restructuring.
3) Losses related to the sale of goods in the course of remedial proceedings and direct costs of remedial proceedings in 2016, in line with the assumptions of the Restructuring Plan. The amount of the losses were increased by the value of the provision for losses that will be generated when sales continue in 2017.
4) Costs of impairment write-downs on receivables ­ costs related to the revaluation of receivables from subsidiaries and disputed receivables of ACTION S.A. in restructuring from other counterparties. The above event did not affect the Company's cash flows in 2016.
In the coming year, the Management Board envisages conducting a series of restructuring measures detailed in the Restructuring Plan of 2 November 2016. The main areas for the planned measures and basic pillars of the Company's new strategy are as follows:
I. Drawing benefits from the difficult market situation. II. Substantial changes in the organization of the Capital Group of ACTION S.A. in restructuring. III. Strong own brands of ACTION.
In the Management Board's opinion, the main factors influencing the financial performance in the future are: Regarding internal factors:

2. Material risk factors related to the Company's activities
Risks connected with the introduction of the Company's new strategy are directly related to factors affecting the entity's operations. The most essential factor, in the perspective of the Restructuring Plan implementation, will be the progress of the Company's restructuring proceedings. Any internal and external factors will predominantly depend on the follow-up of these proceedings.
2.1. Risk factors related to the Company's activities
2.1.1. Stockholding risk The main activity of the Company is the sale of technologically advanced goods, which are naturally exposed to the process of ageing and the resulting loss of value. Producers who market new models of products then lower the prices of the products they previously offered. As a result of the price protection clauses contained in the contracts with suppliers and the existing market practice in this area, the Company receives coverage of losses connected with the loss of value from all its key suppliers. Irrespective of the benefits arising from the price protection mechanisms, the Company tries to maintain a high rotation of its stocks.
2.1.2. Risk of losing receivables When it comes to value, trade receivables are the most important item in the Company's assets. As with any other entity dealing with trade, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some part of its ___________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 2

Report of the Management Board of ACTION S.A. in restructuring for 2016(all amounts are presented in PLN
thousand, unless specified otherwise)
receivables. This risk increases with the increasing economic slow-down in Poland and in the world. Last year, the risk of losing receivables was also significantly affected by the scale of the administrative and tax decisions taken. Bearing in mind the possibility of losing its receivables, the Company insures this risk, using the services of leading insurers.
Detailed information regarding financial instruments in the scope of: a) price risk, credit risk, cash flow risk and liquidity risk, to which the entity is exposed, b) financial risk management objectives and methods adopted by the entity, including the methods which are used to hedge major types of forecasted transactions in respect of which the hedge accounting method is used, is presented in Note 30 Financial Instruments and in Note 25 Hedge Accounting to the Separate Financial Statements.
2.2. Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates
2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation in Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. The eagerness of dealers to purchase new IT hardware, and consequently the value of purchases exercised by the recipients of the Company, are essentially related to growth in GDP, the level of investments, and how retail consumers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth ­ including that related to the implementation of investment projects ­ may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.
2.2.2. Currency risk The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates. ACTION S.A. in restructuring earns over 60% of its sales revenues in PLN and about 55% of goods are imported. Payments for imported goods are made mainly in EUR and in USD. Such a currency structure of cash flows exposes the Company to currency risk. The risk increases proportionally to the changes observed in the currency market. The Company tries to minimise the currency risk. For that reason, in 2011 the Company adopted the FX Risk Management Policy. The rules regarding the FX risk management adopted in the policy set optimal levels of hedging related to the existing currency positions and determine a system for monitoring and control related thereto. In accordance with the adopted hedge accounting principles, the Company is obliged to maintain hedges amounting to nearly 100% of the open currency position on an ongoing basis.
2.2.3. Legal environment risk The changing laws and various interpretations thereof constitute a risk to the operations of ACTION S.A. Potential changes in the law may lead in a direction that will cause adverse effects for the Company's operations. These changes may significantly influence the legal environment of the business activity. Bringing into effect a new regulation important for business life may lead to interpretation problems, incoherent court decisions, unfavourable interpretations assumed by the public administration organs, etc.
2.2.4. Tax policy risk The Polish tax system is characterised by frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of them are inadequately defined and few unequivocal interpretations exist. Interpretations of the tax provisions are subject to frequent changes; however, neither the practices applied by tax authorities nor the court rulings related to taxation are unified. Due to divergent interpretations of the tax provisions, the risk is greater in the case of a Polish company than in the case of a company operating in a more stable tax system. In such circumstances the Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements and tax returns may be deemed at variance with the tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. It is, however, expected that the proceedings before administrative courts consisting of two instances and the acquis communautaire will significantly influence the uniformity of court decisions related to taxes, leading in consequence to higher uniformity of tax law application, as also exercised by the tax authorities. One of the elements of the risk arising from tax regulations are the provisions related to the expiry of the limitation period of the tax obligation, which is connected with the possibility to verify
___________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 3

Report of the Management Board of ACTION S.A. in restructuring for 2016(all amounts are presented in PLN
thousand, unless specified otherwise)

whether tax liabilities were calculated correctly for the given period. Tax declarations determining the amount of tax liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by the inspection of tax authorities within five years following the end of the year in which the due date for the payment of the tax expired. In the case the tax authorities adopt an interpretation of tax regulations different than the interpretation adopted by the Company, which is the basis for the calculation of the tax liability, the situation may have an adverse impact on the operations of the Company, its financial situation, and, in consequence, its results and growth perspectives.
3. Corporate governance principles
ACTION S.A. in restructuring is subject to corporate governance principles included in "Good Practices of WSE Listed Companies" adopted by way of Resolution No 12/1170/2007 of the Supervisory Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange on 4 July 2007 presented in an appendix to the above-mentioned resolution. Since 1 January 2016, ACTION S.A. in restructuring has been subject to the corporate governance principles: "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies", adopted by way of Resolution No 26/1413/2015 of the Supervisory Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 13 October 2015. The text of the set of these principles is available on the WSE website (www.corp-gov.gpw.pl) and on the Company's website (www.action.pl). Application of these principles is voluntary. A statement concerning the application of corporate governance principles by ACTION S.A. in restructuring in 2016, constituting an appendix to this Report, will be published as a separate component of the Annual Report.
4. Material proceedings pending before a court, competent arbitration authority or public administration authority
As at the day of submitting this Report, no proceedings were ongoing at any courts, authorities competent for arbitration proceedings or public administration authorities in relation to the Company's liabilities or receivables whose value, determined separately for individual proceedings and in total for all the proceedings, would represent at least 10% of the Company's equity.

As agreed by the parties and in accordance with the accepted wording of Annex No 25, the parties agreed that the maximum availability of the overdraft is PLN 90,321 thousand (it is available for the Company until 31 January 2017) and ACTION S.A. in restructuring undertakes to repay the overdraft of PLN 40,321 thousand by 31 January 2017 and the remaining part of PLN 50,000 thousand by 31 December 2017 ­ it will be repaid in monthly instalments.
Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. decided to reduce, as of 4 August 2016, the amount of the limit granted to the amount of valid guarantees and letters of credit granted by the Bank, and to refuse issuing new guarantees or opening new letters of credit under the Agreement dated 20 May 2010, as amended. At the same time, the Bank decided to reduce, as of 4 August 2016, the amount of the credit granted to already disbursed amounts which, in the Bank's opinion, does not release it from the obligation to disburse the remaining portion of the granted but not disbursed overdraft facility. Following the above, the amounts of the credit granted by Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. under the Agreement dated 14 June 2005 were as follows: - PLN 37,519 thousand, - USD 615 thousand, - EUR 10,680 thousand. Until the date of extension of the agreement with the annex dated 31 January 2017, the Credit agreement, as regards the aforementioned amounts, were performed by the Bank in accordance with its wordings. On 31 January 2017, the Company agreed with Bank Pekao SA (the Bank) the wording of Annex No 25 of the overdraft facility agreement. As agreed by the parties and in accordance with the accepted wording of Annex No 25, the parties agreed that the maximum availability of the overdraft is PLN 90,321 thousand (it is available for the Company until 31 January 2017) and ACTION S.A. in restructuring undertakes to repay the overdraft of PLN 40,321 thousand by 31 January 2017 and the remaining part of PLN 50,000 thousand by 31 December 2017 ­ it will be repaid in monthly instalments. The Issuer informs, that the previous final maturity date of the aforementioned facility was 31 January 2017.
Pursuant to the resolution of the Board of Creditors dated 17 March 2017 (expressing a consent to the extension of maturity of the overdraft facility granted under Agreement No 2005/1006392654 of 14 June 2005 and refusal to establish joint legal collateral for the repayment of aforesaid Overdraft Facility and Investment Credit No 2014/126/DDF dated 19 May 2014), the Company agreed with Bank PEKAO S.A. (the Bank) the conditions for the extension of the overdraft agreement and collateral for claims under the above credit agreements. According to the wording of Annex No 26 to Overdraft Agreement No 2005/1006392654 dated 14 June 2005 and Annex No 5 to Investment Credit Agreement No 2014/126/ DDF dated 19 May 2014, the parties waived the provisions concerning joint collateral for claims under the aforesaid credit agreements.
On 20 April 2017, a meeting of the Board of Creditors of Action S.A. in restructuring was held. During this meeting, the Board of Creditors approved the Company's request to give consent to the conclusion of an annex with Bank PEKAO S.A., under which the bank will grant new financing in the form of a revolving overdraft facility, on condition that the Company will not establish any new collateral in favour of Bank PEKAO S.A. and will not increase additional collateral. Based the above, the Company is authorised to sign Annex No 27 to Overdraft Facility Agreement No 2005/1006392654, under which the Bank will grant a multi-currency revolving overdraft facility (the "Facility") in Polish zloty ("PLN"), US ___________________________________________________________________________________________

thousand, unless specified otherwise)
dollars ("USD") or euro ("EUR"). The Facility will be granted for the period until 29 December 2017 (the "Facility Term"). Until the last date of the Facility Term, the Facility is revolving. The maximum total amount of the Facility on the date of concluding Annex No 27 to the Agreement is EUR 9,135 thousand, according to the NBP exchange rate on the date of the annex. The Facility is to be utilised to finance the current operations of the Borrower.
10.2 Short-term Credit Agreement No 2003/028 concluded on 6 November 2003 with Societe Generale S.A. (the Bank)
The Bank granted ACTION S.A. in restructuring a short-term revolving overdraft facility amounting to PLN 30,000 thousand for financing its current operations. The final repayment deadline for the facility was set on 29 May 2017.
In accordance with Current Report No 40/2016, Management Board of ACTION S.A. in restructuring stated that the letter concerning a refusal to grant a guarantee was accompanied by an additional letter in which the Bank informed the Issuer that in accordance with par. 2.5 of Short-term Credit Agreement No 2003/028 of 6 November 2003, as amended, concluded between the Bank and the Company (the Credit Agreement), any notification of credit drawing must have the consent of the Bank. The Bank will not give its consent to the notice of drawing and thus there will be no disbursement of drawing indicated in the notice of drawing. At the same time, the Bank notes that the condition described in par. 2.4.2 of the Credit Agreement (under which an effective drawing is possible only where there is no event as a result of which the credit would mature early) was not met due to the existence of circumstances described in par. 8.1.7 of the Credit Agreement and, pursuant to par. 2.4 of the Credit Agreement, it will not be possible to perform any drawing, and thus the submission of further notifications of drawing described in par. 2.5 of the Credit Agreement will not be justified. According to the provisions of par. 8.1.7, the Bank will be entitled to refuse access to any drawings after receiving a notification of drawing by the Client, if an event occurs that could have a significant influence on the Client's business, the balance of its assets, its economic or financial position. At the same time, the Bank did not clarify, which events would, in its opinion, indicate the circumstances specified in par. 8.1.7. The letter indicates, that the Bank refuses to implement the credit agreement in accordance with its wording. The letter received from the Bank did not indicate that it constituted a notice of termination of the aforesaid agreement.

In the letter, the Bank confirmed that the aforementioned decision does not mean a termination of the credit agreement.

failure to comply with the credit agreement (in particular, the nature of the Material Negative Effect) or the loss of the Issuer's creditworthiness. The Bank's decision does not establish any deadline for its entry into force. The Management Board of ACTION S.A. in restructuring (the Company, Issuer) states that at the beginning of August 2016 it received information from HSBC Bank Polska S.A. with its registered office in Warsaw about sending notifications to some counterparties of the Company on the transfer of the Issuer's claims in relation to these counterparties and a demand for payment to bank accounts indicated by the Bank, which are not the Issuer's bank accounts.

to other entities Bank guarantees of the total amount (USD 368 thousand) PLN 1,538 thousand; Bank guarantees of the total amount (EUR 538 thousand) PLN 2,384 thousand; Bank guarantees of the total amount PLN 3,000 thousand; Letters of credit in respect of supplies of goods of (USD 501 thousand) PLN 2,095 thousand. to related entities Corporate guarantees of (EUR 12,200 thousand) PLN 53,973 thousand; Surety agreements of PLN 400 thousand.

15. Assessment of financial resource management

Liquidity ratios Current ratio (current assets / current liabilities) Quick ratio (liquid current assets / current liabilities) Cash ratio (cash / current liabilities)

31/12/2016 1.01 0.77 0.23

31/12/2015 1.34 0.85 0.03

The Issuer continues to present high levels of liquidity ratios. The ratios reported at the end of 2016 are so high due to, to a large extend, the events resulting from the ongoing restructuring process. A significant reduction in the scale of operations resulted in the release of significant amounts of cash that was previously frozen in the Company's inventories and receivables.

10. Share of own funds in the financing of current assets (7:1) in %

-24%

1%

25%

At the end of 2016, the majority of balance sheet items decreased significantly; however this applied in the largest extent to current assets and current liabilities. As was the case for liquidity ratios, the main reason for such significant changes were the events related to the introduction and implementation of the restructuring proceedings described earlier in the report. The above changes were largely affected by the reduction of operations in the low-margin and high-risk areas of the market, but also by disruptions in the implementation of deliveries experienced by the Issuer, in particular at the early stage of the restructuring process. As a result of the above, the demand for current assets has decreased and is currently easily covered with the Company's equity. It, however, should be remembered that the Company has not started the settlement of pre-remedial liabilities.

Debt ratios Total debt ratio Equity to assets ratio Interest-bearing debt/equity

31/12/2016 76% 24% 1.18

31/12/2015 71% 29% 0.60

At the end of 2016, all debt ratios deteriorated. The most important factor in the scale of changes observed was the net loss recorded that, to a large extent, decreased the balance of the Company's equity. Due to a very conservative approach to recognising provisions that decrease the financial result for 2016, the Company does not expect any further losses not indicated in the projections that constitute an appendix to the Restructuring Plan.
16. Assessment of ability to fulfil investment plans
The Company has no plans for any significant investment expenditure in the coming year.
17. Evaluation of the factors and non-typical events influencing the result of operations
In 2016, the most significant factor affecting the results of the Company was the opening of the restructuring proceedings at the Company and direct reasons related to the opening of the proceedings, i.e. tax decisions under which the Company was under threat of imminent enforcement or at least securing claims for payment of additional tax (for third parties who failed to pay the VAT ­ which should be emphasized clearly because the Company itself does not have any arrears in its own tax settlements except for the current ones that result from the Restructuring Law provisions and the ban on settling pre-remedial liabilities). In addition, in 2016 the Company experienced a sudden block on financing under agreements with HSBC and Societe Generale. The credit agreement also was not extended by PKO BP. Another negative factor was the revocation of credit limits by credit insurers for all entities of the ACTION Capital Group, which, in consequence, caused significant limitations in maintaining the scale of operations, including in particular in the area of purchasing and enforcing bonuses and other amounts due from suppliers. The above resulted in a significant decrease in the level of sales and to losses (mostly of a non-monetary nature) described in detail in the Company's financial statements for 2016.

18. Description of the external and internal factors significant for the Company's development
Factors significant for the Company's development are described in Section 1 of this Report.
