REPORT ON MANAGEMENT
FOREWORD
The Ascopiave Group closed 2015 with a net consolidated profit of Euro 45.4 million (Euro 37.3 million as of 31st December 2014), with an increase of Euro 8.0 million, +21.5% compared to the previous year.
The consolidated net assets at year-end amount to Euro 420.1 million, (Euro 409.7 million as of 31st December 2014) and the net capital invested to 534.2 million (539,3 million as of 31st December 2014).
In 2015 the Group accomplished investments for Euro 22.0 million (Euro 21.1 million as of 31st December 2014), mainly in the development, maintenance and modernisation of the networks and plants of gas distribution and the installation of electronic metres.
Activities
Ascopiave mainly operates in the sectors of distribution and sale of natural gas, as well as in other sectors related to the core business, such as the sale of electric power, heat management and co-generation.

The Group currently holds concessions and direct assurances for the supply of the service in 208 municipalities (208 municipalities as of 31st December 2014) and has a distribution network extending for over 8,300 km1 (over 8,200 km as of 31st December 2014), and providing a service to a catchment area bigger than 1 million inhabitants.

The activity of natural gas sale to end customers is carried out through subsidiaries of the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A., controlled exclusively or jointly with other shareholders. In the gas sale segment, Ascopiave is one of the main National operators with about 961 million cu.m1 of gas sold in 2015 (888 million cu.m1 as of 31st December 2014).

Strategic objectives
Ascopiave aims to pursue a strategy focused on the creation of value for its stakeholders, by maintaining the level of excellence in the quality of services offered, in the respect of the environment and social groups, to increase the value of the field in which it operates.

The Group intends to consolidate its leadership position in the gas sector on a regional level and is looking to reach a prominent position also at the national level, taking advantage of the liberalization process currently underway. In this respect, Ascopiave follows a development strategy whose main guiding principles are dimensional growth, diversification in other divisions of the energy sector in synergy with the core business and the improvement of operative processes.

1 The data specified as regards the length of the distribution network and the volumes of gas sold are obtained by adding each Group company's data,
previously pondering the data of the companies consolidated with the equity method according to the relevant share.

Management trend
The volumes of gas sold in 2015 are equal to 961.3 million cubic metres, marking an increase of 8.2% compared to the previous year.
The volumes of electrical energy sold were 409.6 GWh, marking a decrease of 10.9% compared to the previous year.
As to the activity of gas distribution, the volumes distributed through networks managed by the Group were 859.3 million cu.m., marking an increase of 10.8% as compared to 2014. The distribution network as of 31st December 2015 has an extension of 8,312 km (8,227 km as of 31st December 2014).
Economic results and financial situation
Consolidated revenues of 2015 of the Ascopiave Group equal Euro 581.7 million, compared to Euro 585.3 million of the previous year. The decrease in the turnover is mainly due to the reduction in the revenues on electricity sale (Euro 6.0 million), due to lower volumes sold.
The Operating Result of the Group equals Euro 57.0 million, marking an increase compared to Euro 52.7 million in 2014. The increase in the Operating Result is mainly connected to improved results of the gas sale activity, explained by an increase in the volume of gas sold and a general decrease in the costs for services and other operating expenses.
The Net Result, equalling Euro 43.0 million, marks an increase compared to Euro 35.6 million of 2014, due to a decrease in net financial charges and an improvement in the operating earnings of the companies consolidated through the equity method, which have more than offset the increased fiscal charges on income taxes.
The Net Financial Position of the Group as of 31st December 2015 is equal to Euro 114.0 million, with an increase of Euro 156 million as compared to Euro 129.7 million as of 31st December 2014. The cash flow of the fiscal year (given by the sum of the net result, allocations, amortization and depreciations) has generated financial resources for Euro 69.4 million. The investment activity and the management of the working capital have absorbed financial resources for Euro 21.9 million and 0.5 million respectively, whereas the management of equity (distribution of dividends and dividends received by the companies consolidated with the equity method) has absorbed resources for Euro 31.4 million. The ratio between Net financial position and Net equity as of 31st December 2015 is equal to 0.27 (0.32 as of 31st December 2014).

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________ The structure of the Ascopiave Group
The table below shows the company structure of the Ascopiave Group as of 31st December 2015.

The general economic context
The global economic outlook in 2015, although improving in advanced countries, is still subject to risks. The weakness of emerging markets2 has curbed the expansion of global trade, thus contributing to a contraction in raw material prices, which have fallen below the lows reached during the economic crisis in 2008-2009. Although a modest acceleration is expected in the coming years, the estimates remain subject to doubts and uncertainties. In early-2016, in fact, new financial tensions emerged in the Chinese market and the recession in Brazil exacerbated, accompanying the fears about the growth of the economy in the two countries. In contrast to this situation, the Indian economy is positively evolving, and the Russian domestic product is slowing down its drop.

Some recent OECD projections estimate that in 2015 the global domestic product increased on average by 2.9% as compared to the previous year, and that 2016 will show a slightly positive trend, on the rise by 3.3%. In the coming years, the economic expansion is expected to be increasingly differentiated in the advanced countries, where in the face of a more modest increase in Europe (+1.8%) and Japan (+1.0%), a more marked expansion is expected in the United States (+2.5%) and the UK (+2.4%). Emerging economies showed different trends in 2015. In India, despite high inflation, growth has strengthened (+7.2%) and in China, although an escalation of financial tensions, an economic expansion has however been recorded (+6.8%). In Brazil and Russia instead, the growth of the domestic product has slowed down, respectively by -3.1% and -4.0%. In the advanced countries, consumer price inflation, at the end of 2015, remained at very low levels and even weak in China. The trend of consumer prices, however, is still high in India, Brazil and in Russia, driven by the sharp depreciation of the Ruble and by Western sanctions connected to the Ukrainian crisis. In 2015, the average annual inflation in the Euro area, measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, amounted to 0.0% as compared to +0.4% in 2014. Within the Euro zone, the economic indicators showed a slight recovery in 2015, albeit with persistent divergences among the major European economies. The growth of the GDP in the Euro area in 2015 as compared to the previous year is expected around 1.5%, a restrained expansion due to both the new fall in the prices of energy goods and the persistence of large margins of underused production capacity.

With regard to the economic situation of the Italian economy, in 2015 the economic activity was characterised by a somewhat gradual growth. Exports, which had supported the activities over the previous years, have started to weaken due to the decrease in non-European demand and they are gradually being replaced by a recovery in domestic demand. The cyclical manufacturing conditions appear to be favourable and they are also associated with an expansion in services and a stabilisation in the construction industry. In 2015, the GDP increased by 0.8% as compared to the previous year and the positive variations in the national end consumption, equal to 0.5%, and in gross fixed capital formation, 0.8%, have contributed to its growth. As concerns interchange with foreign countries instead, exports of goods and services have increased by 4.3% and imports by 6.0%. The unemployment rate in December, equal to +11.4%, without taking into account seasonal factors, showed a slight increase as compared to the previous month (+0.1% with respect to November) and a decrease as compared to 2014 (+12.4% in 2014). Average Italian inflation in 2015, measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, recorded values in line with the Euro zone: +0.1%. Price dynamics have stabilised around zero in the last months of 2015, reflecting in particular the weakness of costs, specifically those related to energy, and the intense and prolonged contraction of household expenditure.

Evolution of international energy prices In 2015, the Euro/Dollar exchange rate recorded an annual average equal to 1.11 USD per Euro (a decrease as compared to the 2014 average), achieving a maximum of 1.20 USD per Euro (January 2015) and a minimum value of 1.06 USD per Euro (April 2015). After a decrease in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate in the first months of 2015 up to early-April, the EU currency started a gradual appreciation with respect to the U.S. Dollar, fluctuating mostly within the range of 1.15 ­ 1.1 USD per Euro and declining again only in late-2015.

In 2015, the cost of crude oil decreased considerably. Since January 2015, the price of oil (Brent) has remained fairly stable between $ 50-65 per barrel until it reached its maximum value in mid-May ($ 66.33 per barrel). Subsequently, since summer, oil price has started to decrease and its value has almost halved and reached its lowest annual level in late December ($ 35.6 per barrel). As far as the Euro ratings are concerned, the decrease was more moderate because of the depreciation of the EU currency with respect to the U.S. Dollar.

Its performance, and especially its decline, much faster than other raw materials, is explained by the expansion of the offer and the weak demand. The downward trend in late 2015, also confirmed in January 2016, was particularly affected by the change in the strategy adopted by the OPEC since 1992. Agreed production targets are no longer established and therefore the petroleum exporting countries are no longer willing to curb the drop in prices in a context where, however, a gradual increase in supply (Iran after lifting the international sanctions, the United States although for more modest amounts than in previous years) is expected. Moreover, as concerns the demand, a limited growth below expectations for some emerging economies (China and Brazil) and the fragile growth of the Euro area, have led operators to revise downward the estimated oil consumption for the next periods.

The gas system in Europe:

In 2015, the global gas market continued to grow, both in terms of demand and supply, albeit at a quite moderate pace. While the United States have continued to play a dominant role in the growth of consumption, Europe and Asia, also because of the current cost of coal which has affected gas consumption for the production of electricity, have played a

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
less relevant role. It is estimated that European consumption, after years of negative trends, is resuming its growth even if the year 2015 was characterised by relatively mild temperatures and an increasing focus on efficiency and energy saving. Natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel than coal and oil, easy to control and efficient for distribution and use, and the current economic scenario offers a good alternative in the immediate path towards sustainability. Its use does not require new technological innovations and, at the same time, it is estimated that its conventional reserves can be a good source of energy for several years. However, if until a few years ago the European scenario of the gas market based its development forecasts on a number of rather well-known elements, in recent years something unexpected has changed what was imagined in previous years. The economic downturn has caused a decline in demand in many areas: the boom of renewable energy sources, the decrease in domestic production and the increasingly important role of LNG, which was rather predictable, were all factors that had already been considered in the evolutionary scenarios developed in recent years. However, the recent evolution of the U.S. market in this area through the application of new extraction technologies and, subsequently, the strong competitiveness of coal in thermal power generation was not expected. In the context of this change in the evolutionary scenario, Europe is continuing the integration of infrastructures and market, but at the same time it is also exploring the potential use of natural gas in fields in which it had not been traditionally used (for example, it is envisaged to use compressed natural gas -CNG- in the transport sector for urban mobility and to avail of LNG for the transport of heavy goods over long distances and in the maritime transport of passengers and goods).
The gas market: the Italian scenario
Gas demand in Italy and its coverage sources In the solar year 2015, the gross domestic consumption of gas in Italy recorded an increase of 9.1% as compared to 2014, reaching 67.52 billion cubic metres (source: Ministry of Economic Development.) Demand highlights an improvement as compared to the previous year, marking an increase of 5.61 billion cu.m., significantly influenced by the indirect effect of the slight economic recovery. The coverage of gas demand was performed mainly through the recourse to import sources that in 2015 achieved a level of 61.20 billion cu.m., an increase of 5.44 billion cu.m. compared to 2014 (+9.8%). With respect to 2014, the quantities traded are recording a recovery at almost all interconnection points, except the point connected to Northern Europe (Passo Gries -7.0%). On the rise, instead, the interconnection point connected to Russia (Tarvisio +14.4%) and Northern Africa (Gela +9.1% and Mazara del Vallo +6.9%). The volumes of gas imported from the entry point in Cavarzere, coming from the LNG terminal off the coast of Veneto (+33.6% as compared to 2014) are increasing, whereas the volumes coming from the LNG in Panigaglia are decreasing (-52.3% as compared to 2014).
National production of natural gas In 2015, Italian production of gas, equal to 6.77 billion cubic metres, recorded a decrease of 5.3% as compared to 2014, covering approximately 10.03% of the national consumption. The gas supplies in Italy are running out, and the contribution of national production to cover requirements will become ever more marginal.

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Development prospects for Gas Demand in Italy Given the great uncertainty surrounding the outlook for demand, both in terms of the evolution of economic growth and the new fierce competition of other energy sources, there are now several scenarios about the future evolution of the Italian gas demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA), within the "New Policies Scenario", forecasts that in Italy gas consumption will be substantially stable until 2020. In recent years, our Country has shown a downward trend in natural gas consumption, due to the influence of both the economic downturn and the fiercer competition of renewable sources in the electricity generation sector. This decline in demand, together with the regulatory and infrastructural interventions undertaken in recent years at both national and European level, have led to a substantial alignment of Italian gas prices with European prices. The actions aimed at market organization and enhancement of the structures in Italy, continued throughout 2015 and promoted the integration of the gas sector in the EU context. In the future, an important contribution to integration and competitiveness of the Italian gas market is expected with the completion and commissioning of new projects for the supply of gas. Although Italy has shown a decrease in gas consumption in recent years, because of its strong dependence on this commodity, it is included among the European countries most associated with gas consumption, so that it can still be defined as a "Gas Country". Thanks to the presence of a well diversified portfolio of supplies from various regions (mainly North Africa, Norway, Russia and The Netherlands), featuring an already high level of competition and a large storage potential, the Italian market has all the necessary characteristics to truly become a reference market in Europe. If the country continues to invest in infrastructure development, particularly with regard to the interconnections with the rest of the European gas network and the reverse flows, in order to create a single integrated network not affected by congestions, and if it proves that it has a flexible system capable of systematically meeting peaks in demand, it will be highly possible for the Italian gas market to become a reference market in Europe as the main South-European hub.

The gas system in Italy: import and re-gasification infrastructures The configuration of the import and re-gasification infrastructure for natural gas in Italy has remained substantially unchanged compared to the previous years. The current new projects related to the introduction of upgrades and/or new energy infrastructures fall within the strategic plan which envisages an increasingly marginal importance of Russian natural gas supply in a context in which natural gas is the main national energy source. Although in recent years consumption has slowed down due to the economic downturn, the primary objective is to prevent geopolitical instability that could jeopardise the stability of supply. To this end, the supply should be diversified. The Tap, a project that would allow the import of gas to Italy via Greece and Albania, also enabling the supply from the natural gas reserves located in the Caspian Sea region, Russia and the Middle East, in autumn 2015 made remarkable progresses. Among the import infrastructures currently being planned, it is the most likely to be actually realised. However, the feasibility studies for the IGI Poseidon project, a gas pipeline which, via Greece and Turkey, would allow Italy to import natural gas from the Caspian Sea and the Middle East, are still underway as well. As concerns re-gasification plants, which have become a seriously competitive supply alternative to methane pipelines, able to bypass the obstacles presented by the limited shipment capacity available on the import gas pipelines networks, in Italy three plants are in operation: Panigaglia in La Spezia, Porto Levante in Rovigo and Livorno Offshore in Livorno. Our Country has at its disposal at least a dozen of projects regarding the realization of new LNG terminals.

Because of the bureaucratic difficulties, the litigations filed by the local bodies, the technical setbacks and, above all, the decisions taken by the potential investors following the development prospects of the industry and the profitability of the investments, we believe that not all of them can be realised.

Gas sale

Gas sale is the main activity of the Group in terms of contribution to company revenues. This is a liberalised activity, in which a competitive comparison has developed between the operators, which will become ever fiercer following further opening of the markets upstream of the chain (production and import). The majority of analysts foresee that, on the medium term, shares will be redefined between the strongest subjects, and there will be an overall reduction in the number of operators.

Gas distribution

Gas distribution is the second activity of the Group in terms of contribution to company revenues.

This activity is carried out as a concession or direct allocation and, as such, is subject to strict regulation by the public

authorities, with regards to both management methods and tariffs.

As it is known, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 introduced the compulsory allocation of the gas distribution service

through a call for tenders, assuming that a competition mechanism involving the selection of the provider would allow

for a limitation of costs for the end customer and an improvement in the quality of the service supplied.

Law Decree 159/2007 (Law 222/2007) has introduced, for the first time, the concept of Minimum Territorial Tender

(Atem) for the management of the service, establishing that the tenders shall be invited in minimum territorial areas.

The Atem tender was definitely adopted as a basic rule for the sector with Legislative Decree 93/2011, which has

forbidden, commencing June 2011, the launch of invitations to tender in the single Municipalities, ratifying the

obligation to launch tenders exclusively in minimum territorial areas.

Therefore, as to the distribution activity as well, the majority of analysts foresee, in the medium term, a strong

concentration in the offer, with a reduction in the number of operators and an enlargement of the average size of the

companies.

From 2011, with special reference to calls for tenders in territorial areas, the regulatory framework of the industry was

In particular:

1)

the Decree dated 19th January 2011 issued by the Ministry for economic Development in agreement with the

Ministry for the Relationship with Regions and Territorial Cohesion, the territorial areas for issuing calls for

tenders to entrust the gas distribution service were identified;

2)

with subsequent Decree dated 18th December 2011, the municipalities belonging to each territorial area were

also identified (the so-called Territorial Areas Decree);

3)

the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry of Employment and Social

Policies on 21st April 2011 contained provisions ruling the social effects connected to the assignment of the

new gas distribution concessions, thus implementing paragraph 6 of art. 28 of Legislative Decree no. 164

issued on 23rd May 2000 (the so-called Workforce Protection Decree);

4)

with the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development on 12th November 2011, the regulatory

norms concerning the criteria to be applied to calls for tenders and the evaluation of the offer for assigning the

gas distribution service were approved (the so-called Decree for Criteria). The issuance of ministerial decrees played a major role in giving certainty to the competitive environment within which operators will move in the coming years, thus laying the foundations for allowing the process of market opening - that started with the implementation of European directives - to produce the benefits hoped for. The Ascopiave Group - as indeed many other operators - favourably welcomed the emerging regulatory framework, believing that it actually creates important opportunities for investments and development to qualified operators of medium size, going in the direction of a positive rationalization of the offer. At the end of 2013, with Law Decree 23/12/2013, no. 145, converted with amendments into Law 9/2014, art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000, which provides for the determination of the reimbursement value of the plants due to the outgoing operator at the end of the so-called "Transitional Period" was substantially modified. In June 2014, the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development containing the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" entered into force, which, although formally aimed at explaining the criteria to assess the value of plants pursuant to art. 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011, essentially establishes a peculiar framework, which implements only to a minimum extent art. 5 above. Subsequently, with Law Decree 91/2014, amended and converted into Law 116/2014, another substantial change was made to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000. The contents of the revised text and its evolution are described in sections "National regulations" and "Goals and policies of the Group and description of risks" of this financial report. Finally, in mid-2015, the Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development no. 106, dated 20th May 2015, amended the previous Ministerial Decree 226/2011, reformulating Article 5, concerning the criteria to calculate the value of the plants. The new Decree has basically "transferred" the content of the Guidelines (mentioned above) into its text. Concisely, this measure has made Article 5 compatible with the Guidelines, which would have been a specification/clarification.

The regulatory framework

National regulations
Reference regulatory framework

Law no. 208 dated 28th December 2015 - "Provisions for the preparation of the yearly and long-term State budget (socalled 2016 Stability Law)". With this law, published in the Official Gazette no. 302 of 30th December 2015, the legislature approved the budget policy for 2016 and the following years. The main changes introduced by the measure, as far as the gas and electricity sectors are concerned, include the insertion of the Rai television license fee in the electricity bill and the redefinition of the regulations governing the purchase of services by the Public Administration. By Modifying Law Decree dated 21st February 1938, no. 246, converted by Law 4th June 1938, no. 880, the legislature has established that electricity suppliers shall charge in the bill a Euro 100,00 fee for the subscription of the Rai television license. This amount shall be divided into ten instalments which, only in 2016, will be paid commencing 1st July 2016. As specified by the law, the possession of a television receiver is presumed if electricity is supplied to the place where a

person legally resides and the fee is due once for all the televisions installed in the places where the person resides or lives with the persons belonging to the same family. The amount of the instalments will be separately indicated in the invoice and will not be taxable. The amounts collected by the companies will be directly transferred to the tax authorities by means of a unitary payment. As far as the provisions for the purchase of services by the public administration are concerned, the legislator has amended the Law Decree dated 6th July 2012, no. 95, converted with amendments by Law 7th August 2012, no. 135, containing "Urgent provisions for the review of public spending without effects on services to citizens, as well as measures to strengthen the capital of banks". This confirms that the public administration may award tenders even beyond the conventions or the framework agreements provided by Consip and the central regional commissions, provided they follow tenders from other central commissions or public tenders, and envisage, unlike the previous regulations, fees that are at least 3 per cent lower than the best fees indicated by Consip and the regional commissions. Also confirmed, the provisions according to which the contracts entered into with the Public Administration should be terminated if conventions by the Consip or the central regional commissions become available, ensuring greater economic benefit (higher than 10 percent compared to contracts already signed) with the possibility for the contractor of adapting to the aforementioned fees. The contracts concluded in violation of this provision are null and void, constitute a case of professional misconduct and entail administrative liability.
Excise duties and VAT
Note of the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli File no. 33058 RU dated 30th November 2015. Following consultations with the Attorney General's Office, the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli with Note no. 33058 RU of 30th November 2015 confirmed the approach illustrated in its previous note no. 121523 RU dated 14th November 2014, confirming that the excise duty for industrial uses envisaged for natural gas consumption in hospitals can be applied with effect from 31st July 2014, both for existing supplies and new supplies. Therefore, the use of natural gas in hospitals is subject to excise duty, pursuant to art. 26 of Legislative Decree dated 26th October 1995, no. 504 - "Consolidated laws concerning taxes on production and consumption and related criminal and administrative penalties" with effect from that date, excluding the possibility of applying the tax break for the previous period.
Provisions of the AEEGSI The main measures issued by the AEEGSI during 2015 are the following:

With Resolution 550/2014/R/gas dated 10th November 2014, the AEEGSI introduced provisions relating to the retail marketing component (QVD) pursuant to art. 7 of the TIVG and in particular provides for the update of the QVD component with effect from 1st January 2015 and its subsequent review and structure. Compared to the QVD levels in force until 31st December 2014, commencing 1st January 2015 the values of the variable rate (0.7946 Euro-cents/Standard Cubic Meter) have been confirmed, whereas the fixed rate has increased by 0.41 Euro/Redelivery Point for domestic customers (from 57.35 to 57.76 Euro/Redelivery Point) and 0.54 Euro/Redelivery Point for condominiums (from 75.32 to 75.86 Euro/Redelivery Point). With the same resolution, the AEEGSI, as concerns the valuations of the QVD: has recognised a level of unpaid ratio equal to 1.99% (instead of 1.89%), postponed the possible introduction of a different relationship between fixed and variable rate, subsequent to an effective assessment of the possible effects in terms of competition, and postponed the review of credit management costs until the biannual update of the QVD, that is from 1st October 2015.
With Resolution 634/2014/R/gas dated 29th December 2014, the AEEGSI approved the updating of tariffs for gas distribution and metering services for the year 2015 (components 1 (dis), 1 (mis), 1 (cot) ­ amounting to 1.20 Euro/Redelivery Point/year and valid in all the tariff areas without distinction, by group ­ and 3 (dis)). According to art. 40.9 of the RTDG, commencing 1st January 2015, the components 1 (dis) ­ to cover the capital costs related to the distribution service ­ and 1 (mis) ­ to cover the operating and capital costs related to the metering service ­ are divided according to the following groups: measurement Group G6; G6 < Measurement Group G40; Measurement Group > G40.

With Resolution 672/2014/R/gas dated 29th December 2014, the AEEGSI updated the economic conditions of supply of the protection service, for the quarter from January to March 2015. The updates published with such resolution concerned in particular: the CMEM component (fixing its value at 7.466763 Euro/GJ); the PFOR,t element (element to cover the natural gas procurement costs); the QTVt element (variable fee to cover the costs related to self-consumption gas, network leakage and gas not recognized); the element (percentage recognized with reference to network leakage and gas not recognized); the QTFi element (fee to cover the costs of transportation of gas from the Virtual Trading Point to the transport network); the QTMCV element (element to cover the surcharge elements of the CV variable coverage element applied within the transport service to the volumes placed on the network, upstream from the Virtual Trading Point); the QTPSV element (element to cover the transportation costs from the Italian border to the Virtual Trading Point); the UG3 component (component to cover interruption charges), belonging to the mandatory tariff for distribution and measurement services.

With Resolution 675/2014/R/com dated 29th December 2014 the AEEGSI defined the values of the components for the coverage of general charges in accordance with the mandatory tariff of the distribution service and the values of the compensation of expenses incurred for the supply of natural gas. The updates published concern, in particular: the GS component; the RE component; the RS component and the UG1 component. From 2015, the components above are amended with two separate rates to be applied to annual consumption up to 200,000 standard cubic meters and higher

energy procurement; 7.99% for retail sales; 17.51% for the services of distribution, measurement, transport, distribution equalisation, quality; 24.47% for general system costs and 13.38% for taxes.
With Resolution 582/2015/R/eel dated 2nd December 2015 - "Reform of grid tariffs and tariff components to cover general system costs for electricity customers. Simultaneous updating of expense compensations for household customers in economic distress" - the AEEGSI initiated the reform process of the tariffs applied to household electricity customers. This process, in force since 1st January 2016, will end on 1st January 2018. The measure envisages in particular: the termination of the progressive structure of rates for grid services and general system costs as concerns low voltage household customers, in particular:
Effective 1st January 2016, the progressive structure of the tariff components for transmission, distribution and metering services was reduced with respect to the volumes withdrawn, whereas the current division into groups remains unchanged; Within 1st January 2017, the progressive structure of rates for grid services will be definitively superseded and a gradual phase for the replacement of the progressive mechanism also as regards general system costs will be initiated as well. The tariff structure affected by the resolution, in fact, requires the application of two different structures characterised by the progressive nature of the fees based on consumption, that is the D2 tariff for low voltage supplies for domestic use at the registered residence with committed power capacity up to 3 kW and the D3 tariff for all other supplies not covered by the D2 voltage tariff. the review of power capacity levels and the costs for level change: Effective 1st January 2017, in order to ensure that customers benefit from greater choice, the intermediate power levels will be increased compared to those currently in place; with effect from the same date, the connection contributions and the fixed charges that the customer will be required to pay in order to change the contractual power level if the change is remotely performed by the distributor, will be reset for at least 24 months; update of the social bonus values with effect from 1st January 2016, to be defined in a subsequent ruling; introduction of new provisions on heat pumps trial tariffs: extension until 31st December 2016 of the deadline within which customers can join the D1 tariff probationary period; launch of a consultation phase for the purposes of extending the D1 tariff probationary period to other household customers; further obligations under the scope of the sellers: the resolution makes reference to subsequent regulations as regards the further obligations under the scope of the sales companies. In particular, the maximum monthly amount of power withdrawn shall be made available to domestic customers, and the status of registered residence for household customers with power higher than 3 kW shall be identified, because, according to the AEEGSI, it is not properly tracked.

With Resolution 57/2015/R/gas dated 19th February 2015, the AEEGSI approved the procedures for the collection, storage and processing by the Authority of the tender documents submitted to the Authority by the awarding entities, pursuant to the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 2 of decree no. 226/11, aimed at preserving, among other things, the confidentiality of the information and data contained in the tender documents.

With reference to the consultation document 251/2014/R/gas, the AEEGSI, with Resolution 117/2015/R/gas dated 19th March 2015 defined the "Reform of the regulations governing the measurement of the distribution network's redelivery points, implementing legislative decree 102/2014".

This reform has introduced important innovations as concerns the collection and availability of the data by the distribution companies, self-reading procedures and changes in switching time.

Specifically, with regard to the Redelivery Points not equipped with smart meters, the following requirements have

been issued: & the redefinition of consumption categories with effect from 1st January 2016 (with the introduction of an additional
category for consumption higher than 1,500 standard cubic meters/year and up to 5,000 standard cubic meters/year

for which the Distributor will be required to ensure at least three reading attempts per year); & the definition of the relevant reading periods for each annual consumption category, within which the distributor is
required to perform reading attempts covering in each case at least 80% of the period (commencing 1st January

2016 for the Redelivery Points with annual consumption up to 500 standard cubic meters/year, the relevant period

is one year; for the Redelivery Points with annual consumption higher than 500 standard cubic meters/year and up to 1,500 standard cubic meters/year, the relevant periods shall be: April to October and November to March; for the Redelivery Points with annual consumption higher than 1,500 standard cubic meters/year and up to 5,000 standard

cubic meters/year, the relevant periods shall be: November to January, February to April, May to October; for the Redelivery Points with annual consumption higher than 5,000 standard cubic meters/year, the relevant period is

equal to one month). & effective 1st January 2016, the distributor will be required to perform, in case of Redelivery Points which are not

accessible or partially accessible, a further reading attempt following two consecutive unsuccessful attempts and lack of validated self-readings;

& the confirmation of the obligation, commencing 1st September 2016, to perform the attempt to read the newly-

activated Redelivery Points with consumption up to 5,000 standard cubic meters/year within 6 months of activation; & the confirmation of the obligation for the distributor to adopt, for the purposes of measurement validation, the unified national algorithm defined by the AEEGSI.

As concerns the Redelivery Points equipped with smart meters, the following provisions apply: & the extension of the mandatory monthly reading, with daily details, already required for Redelivery Points whose
class is higher than or equal to G40; the execution, commencing the first day of the fourth month following the commissioning, of at least three

attempts to collect the monthly measurement data; the introduction of the obligation to perform at least three attempts to record the measurements relating to the

month M, in the event of an unsuccessful attempt, together with the metering of the M+1 month. The deadline for making available the measurement data and any corrections has also changed, as well as the regulations on remote-reading management with the introduction, in particular, of the obligation for the Seller to

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
provide end customers with a self-reading collection system, regardless of the consumption level and the type of market for the Redelivery Points not equipped with smart meters, whereas for the Redelivery Points equipped with smart meters, only in the event of suspected/ascertained malfunction of the measurement group or in the presence of written complaints regarding the measurement or repeated billings based on estimates. Finally, the resolution above has amended Resolution 229/01 (relating to the contractual conditions of the gas sale service applicable to customers who are entitled to the protection service), Resolution 138/04 (relating to switching technical data management procedures and any requests for the correction of the measurement data submitted), Resolution 631/2013/R/gas (in relation to the commissioning of gas metering equipment), as well as resolution 574/2013/R/gas ­ RQDG (concerning the quality indicator related to the collection of measurements and measurement frequency for accessible meters, as well as the methods for charging the automatic compensation in the event of noncompliance with the measurement frequency envisaged for accessible meters).
With Resolution 162/2015/R/gas dated 9th April 2015, the AEEGSI requires the Users accredited for the SII, in their capacity as distribution companies, both for the electricity and the gas sectors, and in their capacity as providers for the protected market - serving over fifty thousand pick-up/redelivery points - to adopt a Porta di Comunicazione (PdC ­ Communication Port) for the implementation of the processes managed by the system.
With Resolution 276/2015/R/gas dated 9th June 2015, the AEEGSI approved urgent provisions in relation to the outcomes of the first adjustment session announced in May.
With Resolution 291/2015/R/gas dated 18th June 2015, the AEEGSI initiated a procedure for reviewing the timing relating to the equalisation mechanisms for the natural gas distribution and measurement services and for the adoption of measures concerning adjustments of the data transmitted for the purposes of equalisation, in order to make the relevant provisions of the RTDG consistent with the provisions relating to equalisation managed by the Cassa conguaglio per il settore elettrico for other services of sectors under the scope of the AEEGSI.
With Resolution 336/2015/R/gas dated 9th July 2015 - "Update of percentage values necessary for the definition of the standard pick-up profiles for the thermal year 2015-2016" - the AEEGSI determined the updating of the percentage values of the benchmarks necessary to define the standard pick-up profiles for the thermal year 1st October 2015 ­ 30th September 2016, pursuant to article 5.3 of the TISG (Consolidated Law on Gas Settlement).
With Resolution 373/2015/R/gas dated 23rd July 2015 the AEEGSI corrected some minor errors found in the RTDG with reference to the provisions on the GS component of the mandatory tariff pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 3, letter c), RTDG, to cover the tariff compensation system for economically disadvantaged customers, and the formula of the restriction on the revenues to cover location costs related to the distribution service, pursuant to Article 35, paragraph 1, RTDG.
With Resolution 396/2015/R/gas dated 30th July 2015, the AEEGSI amended the timing relating to the equalisation mechanisms for the natural gas distribution and measurement services, and introduced provisions on the adjustments of the data transmitted to the Cassa conguaglio per il settore elettrico for the purposes of equalisation.

With Resolution 407/2015/R/gas dated 30th July 2015, the AEEGSI amended Resolution 310/2014/R/gas. In particular, these amendments are attributable, on the one hand, to the innovations in the transfer of network portions for consideration by the outgoing operator to the incoming operator, introduced by the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomy dated 20th May 2015, no. 106, published in the Official Gazette of 14th July 2015, which approves the Regulation amending the Decree dated 12th November 2011, no. 226, concerning the tender criteria for the award of the natural gas distribution service (hereinafter: Decree 20th May 2015), and on the other hand the introduction of the possibility for the awarding entities, following a reasoned request and with a view to administrative streamlining, of presenting data on the Residual Industrial Value and the RAB, to be used in gap assessments by the Authority, pertaining to 31st December of the year t-2 .

With Resolution 427/2015/R/gas dated 3rd September 2015 ­ "Review of the method for calculating the conversion coefficient of the volumes measured for natural gas in the redelivery points where G6-class meters or lower are installed" - the AEEGSI introduced the review of the method for calculating the conversion coefficient of the volumes of gas measured pursuant to Article 6 of the RTDG (that is for the redelivery points with a relative measurement pressure equal to or less than 0.025 bar, only equipped with apparatuses for the correction of gas taken at standard temperature and characterised by a difference in height lower than/equal to or higher than 150 m. between the ground where the buildings served by the same Redelivery Points are located and the altitude above sea level of the Municipality where the Redelivery Point is located). The new calculation methods will enter into force commencing 10th January 2016 and a transitional period during which the Distributors may optionally calculate the coefficient according to the new methods will be granted. In conclusion, the distributors will be required to communicate to vendors that the method for calculating the value of the coefficient C in the redelivery point has changed by using dedicated information channels.

With Resolution 460/2015/R/gas dated 14th October 2015 - "Update, with effect from 1st January 2016, of the components to cover the costs arising from the insurance in favour of the end users of the gas distributed via local gas pipelines and transport networks" - the AEEGSI updated, with effect from 1st January 2016: & the value of the annual fee to be charged to the end customer, equal to 0.20 /Redelivery Point/year; & the cost per insured Redelivery Point (Cp element) incurred by the sellers, equal to 0.60 /Redelivery Point/year. Both values, therefore, register a decrease as compared to the previous, amounting to 0.05 /Redelivery Point/year.

With Resolution 554/2015/R/gas dated 20th November 2015 ­ "Provisions on gas smart meter commissioning requirements and amendments and supplements to the RTDG" - the AEEGSI updated the obligations and the penalties

envisaged for the commissioning of gas smart meters. With regard to G4 and G6-class smart meters, the measure envisages:

& new commissioning requirements for the years 2016-2017 (15% in operation in 2016 and 33% in operation in 2017) and reduction in the commissioning rate with effect from 31st December 2018 from 60% to 50% for

companies which had more than 200,000 end customers as of 31st December 2013; & a new requirement for the commissioning of 33% of smart meters commencing 31st December 2018 for companies
with a number of end customers between 100,000 and 200,000 as of 31st December 2014;

& a new requirement for the commissioning of 8% of smart meters commencing 31st December 2018 for companies

with a number of end customers between 50,000 and 100,000 as of 31st December 2015;

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

28

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
& that the distribution companies cannot use the remote management of the solenoid valve until the end of the year following the year of commissioning.
As far as G10-class smart meters are concerned, the resolution provides for the commissioning of 100% of meters by 31st December 2018 (50% in operation as of 31st December 2016 and 85% by 31st December 2017). With regard to the calculation of penalties in cases where the objectives have not been achieved: & for smart meters lower than G40, a 2% attenuation of the penalty has been introduced; & G16-G25 classes are understood as belonging to a single class, applying a penalty of Euro 17.00 per unit.

With Resolution 583/2015/R/gas dated 2nd December 2015, the AEEGSI approved the criteria for determining and updating the rate of return on invested capital for infrastructure services of the electricity and gas sectors (2016-2021 TIWACC ), which are applied in the period 1st January 2016 - 31st December 2021. The resolution defines the methods for determining and updating the rate of return on invested capital (WACC) for the infrastructure services of the electricity and gas sectors, unifying all parameters except those that are specific to individual services, including the b parameter, which expresses the specific non-diversifiable risk level of a single service, and the weight of equity and debt capital employed for the weighting (D/E ratio). The revision of the method has been proposed in order to establish a more transparent and predictable regulatory framework, while ensuring uniformity in the WACC calculation criteria and avoiding that differences in the rates of return of individual infrastructure services regulated in the two sectors depend on the specific conditions of the financial markets in the period considered for determining the rate of return on risk-free activities. The resolution establishes that the regulatory period of the rate of return on invested capital for the infrastructure services of the electricity and gas sectors (PWACC) is six years (2016-2012), and envisages an update mechanism - at mid-year - that, in a predictable and transparent manner, allows adjustments in the rate based on the economic trend. With the measure, the Authority has approved the Annex listing the "Criteria for determining and updating the rate of return on invested capital for infrastructure services of the electricity and gas sectors for the period 2016-2021 (TIWACC 2016-2021)" and, in order to ensure consistency with the current regulations for the gas sector, it has changed the provision for the determination of the re-gasification (RTRG), transport (RTTG), distribution (RTDG) and storage (RTSG) tariffs, in connection with the methods for determining and updating the WACC. The TIWACC, in particular, contains the formula for determining the WACC and its updating, considering the various parameters that make it up: the real rate of return on equity (based on the rate of return on risk-free activities, the level of inflation, the total market return (TMR) and the country risk premium (CRP); the effective cost of debt; the theoretical rate of incidence of taxes on the profit for the year; the tax rate for the calculation of the tax shield of the financial charges; the gearing level for the regulated infrastructure service; the adjustment factor to cover taxes on nominal profits. In addition, it identifies the specific parameters of the different services with reference to the gearing level (the ratio of debt capital and the sum of equity and debt capital) and the b parameter (the measure of systematic risk nondiversifiable for each service) in force since 1st January 2016 (with the exception of b parameters related to the electricity sector, that will be determined shortly in the context of the review of the regulatory period). The Attachment therefore contains the tables with the specific values of the basic WACC parameters, the gearing level, the b parameter and the WACC. The new criteria are applied since 1st January 2016 until 31st December 2021. In order to implement the new method, in the three-year period 2016-2019, the WACC is set at 6.1% for the natural gas

distribution activity and at 6.6% for gas measurement activities.

With Resolution 627/2015/R/com dated 17th December 2015, the AEEGSI defined the procedure according to which delinquency charges shall be recognised separately for the sector of electricity and natural gas and for the sector of the integrated water service with reference to supplies intended for the populations affected by the earthquakes occurred on 20th May 2012 and the following days.

Other provisions of the Electricity Sector

With Resolution 161/2015/R/eel dated 9th April 2015 ­ "Amendments to the provisions of Annex A of AEEGSI Resolution 398/2014/R/eel in relation to the collection of measurement data upon the transfer of electricity contracts"the AEEGSI introduced new obligations for the distribution companies, including: & the obligation to record measurement data at the date of contract activation for each non-hourly POD, also through
the repetition of acquisition attempts; & the obligation to repeat the attempt to acquire the measurement data within the deadline envisaged for providing
the data if the record attempt at the date of contract activation is unsuccessful; & the obligation to process the measurement data recorded at the date of contract activation according to the pro
quota die principle; & the obligation to estimate and validate the data in the event of unavailability of the measurement; & the obligation to provide the user of the dispatching associated with the commercial counterparty and
simultaneously the Integrated Information System (SII) with the measurement data recorded within 5 working days of the contract activation date.

With reference to the consultation pursuant to DCO 259/2015/R/eel, with Resolution 402/2015/R/eel dated 30th July 2015 - "Regulations on the management of measurement data in the Integrated Information System with reference to the pick-up points not handled on an hourly basis" - the AEEGSI ordered the start of the probationary period for making available through the SII the flows containing the non-hourly measurement data transmitted by the distribution companies, according to the terms and deadlines established by the Integrated Text of the provisions for the supply of the electricity metering service (TIME).

Resolution 419/2015/R/eel dated 6th August 2015 - "Entry into force of the process for the transfer of electricity contracts within the Integrated Information System for the electricity sector" - established that, with effect from 1st January 2015, the process for the transfer of electricity contracts shall be managed definitively within the SII. This process started subsequent to an experimentation phase implemented between April and July 2015, during which the proper functioning of the process and the reliability of the SII were tested.

Following the feedback received as concerns the consultation of Resolution 547/2013/R/com, the AEEGSI, with

Resolution 487/2015/R/eel - "Reform of the switching process in the electricity retail market" - has defined the switching process through the use of the SII in the event of active pick-up points, together with the management of contract resolution and the activation of services of last resort.

Please find below the main innovations introduced by the measure:

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

30

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
& the amendment to the market structure according to which the SII is in charge of the switching, both in the event of change of provider and activation of last resort services;
& the reduction in switching time: it will be possible to apply for switching, which will be effective on the first day of the month, up to the 10th day of the previous month;
& the definition of a single process, with undifferentiated timing, both in the case in which the Seller decides to make use of conditional switching, and in the case in which the Seller decides not to use it;
& confirmation that the distributor is responsible for providing the measurement data and the data necessary to start the supply, as well as the outcomes of the powering-up and powering-down of PODs.
Finally, the measure defines the process implementation schedule and the deadline for the definitive entry into force of the reform, envisaging a first phase for testing the proper operation of the process, subsequent to which, commencing 1st May 2016, the switching related to non-domestic end customers will be managed by the SII and, commencing 1st June 2016, the switching related to all customers will be managed by the SII.

Following the guidelines set out in DCO 547/2013/R/com on the reform of the processes necessary for the management of end customers within the SII, as well as the provisions of resolutions 98/2014/R/eel and 487/2015/R/eel, which have defined, respectively, the provisions for the implementation and management of the switching and transfer processes for the electricity sector in the SII, with Resolution 628/2015/R/eel dated 17th December 2015 - "Provisions concerning the extension and update of the data contained in the Official central registry of the Integrated information system, with reference to the electricity sector" - the AEEGSI extended and updated the information content of the Official central registry (RCU). In particular, the update mode of the data in the RCU has been redefined and the content of the data associated with each pick-up point has been standardised. The purpose of the resolution is to simplify the exchange of information related to contract termination, the provision of the data necessary to start the supply and the activation of the protected category services managed in the switching and transfer processes within the SII. The new data update mode will be active with effect from 1st October 2016.

Following a lengthy consultation process that has entailed the publication of the documents 5/2015/R/eel,

48/2015/R/eel, 415/2015/R/eel and 544/2015/R/eel, the Regulator with Resolution 646/2015/R/eel dated 22nd

December 2015 approved the "Integrated Text of the output-based regulation of electricity distribution and metering

services for the 2016-2023 regulatory period" (new TIQE), effective from 1st January 2016.

The AEEGSI has established that the previous TIQE (2012-2015 regulatory period), will continue to apply until 1st

January 2017 if necessary for the implementation of the new TIQE and as regards the items pertaining to the year 2015

relating to the adjustment of the bonuses-penalties based on the duration and number of outages without prior notice, as

well as the individual adjustment for MV users and prolonged or extended outages.

The new TIQE is composed of three parts:

Part I ­ Regulation of service continuity and voltage quality;

Part II ­ Regulation of specific and general commercial quality levels;

Part III ­ Selective promotion of investments in the distribution networks.

The main innovations introduced by the Text, as regards the sales companies, are the following:

- faster implementation of services requested by customers regarding estimates and execution of works;

- extension of quick estimate services under the scope of the seller.

With Resolution 86/2015/E/com dated 5th March 2015 ­ "Establishment of the National Register of market operators pursuant to art. 9 of EU Regulation no. 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25th October 2011, on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT)"- the AEEGSI made available, as of 17th March 2015, the national Register of market Operators. This register, set up pursuant to art. 9 of the REMIT - European Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, is available on the Authority's website. The measure requires those operators active in organised wholesale electricity and natural gas markets to register within 7th October 2015.

With Resolution 200/2015/R/com dated 30th April 2015 ­ "Bolletta 2.0: approval of the Glossary and definition of the aggregation level of the amounts billed to end customers served in the protected market. Amendments to Resolution 501/2014/R/com" - the AEEGSI defined the aggregation level of the amounts billed to gas and electricity end customers falling within the scope of the protected market and approved the Glossary of electricity and gas bills. Taking into account the feedback from the consultation 61/2015/R/com, the AEEGSI has also introduced some amendments/additions to the provisions contained in resolution 501/2014/R/com, as concerns "Bolletta 2.0" (the new Bill) and in particular: - it has clarified that Bolletta 2.0 should be applied to all customers classified as households, domestic condos,
entities for public services or other uses, which have an overall annual consumption of less than 200,000 standard cubic meters/year (therefore including multi-site customers); - two additional items have been included in the concise bill: the REMI code and the class of the meter; - further specifications have been defined regarding the recalculations; - some new details about the average cost of supply (definition, calculation and presentation) have been defined; - the methods to illustrate fiscal charges have been clarified in the concise bill, as well as the unit prices in the detailed elements for the protection market. Finally, the entry into force of Bolletta 2.0, originally scheduled for 1st September 2015, has been postponed; the new regulations shall apply to invoices recording consumption of electricity or gas occurred after 1st January 2016.

Subsequent to the feedback arisen from the consultation DCO 477/2014/R/com, with Resolution 258/2015/R/com "First actions against delinquency in the retail electricity and natural gas markets and revision of switching timing in the

natural gas sector" - the AEEGSI modified the regulations concerning arrears in the sectors of electricity and natural

gas, the switching process in the natural gas sector as well as the regulations on payment in instalments. With regard to the regulations concerning arrears, the Gas Delinquency Integrated Text - TIMG (Annex A of

Resolution ARG/gas 99/11) has been amended, while for the electricity sector the new Electricity Delinquency

Integrated Text (TIMOE) has been approved, replacing Annex A of Resolution 04/08. Please find below the detail of the main changes introduced by the measure which, unless otherwise specified, refer to

both sectors:

· Issuance of a formal notice of default The measure clarifies that it is necessary to place in default the customer for all the unpaid bills. In relation to the electricity sector, this clarification is related to the amendment made to the Integrated Text of energy distribution

and metering equipment Quality (TIQE) which specifies that the reactivation following a suspension for arrears is subject to the payment of each invoice that had entailed the request for suspension. The minimum information that

____________________________________________________________________________________________

the formal notice of default should contain, moreover, remains virtually unchanged, except for the fact that it is no longer necessary to explicitly mention the Euro 20,00 compensation. In addition, if in the preceding 90 days a supply suspension request is sent due to non-payment, the payment deadline specified in the letter of formal notice can be halved. · Suspension and interruption capacity (gas sector) if the weekly residual suspension capacity is fully allocated, the Distributor can now offer, since 1st September 2015, an additional suspension capacity. The price of the service cannot in any case be 30% higher than the price of the related closing service. · Interruption of supply (electricity sector) the Resolution has introduced, as for the gas sector, the Interruption of the supply. If suspension is not possible, in cases where the distributor indicates that it is technically and economically feasible to interrupt the POD, the seller/transport user may request the interruption. Before they interrupt the supply, the sellers/commercial counterparts are required to send the customer by registered mail, at least 10 days prior to the request, a communication containing ­ among other things ­ the highest cost estimate for the intervention. · Reactivation following suspension for non-payment in cases where the closing is successful and following the payment by the end customer of the amounts due for all the bills that had entailed the suspension request or a proof of payment, the seller shall immediately request the distributor to reactivate the service. · Automatic compensations in favour of the sellers if the distributor fails to comply with the deadlines for the services, the distributor is now required to compensate the seller/transport user, in proportion to the delay. · Payment in instalments The customers served in the protected market have more time to request payments in instalments pursuant to art. 10 Resolution 229/01 and art. 12Bis of the TIVG. The payment in instalments of the total bill amount may be requested no later than 10 days from the due date; according to the previous regulation, instead, the request had to be filed within the bill due date. · Switching (gas sector) With effect from 1st January 2016, the seller is required to send the distributor the switching request no later than the 10th day of the month prior to the month in which the switching becomes effective and no longer, according to the deadlines provided for by art. 28 of Resolution 138/04, by the 20th day of the second month before the month in which the switching becomes effective. This timing also includes the conditional switching request. In conclusion, the information that the distributor is required to submit to the incoming seller that avails itself of the possibility of exercising the conditional switching have been supplemented. · Supplement to the default service regulations (gas sector) In order to facilitate the legal proceedings aimed at physically powering down the point, the seller is now required to send the distributor the documentation proving the breach of contract by the customer - within 15 days of obtaining the administrative termination for non-payment if the interruption is not possible. · Contractual clauses The seller is required to supplement the contractual clauses with other specific clauses in order to adapt them to the

changes introduced by the measure.

With Resolution 269/2015/R/com dated 4th June 2015 - "Further measures to adapt the code of business conduct and the regulation to the Legislative Decree 21/2014" - the AEEGSI further adapted the current regulations to the new provisions of the Code of Consumption introduced by the national legislature with legislative decree 21/02/2014, no. 21. In particular, the Code of Business Conduct (Annex A, Resolution ARG/com 104/2010) and the Integrated Sales Tex (Annex A, Resolution 301/2012/R/eel ­ TIV) have been amended and further provisions have been introduced concerning the right of withdrawal. The main changes introduced by the measure are the following:
- clarification on how to illustrate the service prices, that can either include or exclude taxes, as long as a specific note is inserted;
- the addition of the pre-contractual information to be provided to the domestic consumer in the event of distance or off-premises agreements and disclosure of the mandatory information;
- definition of the regulations governing the right of withdrawal after the request for the finalisation of the contract;
- as concerns the amounts due to the seller if the right of withdrawal is exercised after the request for the finalisation of the contract, a compensation must include the costs of the supply due for the period between the finalisation of the supply and the termination date.

With Resolution 296/2015/R/com dated 22nd June 2015 ­ "Provisions concerning unbundling obligations for the electricity and gas sectors" - following an extensive consultation process, the AEEGSI approved the new Unbundling Integrated Text ­ TIUF. The most significant innovations were the following: · Notion of vertically integrated company
in accordance with the European Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC and Legislative Decree no. 93/11, a definition of vertically integrated company has been adopted which includes the cases in which control is exercised by individuals or by public bodies that are even non-economic in nature. · Simplification of requirements for operators with less than 100,000 customers Minimum unbundling requirements have been established (appointment of an independent manager, corporate separation) as well as the exemption from the obligation to prepare the Compliance programme, the Annual report on the measures taken and to appoint the compliance supervisor. In addition, it is specified that the corporate scope should be identified on the basis of the total number of redelivery points belonging to the customer served referred to each sector in which the vertically integrated company operates. · Unbundling for operators with more than 100,000 customers The requirements have been strengthened; in addition appointing an independent manager, the companies are also required to appoint a compliance supervisor and to send the AEEGSI each year the Compliance programme. All the distribution companies are required to prepare this programme, regardless of their size. · Separation of the communication policy and brand the obligation presented in DCO 77/2015/R/com has been confirmed. It envisages that the brand and the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

35

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
communication policy shall be separated for the distribution and the sales companies and, as far as the electricity sector is concerned, the separation also applies to the sales companies in the free market with respect to those in the protection market. Not only does the separation obligation affect the brand, but also each distinctive element of the company containing visual, phonetic and conceptual elements suitable to create an association with the sales branch of the vertically integrated company. · Processing of sensitive information Distributors, regardless of their size, are required to process sensitive information confidentially, by making use, where possible, of the instruments made available by the AEEGSI, first of all the SII. · Implementation timing the provisions of the TIUF have immediate effect. At the latest, the companies are required to comply with the new provisions before 1st January 2016. The fulfilment of the obligations regarding brand and communication policies separation shall be guaranteed within 30th June 2016, whereas the obligation to separate the commercial activities related to the distribution companies and the customer interface requirement shall be complied with by 1st January 2017.

With Resolution 330/2015/R/com dated 10th July 2015 ­ "Bolletta 2.0 for the protected market: approval of the guide to the reading of the bill and the criteria for the definition of the concise bill template" - the AEEGSI approved the guide to the reading of the expense items and the criteria for the definition of the concise bill template for electricity and gas customers served in the protected market. The sellers that offer the protection service will be required to publish and update the reading guide on their websites, by reproducing the identical information items published on the Authority's website or, alternatively, by linking the Authority's web page to their websites. In the same resolution the AEEGSI has entrusted the Directorate for consumers, conciliation and arbitration with the creation of a concise bill template, with the clarification that this document is not a facsimile of the bill; the companies are free to design their own layout.

Following DCO 272/2015/R/gas, the AEEGSI, with Resolution 418/2015/R/com dated 6th August 2015 ­ "First

implementations concerning the Integrated Information System for the natural gas sector and changes in the field of

accreditation of the commercial counterparties for the electricity sector" - approved the first implementations in the

field of accreditation to the Integrated Information System (SII) of the commercial counterparties for the gas sector, as

well as the extension of the monthly and annual master data pre-check and management service within the SII.

The resolution above also introduces changes to the accreditation process of the Seller for the electricity sector.

Specifically, the resolution provides that the authorised sellers of natural gas are required to be accredited to the SII in

their capacity as commercial counterparties of the end customer with effect from 1st December 2015.

The resolution specifies that in cases where the distribution user is different from the commercial counterparty, the

latter is required to update the list of the combinations as a result of switching or activation of Redelivery Points.

On 15th January 2016, the pre-check service, already active in the electricity sector, was extended to the natural gas

sector, while, with effect from 1st July 2016, the SII will communicate to each seller, six days before the end of each

month at the latest, their monthly master data (the list of the points under their scope with reference to the next month,

the relevant data making up the Official Central Register, the list of points no longer under their scope, for the

following month) and by 31st July each year, the annual consumption.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

36

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Another innovation is the possibility for the sellers of querying the SII, as from 1st July 2016, and accessing all the data contained in the Register (RCU), for the points under their scope.

With Resolution 440/2015/E/com dated 17th September 2015 - "Completion of the survey on invoicing of electricity and natural gas supplies to small-sized customers" - the AEEGSI closed the study launched with resolution 542/2013/E/com on the invoicing of electricity and natural gas supplies to small-sized customers. The investigation had been initiated in view of the many complaints filed by the end customers at the energy consumer office regarding invoicing, both as concerns the electricity sector and the natural gas market. The survey was conducted by collecting data and information from sellers and through inspections. The main findings of the verifications have confirmed the existence of a number of critical aspects affecting the entire market, such as: · the presence of non-remote meters in the electricity sector (in the second half of 2013, they were about 2% of the
total, approximately 750,000) and failures in the remote reading for about 4% of those meters that are managed remotely; · measurement data not received within the deadline and high incidence of estimated values; · the fact that the sellers prioritise their billing cycles, even at the expense of the number of bills based on actual consumption; · failure to comply with billing frequency; · the end consumer shows active behaviour in the market, not always adequately appreciated.

With Resolution 507/2015/R/com dated 29th October 2015 - "Application of self-auditing procedures to the unbundling provisions for the electricity and gas sectors" - the AEEGSI clarified the application of the self-auditing procedures with reference to unbundling provisions, reformed by resolution 296/2015/R/com. First of all, it is clarified that the purpose of the self-auditing procedure is to verify if every individual proposal for the application of self-auditing procedures is suitable to validate the fulfilment of the purposes implied in unbundling provisions, as well as to identify certain unbundling obligations or independence requirements for the manager components, in place of which the company may apply the aforementioned procedure. The resolution has also extended until 30th November 2015 the deadline for the submission of procedure proposals by the companies. In addition, the measure also specifies that the companies may also, commencing the submission date, apply the procedures on an experimental basis, and that they may also jointly request temporary exemptions from the provisions of the TIUF, except if these exceptions relate to obligations already provided for in the previous regulation of the TIU or regulations contained in EU and national laws.

With Resolution 522/2015/E/com dated 5th November 2015 - "Start of the procedure for the adoption of the legislation governing alternative dispute resolution procedures for litigations between end-customers and/or end-users and operators, in the sectors under the jurisdiction of the Authority for electricity, gas and water - European ADR" - in implementation of Legislative Decree no. 130/15 which implements Directive 2013/11/EU on alternative dispute resolution for consumers, a procedure was initiated for the adoption of the Regulations on alternative dispute resolution procedures for litigations between operators and end-customers, to be concluded by 30th June 2016. The decree above in fact mandates the attempt to settle the dispute, bestowing on the Authority the power to regulate the procedure with

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

37

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
its own measures.

Following the observations emerged as regards the DCO 468/2014/R/com and 388/2015/R/com, with Resolution 584/2015/R/com dated 4th December 2015 ­ "Approval of additional protection measures for domestic customers benefiting from social bonuses for electricity and/or gas" - the AEEGSI strengthened, commencing 1st July 2016, the regulations on electricity and gas bonuses. This resolution introduces the possibility of requesting payments in instalments in cases of abnormal billing pursuant to art. 12 bis of TIVG also for customers in the free market, and the obligation for the sellers to offer the customers who are entitled to the so-called "social bonus", upon issuing a formal notice of default, the payment in instalments of the unpaid bill, in order to facilitate the payment and avoid the suspension of the supply, without prejudice to any more favourable terms made available by the Sellers.

The AEEGSI, with Resolution 610/2015/R/com dated 11th December 2015 ­ "Bolletta 2.0: Quantification of the discount for electronic bills to customers served in the protected market. Amendments and additions to AEEGSI resolutions 501/2014/R/com and 200/2015/R/com" - besides indicating the discount to be applied to protected customers for the delivery of electronic bills, also introduced amendments and additions to resolution 501/2014/R/com and subsequent amendments and additions. The main changes introduced by the measure are: - integration of the minimum elements to be indicated in the bill (for domestic customers: the committed power
capacity and, for each month, the highest level of power consumed since the provision of data by the distributor and, for other customers, the available power and the committed power capacity if fees are envisaged for the latter; finally, for electrical household customers, at least once a year, the details of the highest levels of power consumed on a monthly basis over the past 12 months); - change in the presentation of the recalculations in the case of multi-site customers, stating that the recalculations may be reported in detail elements provided they are sent together with the concise bill and that the bill invites to acknowledge the detail elements; - confirmation of the introduction of the Rai television license item in the electricity bill, as established under the 2016 Stability Law, and how to charge and present the television license fee; - quantification of the discount for electronic bills for customers served in the protection market (equal to 5.4 /Redelivery Point/year for gas domestic customers, 12 /Redelivery Point/year for condominiums with domestic gas supply, equal to 6.00 /POD/year for electric household customers); - guidelines for the application and presentation of the discount for electronic bills, which shall be applied commencing 1st January 2016 to all customers served in the protected market that have activated an automatic debit mode and chosen the electronic issuance of the bill. In the first application stage, the discount may be applied no later than the 6th bill issued after 1st January 2016, in case of invoicing on a monthly basis, and by the 4th bill issued after 1st January 2015 in the event of invoicing with a frequency other than monthly. - update of expense item aggregation tables with the introduction of the discount (where applicable) under the heading "Expense for electricity/natural gas"; - changes and amendments to the texts of the Glossaries as a result of the changes introduced by the measure. In conclusion, by the same resolution, the AEEGSI has initiated a procedure, to be completed by 30th June 2016, aimed at clarifying the regulations governing the discount system, which envisages the automatic adoption of the electronic bill format for the customers who have already activated the automatic debit of the amount billed.

Efficiency and energy saving obligations according to Legislative Decree 102/2014

Legislative Decree no. 102/2014 on energy efficiency requires certain types of companies (large companies and enterprises with high energy consumption, so-called "energy-intensive") to perform an energy audit in accordance with Annex 2 to the Decree above. Ascopiave S.p.A., falling into the definition of a "Large multi-site enterprise", has performed the audit of the group, thus complying with legal obligations.

The energy audit allows a thorough knowledge about the energy use and consumption of the plants being examined, in order to identify the most effective changes; the audit is therefore the necessary condition to start reducing energy consumption in end usage, by identifying, modifying and managing the least energy efficient activities through the evaluation of possible margins of achievable savings. To do this, it is necessary to identify appropriate energy indicators based on the analysis of the data collected; these indicators will be used to compare the energy performance of a given company with benchmark indicators, in order to define whether it is necessary to continue pursuing potential improvement measures. The Ascopiave Group, in order to perform the audit, has followed the instructions contained in the ENEA guidelines for the implementation of energy audits in companies pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 102/2014 and contained in Annex 2 to the ministerial clarification of May 2015.

Efficiency and energy saving obligations
The Letta Decree, in article 16, paragraph 4, states that natural gas distribution companies must pursue energy saving objectives and the development of renewable energy sources. The definition of the national quantitative objectives and the criteria for the assessment of the results obtained was requested from the Ministry for Economic Development, in agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and Land Protection, which led to the issue of the ministerial decree of 20th July 2004. With the Decree dated 21st December 2007, the Ministry for Economic Development reviewed and updated the Decree dated 20th July 2004, on the following points: - the 2008 and 2009 objectives were reviewed in the light of an excess of offer of energy efficiency equities recorded
on the market; - the objectives for the three-year period 2010 - 2012 were defined, taking into account the target of reduction of
energy consumption fixed by the action plan as of 2016, equal to 10.86 MTOE; - the efficiency and energy saving obligations for each year following 2007 were extended to distributors who, as of
31st December of two years prior to each year of obligation, connected more than 50,000 end customers to their distribution network.

The energy saving objectives, that count both for natural gas and electric energy distributors, set out by the Decree of 20th July 2004, integrated by the Decree of 21st December 2007, are equal to: - 0.10 Million TOE for the year 2005; - 0.20 Million TOE for the year 2006;

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

40

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
- 0.40 Million TOE for the year 2007; - 1.00 Million TOE for the year 2008; - 1.40 Million TOE for the year 2009; - 1.90 Million TOE for the year 2010; - 2.20 Million TOE for the year 2011; - 2.50 Million TOE for the year 2012.

The fulfilment of energy saving is attested through the distribution of energy efficiency certificates, the so-called 'White Certificates'. In order to fulfil the obligations as specified by the Decree dated 20th July 2004, integrated by the Decree of 21st December 2007, and to thus see their White Certificates recognised, distributors can: - carry out direct interventions to improve the Energy efficiency of technology installed or related methods of use; - acquire the White Certificates directly from third parties, by means of bilateral contracting or through negotiation
in an appropriate market set up at the Electrical Market Administrator (GME).

With Decree dated 28th December 2012, new objectives of annual primary energy savings were defined for the period 2013-2016 for the obliged distributors, and in particular: - 4.6 Mtoe in 2013; - 6.2 Mtoe in 2014; - 6.6 Mtoe in 2015; - 7.6 Mtoe in 2016;

For natural gas distributors the quota of the above-mentioned obligations corresponds to the following white certificates: - 3.04 million white certificates to be achieved in 2014 - 3.49 million white certificates to be achieved in 2015 - 4.28 million white certificates to be achieved in 2016

For years 2013 and 2014, the obligor must deliver a quota at least higher than 50% of its annual obligation that must be compensated in the next two years in order to avoid penalties. For years 2015 and 2016 the minimum value is set at 60% of the obligation, and it is always possible to compensate in the next two years in order to avoid penalties.

In addition, Decree dated 28th December 2012 gave effect to the provisions of Decree 28/2011 which sets that the activities of management, evaluation and savings certification related to energy efficiency projects undertaken as part of the mechanism of white certificates are transferred to the GSE - Gestore dei Servizi Energetici. The Decree also extended to parties other than distribution companies and the Energy Saving Company (so-called ESCO), the opportunity to present projects in order to obtain white certificates.

The companies of the Ascopiave S.p.A. Group and Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., are subject to the obligations set out in Decrees dated 20th July 2004, 21st December 2007 and 28th December 2012, and are obliged to meet the energy saving requirements established annually by the GSE. The GSE has the task of checking that each distributor is in possession of energy efficiency certificates that comply

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

41

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
with the annual objective assigned to it (increased by any additional shares for compensation or updated following the introduction of new national quantity objectives) and of informing the Ministry for Economic Development, the Ministry for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Electric Market Administrator (GME), of all certificates received and the outcome of the inspections. If a distributor does not meet the agreed objective, it could be subjected to an administrative penalty imposed by the Authority, implementing Law no. 481 dated 14th November 1995 and to the indications of decree dated 28th December 2012.
The next targets for the distributors subject to the obligations as regards the period 2017-2020 will be defined by taking into consideration the provisions of the National Energy Strategy and the Legislative Decree 102/2014, but also by evaluating the new operating framework that will be revised soon with the updating of the new guidelines for the mechanism. To this end, the consultation document of the Ministry of Economic Development issued in July 2015 ("Proposals for the upgrading and qualification of the white certificates mechanism") seems to entail a major review of the mechanism, mostly affecting the "tau" coefficient used to correlate the technical life and the useful life of the facilities, but also the controversial concept of additionality and the extension of the scopes of application (see the water sector and electrical networks). White certificates for projects involving the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources will also be revised and it is likely that the evaluation methods of the savings will be adapted to allow the operators to manage them more easily. Also interesting, the chapter on the measures for speculative behaviours such as preventing certain operators from retaining for a long time the certificates they hold in order to increase the exchange value of the certificates themselves. For further information on efficiency and energy saving relating to the companies of the Group, please see paragraph "Efficiency and energy saving".

Significant events during 2015

Shareholders' Meeting held on 23rd April 2015 The Shareholders' Meeting of Ascopiave S.p.A. convened in its ordinary session on 23rd April 2015, chaired by Mr. Fulvio Zugno. During the meeting, the 2014 yearly statement was approved and the Meeting agreed to distribute a dividend of  0.15 per share. The dividend was paid on 13th May 2015 with ex-dividend date on 11th May 2015 (record date on 12th May 2015). Furthermore, the Meeting has approved the remuneration policy of the Company, set out in compliance with Art. 123/3 of the Unified Finance Law, and has authorised a long-term share-based incentive plan for the three 2015 ­ 2017 fiscal periods regarding executives and company administrators. NThe Shareholders' Meeting has also approved a new purchase and sale plan for treasury shares pursuant to Art. 2357 and 2357/3 of the Italian Civil Code, replacing and superseding the previous authorisation dated 24th April 2014. Finally, subsequent to the expiry of the auditing role entrusted in 2005 to the company Reconta Ernst Young, the Meeting decided to appoint the auditing company PriceWaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. as the independent legal auditor for Ascopiave S.p.A. for the period 2015 to 2023.

2015-2017 Long-term incentive plan
On 29th June 2015, the Ascopiave's Board of Directors identified the beneficiaries of the new 2015-2017 Long-term incentive plan (the "Plan"), approved by the Meeting on 23rd April 2015. In compliance with the provisions of the Plan Rules, the Board of Directors decided to specify as beneficiaries of the potential outcomes of the Plan the executive directors of the companies Ascopiave S.p.A and Ascotrade S.p.A, and a number of managers and directors of the Ascopiave Group, based on the relevance of the functions performed.

Robin Tax Since 2016, the companies of the Group are no longer required to pay the additional IRES tax (the so-called Robin Tax), which was declared unconstitutional by judgement no. 10 dated 11th February 2015 issued by the Supreme Court.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Subsequent to this judgement, in December 2015 the companies submitted to the relevant offices of Agenzia delle Entrate the requests for the reimbursement of the IRES tax paid for the years 2008 to 2014, totalling  26.6 million, of which  20.8 million attributable to the gas and electricity sales segment.

Other significant events during the period
With Judgement no. 2221/2015, filed on 19th October 2015, the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy rejected the appeal lodged by Ascopiave and other operators against AEEGSI Resolution ARG/gas 367/2014. As far as the most impactful aspects are concerned, the Judgement has recognised the legitimacy of the asymmetric regulatory solution adopted by AEEGSI, according to which for each municipal installation, the local net invested capital (RAB), recognised to the winner of the territorial tender, will be equal to: - The reimbursement value of the above-mentioned installation, when the new operator differs from the outgoing operator; - The amount currently recognised by virtue of the current municipal concession, if the new operator coincides with the outgoing operator. The symmetric regulatory solution shall only apply for the duration of the first territorial concession.

AEEGSI, by virtue of law no. 481/95, is responsible for monitoring the price levels of natural gas, and for defining the economic conditions for the supply of gas to customers who are entitled to the protection service. The decisions made by AEEGSI as regards such matters may limit the ability of the gas operators to transfer the increases in raw material cost to the final price. The customers entitled to the protection service are households and condominiums with residential purposes consuming less than 200 thousand cubic meters/year. In 2013, the Authority for electricity, gas and water (AEEGSI ­ "Authority") reformed the structure of gas tariffs intended for protected customers in the civil segment with the introduction of the hub indexation of the component to cover the cost of raw material ­ forward prices recorded at the TTF Dutch hub ­ instead of the previous indexation, mostly oil-linked, in a market where hub gas prices were significantly lower than the oil-indexed prices of long-term agreements. In this context, the Authority introduced, with Resolution 447/2013/R/gas, among the compensation instruments for the operators which had signed long-term agreements, an optional mechanism "to promote the renegotiation of long-term procurement agreements". This compensation mechanism, based on the so-called APR (amount pro renegotiation), has two aims: on the one hand it ensures these operators, which had entered into long-term (typically oil-linked) procurement agreements, a gradual transition to the new price system, by offsetting part of the higher long-term procurement costs which are no longer recoverable through the tariff; on the other hand it safeguards protected customers in the event of a trend reversal of gas spot prices and long-term formulas in the three years after the reform. The reference period of the APR mechanism corresponds to the three thermal years 2014/2016. The initial amount of the compensation was decided by the Authority in 2013 for each operator on the basis of the documentation submitted, considering the differential between the average theoretical efficient cost of long-term agreements (so-called Ptop) and the price expressed by the hub market (TTF reference), leaving to the operators' discretion whether or not to adopt it. The Authority has determined (with reference to the volumes of the Ascopiave Group and a forward reading of the price formulas) a maximum total compensation for the three years of validity of the mechanism equal to Euro 11.2 million. The resolution envisaged a financial settlement of the consideration with a proportion, over the three thermal years considered, equal to 40/40/20%. The mechanism involved an updating process

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
of the APR in the three years aimed at confirming the value originally envisaged, or, in the event of reversal of procurement price and spot price, a return to end customers up to 3 times the amount initially defined: about Euro 33.5 million. In particular, the downward trend would have been activated if the long-term procurement price had been lower than the spot price, according to the indicators and procedures set forth in Resolution 447/2013/R/GAS. The Ascopiave Group at first did not adopt the APR mechanism because of unfavourable operating conditions, challenging the measure before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy, requesting a stay. It being understood that the Ascopiave Group did not deem it appropriate to adopt the APR mechanism in the previous two years, even if it had entered into long-term procurement agreements through the associate Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation, and that during the third quarter of 2015 it finalised the renegotiation of the formulas that regulate natural gas procurement prices, the Group decided to reconsider the position originally taken. The evolution of the general conditions of the natural gas market, the effect deriving from the renegotiation of the indexing formulas of the Group's long-term agreement and the reasonable scenarios prepared by the management, have shown that the risk of suffering financial losses caused by the adoption of the aforesaid mechanism is remote. Rather, the same scenarios have highlighted a possible loss of future economic opportunities if the mechanism is not adopted. Given the reasonableness of the scenarios developed, the Group has decided to adopt the APR mechanism and the economic effects resulting from this mechanism will be reported in the financial statements in accordance with the future AEEGSI deliberations on the matter. The Group, even if the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy has rejected the appeal through which the Group had challenged the functioning of the original mechanism for the renegotiation of natural gas long-term procurement agreements, will consider whether to appeal before the Council of State the negative judgement of the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy, in order to protect its legitimate interests.

Sale of natural gas and electric power
The Group sells gas and electricity through the companies Ascotrade S.p.A., ASM Set S.r.l., Estenergy S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A., Veritas Energia S.p.A. Pasubio Servizi S.r.l.., Etra Energia S.r.l. and Amgas Blu S.r.l.. The companies ASM Set S.r.l. and Estenergy S.p.A. are consolidated with the equity method.

The gas market Although the trends of the gas market and the oil market are less and less correlated, their prices have both dropped. During 2015, the value of Brent experienced a significant depreciation (from $ 57.50/bbl in January to $ 37.50/bbl in December), the TTF value also decreased (from  23.24/MWh in January to  17.48/MWh in December) and an appreciation of the dollar against the euro was also registered. The supply is still structurally higher than the demand, and in the short to medium term, producers are not expected to reach agreements in order to reduce their production and make the gas market less liquid. Iran, in particular, after the lifting of the economic sanctions on nuclear agreements, will probably increase its production in the coming year. At the same time, the rectified expectations on the growth of emerging economies and the massive investment in renewable sources and in the search for new solutions for energy efficiency contribute to increasing liquidity. Due to this situation, characterised by a rapid decline in prices, the operators in the wholesale market have to manage major issues: they must be very careful and accurate upon formulating and managing their offers, which often become obsolete within a short time, and they must be able to devise appropriate hedging instruments.

Sales of gas to end customers show an increase as compared to 2014, although 2015 is the warmest year since temperatures are recorded. Also for the current thermal year, the Authority has confirmed that the price of the raw material will be linked to the TTF Dutch Hub, the most liquid in Europe, and not to the prices that are formed in the domestic market, which is not mature enough to be used as a valid reference instrument for prices. In relation to the right to join the mechanism for the renegotiation of long-term contracts (AEEGSI Resolution 447/2013/R/gas), following the ruling of the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy which has rejected the appeals filed by several companies involved (including Ascotrade S.p.A.) against the provision issued by the Authority, the Group has decided to formally join the Authority's proposal. This mechanism takes into account the volumes imported for the protected market based on the long-term contracts entered into, according to the annual average in the period 2010-2012. On these volumes, the AEEGSI has established a contribution amounting to 3.26 Euro-cent/cubic meter, providing that if the average "Ptop" import price, in the three-year thermal period 2013-2016, from importers with volumes higher than 10% of the total import, is lower than the price set by the Authority for the protected market, the companies which had joined the mechanism should return to the system an amount equal to the difference between "Ptop" and "Cmem" multiplied by the initial volumes for which the contribution had been granted. The maximum amount to be returned was set up to 3 times the initial contribution received. The appeal by Ascotrade S.p.A. before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy had been filed to challenge the decision to refer to the import contracts of the most active players excluding the contracts of individual operators. During the suspension period, two years after the introduction of the mechanism, however, it was possible to assess that import contracts as a whole had very similar formulations and that any price misalignments arguably cannot create disadvantageous situations as compared to the renegotiation of contracts envisaged by the Authority.

The electricity market Wholesale electricity prices did not record major variations during the year, with the exception of July when, as a result of an exceptional heat wave, there was a surge in consumption subsequent to which prices increased by over 30%. In 2015, the value of the "Pun" rose from  51.10/MWh in January to  55.66/MWh in December. As concerns the regulatory framework, the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water has taken steps to issue a Resolution aimed at eliminating distortions in the tariff structure which penalises highest consumptions and that envisages the removal of the progressive nature of variable fees and the relocation of some charges from variable fees to fixed fees. This measure will be implemented in stages over two years and will become fully operational commencing January 2018. In addition, the Authority has reviewed the "PCV" sales rate relating to customer management costs for the protected market, adapting it to the model of the corresponding component of customer management for the gas protected market (QVD).

Measures of the Authority and the Government intended for the gas sector and the electricity sector The Authority has scheduled for January 2016 the obligation to process bills in compliance with the model envisaged (Bolletta 2.0). According to this template, the bill will include a brief overview of the price through the aggregation of multiple components in a few items, so that customers can better understand costs (such as transport costs, distribution costs, ancillary charges...), as well as costs related to taxes, commercial costs, and costs related to the raw material. The aim is to help end customers better understand the bill and at the same time provide them with the tools to evaluate and compare in a clear and transparent way the offers that the sales companies propose to the end market. This new regulation has significantly affected the operations of the sales companies which, in order to comply with the new

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

49

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
obligations, have often had to introduce new calculation methods in order to provide the average costs required. Since the television license will be included in the bill, some major implementations will be necessary before the end of 2016. This will entail an increase in the operations relating to process management and interface with end customers and the public offices that will require specific reports on such activities. In addition, with the Draft Legislative Act no. 2085 on the full liberalisation of the electricity and gas retail markets, a heated debate has sparked off between the Associations of the sales companies and the Committee appointed by the Government: the Associations have expressed their preference for the full liberalisation since they believe that the markets are mature and can take on this challenge, whereas the Authority is proposing further intermediate steps to gradually reach the full liberalisation of the markets.

Ascopiave Group: Management trend
The volumes of gas sold to the final market in 2015 by 100% consolidated companies are equal to 818.6 million cu.m., marking an increase of 7.3% as compared to 2014. To these volumes we have to sum the volumes sold by the proportionally consolidated companies (Estenergy S.p.A. and ASM Set S.r.l.), which in 2015 totally sold 291.2 million cu.m. of gas (+13.9% compared to the previous year). With regard to the electricity sale activity, in 2015 the amount of electricity sold by the 100% consolidated companies was equal to 352.4 GWh, marking a decrease of 7.6% as compared to 2014. To these volumes we have to sum the volumes sold by the proportionally consolidated companies (Estenergy S.p.A. and ASM Set S.r.l.), which in 2015 totally sold 116.7 Gwh, marking a decrease of -27.1% as compared to 2014.

Distribution of natural gas
The Group is active in the gas distribution sector through the companies Ascopiave S.p.A., ASM DG S.r.l., Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. and Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l.. The company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. Is consolidated with the equity method.

Activity of distribution of natural gas
Ascopiave S.p.A. In 2015, the process revision and refinement continued, with the aim of reducing operating costs, implementing actions and increasing the capacity to produce value with internal resources. The purpose is to create the best possible conditions to confront our competitors in terms of management efficiency with a view to the invitations of the territorial tenders.

In this perspective, in late 2014, the Work Force Management system in support of the workforce for field activities has become fully operational. This system has allowed the Group to pursue the optimization of operational resources, through a better planning of the activities. The final balance of the work orders directly from the tablet provided to the operating staff has entailed significant savings in terms of back office activity, and even an improvement of the service offered. The improvement in the management of assets on behalf of the sales companies and end customers has allowed a significant improvement in service quality standards, entailing a decrease of over 30% in the number of services performed below the benchmarks set by the AEEGSI and in the amounts of the compensations offered to end

customers.

During the year, the functional integration with other distribution subsidiaries was increased, in particular as concerns the integration of emergency structures and operational support in the operating activities of Edigas and ASM DG. The full integration of distribution activities with ASM DG has allowed us to further streamline the operational headquarters and close the headquarters in Porto Viro (Rovigo).

The workload required to meet the requests of the municipalities for the provision of the states of consistency of plants and the determination of the RIV (residual industrial values) was particularly significant. All the requests received were processed within the time limit allowed by laws in force.

In compliance with the provisions of the AEEGSI, the renewal process of the meters with the achievement of all major objectives envisaged by current regulations has continued. In this context, since the second half of the year, pilot projects have been launched to test the 169 MHz technology in mass market meters, as an alternative to the "point to point" technology, thanks to the effective collaboration of several municipalities that have joined our initiative by providing sites for the installation of equipment for the reception of metering data (concentrators). During 2015, over 35,000 electronic meters were installed, using entirely in-house operating resources.

With reference to the activities of extension and enhancement of distribution networks and plants, over 83 km of network were installed, with an increase over the previous year amounting to about 25%. At the same time, the specialised unit has built almost one hundred reduction stations, greatly reducing the need for outsourcing. All the design and project management activities for the construction of distribution networks and systems were performed by internal resources.

During the year, we performed extraordinary maintenance interventions, which had been planned to overcome the gradual obsolescence of the plants and improve the transmission capacity of the networks. At the major reduction and measurement stations, we have also completed activities aimed at enhancing the efficiency of preheating systems which will reduce the conditioning costs of the gas introduced into the network. In 2015 as well, the schedule of operation and maintenance activities was respected, and performed almost exclusively by internal staff, only minimally using third-party companies.

In 2015, the emergency service carried out over 5,000 interventions with times of arrival largely lower than the 60 minutes envisaged by the AEEGSI resolution.

In 2015, 90% of the distribution network was inspected to reduce the risks deriving from uncontrolled gas leakages caused by damage to the plants. The activity carried out was mainly performed by internal resources, largely meets the minimum standards required by the AEEGSI and reflects the particular attention paid to the issue of service security.

ASM DG S.r.l. ASM DG S.r.l. manages the gas distribution network in the municipality of Rovigo thanks to the use of management tools and procedure made available by the Parent Company Ascopiave S.p.A.. Important synergies with the Parent

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Company Ascopiave S.p.A and the other companies of the Group, are implemented in all administrative and technical activities, as well as in those regarding process control and HR management.

The management of a call-centre service for emergencies is entrusted by all the companies of the Ascopiave group to one single company at the same contractual conditions, with a clear and positive economic outcome and management uniformity. Also emergency activities, essential for the safe operation of gas distribution systems, are managed with the parent company, which has allowed us to better assess the most critical or dangerous situations.

Activities concerning design, estimate calculation and project management for the implementation of new distribution systems are carried out centrally upon request of private customers or by the public administration. In 2015 the investments for the extension, empowering and maintenance of the distribution network were significant: many segments of obsolete city network were replaced and dozens of outdated or deteriorated connections were rebuilt. In addition, the programme started in 2003 to replace cast ducts with hemp and lead joints was completed well ahead of the deadline set by AEEG's total elimination programme. The activity of maintenance of the distribution network and of the plants in order to maintain proper levels of safety, quality and continuity in the service, is partly performed through the intervention of internal personnel and partly using other companies.

The indicators of safety (time of arrival at the place of call for the emergency service, programmed inspection of the network and measurement of the level of odorizing) and continuity (service interruptions) have been maintained efficiently under control, with respect of the obligation of service prefixed by the AEEG. In 2015, the corporate emergency department, open 24/7, 365 days a year, which can be reached through a dedicated toll-free number, performed its interventions; the arrival time was largely lower than 60 minutes. During the year, inspections of the distribution network were carried out, with the aim of reducing risks coming from the uncontrolled leaks of gas due to deterioration or damage to the systems. All the leaks detected were repaired within the standards deadlines set by the Authority. The inspection programme implemented in 2015 was even stricter compared to the requirements of the AEEG, thus clearly showing the commitment and attention paid by ASM DG S.r.l. to safety. Proper odorization of the gas has been periodically monitored. All first stage gas pressure reduction stations use automatic injection systems that allow timely dosage of the odorization contents. Moreover, the checks on odorization amounted to at least twice as many as those provided for by the Authority according to service standards.

Interventions on meters, such as activations, transfers, cancellations, reactivations after delayed payment, to the service of the sales company were carried out in compliance with the standards specified by the company Service Charter, and in a lower time range than the one provided for by the Authority. As concerns the renewal of meters to conform to the AEEG's standards as per resolution 155/08 and subsequent, in 2015, 1,300 meters were brought into compliance, largely meeting the minimum percentages set by the Authority for Electricity and Gas for the year. Overall, 2,570 groups of measure have been adjusted to resolution 155/08.

Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. (hereinafter Edigas DG S.p.A.) manages the gas distribution activity in 27

municipalities in Lombardy, Piedmont and Liguria. In 2015, the investments for the extension, empowering and maintenance of the distribution network were significant. The investments in network extension were concentrated in the Municipality of Albenga, Sabbioneta and Viverone (BI), serving the hamlets along the lake, and the network was extended with a motorway crossing in the Municipality of Alice Castello, in order to remove piping on the overpass. During the year, more than 3.5 km of distribution network were installed, with interventions in 8 municipalities. Moreover, some new stations for cathodic protection were commissioned with related wells in Castellucchio and Tornata and the earthing system in Castellucchio was rebuilt. The company carries out the activity of maintenance of the distribution network and of the plants in order to maintain proper levels of safety, quality and continuity in the service, partly through the intervention of internal personnel and partly using other companies. On first stage decompression systems (so-called Re.Mi.), on final reduction groups (GRF) and on reduction and measurement stations (GRM), preventive and corrective maintenance activities required under the regulations in force are performed for the most part by personnel employed, but also by specialized third-party companies. The Eternit of first stage decompression systems was removed in the Municipalities of Castellucchio and Salussola, and replaced with eco-friendly fibre cement. In 2015, 32 final reduction groups and one intermediate reduction groupunderwent extraordinary maintenance, 11 new final reduction groups were installed to replace obsolete material, the equipment of 6 final reduction stations was fully replaced and 2 new reduction and measurement stations were installed and commissioned.
The indicators of safety (time of arrival at the place of call for the emergency service, programmed inspection of the network and measurement of the level of odorizing) and continuity (service interruptions) were maintained efficiently under control, in full compliance with the obligation of service set by the AEEG Deliberation. In 2015 the company's emergency intervention service, operative 365 days a year, 24/7, carried out its interventions and the arrival time was on average largely less than 60 minutes. In 2015 the network was inspected in order to reduce the risks arising from uncontrolled leakage of gas caused by deteriorations or damages to the equipment. The inspection programme performed (about 662 Km) largely meets and exceeds the minimum standards required by AEEG and this proves the particular attention paid by Edigas DG S.p.A. to the issue of service safety. In 2015 over 162 measurements of the level of odorizing were made (with the gas chromatographic instrumental method) upon maximal and minimal period of supply, and all measurements were compliant with current technical regulations.
Interventions on meters, such as activations, transfers, cancellations, reactivations after delayed payment, to the service of the sales company were carried out in compliance with the required standards. The average time for supply activation and deactivation has been much lower than the maximum national standard. By means of AEEG's resolution no 155/08, Edigas DG S.p.A. has continued its change and normalization policy of the new directives by installing G25 and G16-class meters with electronic readers, replacing during the year 11 G10 meters, expecting to complete this replacement by the next year, and replacing 74 G4 electronic meters as well as 6 flow computers on classes higher than G25.

Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. (hereinafter Unigas S.r.l.) manages the gas distribution activity in 32 municipalities of the district of Bergamo. Network development activities are planned and coordinated by the main headquarters located in Nembro. Activities of planning, prevention and employee management for the implementation of new distribution systems are carried out centrally on the request of private customers or by the public administration. The central technical structure has a cartography and calculation system, which, through the creation of a fluid-dynamic model of the network's functional parameters, calibrated on seasonal consumption progress, allows the constant prediction of the effects produced to the network of sudden thermal changes, anomalies, or the insertion of new delivery points. In 2015 the investments for the extension, the empowering and maintenance of distribution network involved 6.3 km, in line with the 2015 budget and the previous years. Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. performs maintenance activities on the distribution systems in order to maintain adequate safety levels, ensure quality and continuity of service, in part through the work of internal personnel, and in part using third-party services. On the first stage decompression systems (so-called Re.Mi.), on final reduction (GRF) and on reduction and measurement stations (GRM), preventive and corrective maintenance required under the regulations in force are performed for the most part by internal staff. With the aim of controlling the correct operation of plants and of reducing the probability of damage or malfunction, ordinary maintenance is carried out through operations of Programmed Preventive Maintenance (MPP), i.e. partial or total disassembly of the apparatus, cleaning, control of the component parts and replacement of the parts subjected to wear and tear and of Functional Verification. In 2015, 29 Functional Verifications, 34 Inspections, and 5 Planned Maintenance Actions were performed (by internal personnel. The first stage decompression systems were verified by in-house staff for a total of about 36 checks for every single station during the year. As regards to GRFs, 150 Functional Verifications, 169 Inspections and 24 planned maintenance actions were carried out. In 2015, 1 new final reduction group and 2 GRM were activated ­ at the same time, following the design inspections performed, 10 final reduction groups were removed because they did not affect the efficacy of distribution. As regards cathodic protection, during 2015, 4 new systems were installed. The quadrennial checks for earthing systems were also performed. The indicators of safety (time of arrival at the place of call for the emergency service, programmed inspection of the network and measurement of the level of odorizing) and continuity (service interruptions) have been maintained efficiently under control, in full compliance with the obligation of service set by the AEEG Deliberation.

The company's emergency intervention service can be contacted by means of the dedicated free-phone number, active 365 days a year, 24/7 and managed by Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. In 2015, 936 interventions were performed, and the average arrival time was largely below the average time set by the Authority (60 minutes). In total the calls received by the call centre were 3,283 (slightly decreasing with respect to 3,668 of the previous year) of which 1,111 calls were handled and 1,462 did not concern reasons attributable to emergency intervention. Over the course of 2015, inspection of approximately 44% of the distribution network was carried out, with the aim of reducing risks coming from the uncontrolled loss of gas due to deterioration or damage to the systems. The inspection program carried out exceeds the minimum standards required by the AEEG for distribution systems, and demonstrates the attention paid by Unigas to the safety of its services.

In particular, 94 Km of medium-pressure distribution network and 357 Km of low-pressure distribution network were inspected, and 29 leakages were removed on the networks and underground connections to users. In 2015, an extraordinary activity was planned, with in-house staff, for the scheduled inspection of overhead connections to users and measurement systems for the plants in Nembro and Ponte San Pietro. This activity has led to the identification of 132 leakages, all removed during the year. Proper odorization of the gas is monitored on a monthly basis. Measurements of the level of odorizing were made (with the gas chromatographic instrumental method) in the moment of maximal and minimal period of supply; all measurements suited the current technical norms.
The activities carried out on the counting metres, supplied exclusively by the accredited trading companies, are subject to the specific standards identified in the Service Charter and are the following: new activations, transfers, cancellations, reactivations. The services supplied in 2015 are in line with those supplied in the previous years. The services were carried out in accordance with the standards identified in the corporate Service Charter. In 2015, the activity performed in 2014 for arrearage is confirmed. Over the year, the plan to adjust meters concerning resolution 631/13 by completing the replacement of G16 and G25 meters and 45% of G10 meters through the installation of remote-reading devices and systems with a dedicated modem and battery continued.
Ascopiave Group: management trend
In 2015, the volumes of natural gas distributed through the networks managed by the Group were 859.3 million cu.m.4, of which 682.1 million cu.m. by the company Ascopiave S.pA., 47.7 million cu.m. by ASM DG S.r.l., 58.8 million cu.m.c by Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. And 70.8 million cu.m. by Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. (proportionally consolidated company of which the Group owns a share equal to: 48.86. The distribution network, as a consequence of new extensions in 2015 and considering the variations of managed concessions portfolio, as at 31st December 2015 has an extension of over 8,300 km (8,200 km in 2014)4.
Co-generation
In 2015 the co-generation activity of the Ascopiave Group S.p.A. was carried out by the Research and Development Department. As far as the activity of heat generation plants in co-generation is concerned, in 2015 four plants were managed. The plant "Le Cime" in Mirano (VE) has not been modified and its remote heating network has not been extended but its saturation level of connected household customers has increased from 79% to 85%. On the plant there is an on-going leasing agreement. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected clients and in summer to supply the absorber for the production of cooling for air conditioning of connected users.

4 The data specified as regards the length of the distribution network and the volumes of gas sold are obtained by adding each Group
company's data, previously pondering the data of the companies consolidated with the equity method.

The plant "Bella Mirano" in Mirano (VE) has registered an increase in saturation for household clients connected to the network (from 105% to 113%). The saturation above 100% is due to the fact that, in addition to the original project, in 2014 two new condos were connected to the remote heating network, which did not belong to the initial project, but connected subsequent to a contribution which fully covers the costs, paid by the builders of the two new condominiums. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected clients. The saturation for the connected household clients of the plant "Ca' Tron" in Dolo (VE) has increased from 29% to 31%. It is however specified that as of today only 50% of the new urban area envisaged in the agreement has been built. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected clients. The plant "Ponte Teresa" in Ponte Teresa (VA) did not register significant variations in saturation for the connected household clients The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected clients. As far as the activities on thermal plants are concerned, in 2015 Ascopiave S.p.A managed some ten plants.

Efficiency and energy saving
In order to meet the energy saving requirements specified by Decree dated 20th July 2004, in 2006 and 2007 Ascopiave realised the following two projects (the second in several phases):

- The installation of thermoregulation and computerized management tools in public buildings; - Distribution of florescent light bulbs for electrical energy savings and a kit including a low-flow shower head
and a low-flow tap to save hot water to all of its domestic clients.

The project on remote management was concluded in 2009, whereas the main one, relating to the distribution of the energy saving kit, ended in the first semester 2010, with the assignment of about 5,000 certificates. In 2015, Ascopiave decided to resume the implementation of projects to obtain the certificates and to this end it submitted a request to enhance the efficiency of gas preheating systems for the distribution network. In order to fulfil its current and future need, Ascopiave S.p.A. will have to realize new projects of energy saving and buy certificates on the market. With Resolution AEEG EEN 9/11 issued on 27th October 2011, the new guidelines for the energy efficiency market were established, which also provide for an adjustment of the certificates to the useful life of the project. This should support the offer of certificates, which is still below the expectations of the targets set for distributors. The 2014 objective of 79,326 Energy Efficiency Certificates has been reached. As concerns 2015, Ascopiave S.p.A. received a communication from GSE which quantifies an obligation of 84,057 white certificates, to be delivered by 31st May 2016.

The company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l.. in 2015 as well had to purchase white certificates on the market or through bilateral transactions in order to fulfil its energy saving obligations equal to 16,518 Energy Efficiency Certificates, and submitted just over 50 (8,485 EECs). The remaining quota of the Energy Efficiency Certificates falling within the 2013 target (6,315 Energy Efficiency Certificates) was cancelled. The GSE determined a 2015 target for Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l equal to 19,116 EECs to be delivered by 31st May 2016.

Subscription, with the Municipalities involved, of a convention for the adoption of a shared procedure aimed at the agreed quantification of the "Residual Industrial Value" of the networks.

The regulatory amendments which have replaced each other over the past years and in particular the legislation which provided for the selection of the operator of the distribution service through the so-called "territorial calls for tenders" tool, have led to, among other things, the need to determine the Residual Industrial Value (RIV) of the plants owned by the Operators. Normally, in relation to this aspect, the concession agreements governed two "paradigmatic" situations, namely:
· the early redemption (normally governed with reference to Royal Decree no. 2578/1925) and · the reimbursement from the (natural) expiration of the concession. The eventuality of a "force of law" expiration, preceding the effective date of the "contractual" expiration, (as a rule) was not envisaged (and therefore governed) in the concession deeds.
Substantially, the case in question (earlier termination imposed by law) represents a "third category", in some ways similar to the exercise of early redemption (from which, however, it differs significantly for the lack of a will independently formed to that effect by the Body) and in other ways similar to the expiration of the concession term (which however has not expired).
At least until Ministerial Decree 226/2011, there were no legislative and/or regulatory norms which precisely defined the methods and criteria to determine the R.I.V. of the plants and which could therefore complement the contractual clauses, often deficient.
Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 as well, until the recent amendment introduced in the first place with Law Decree 145/2013, and then Law 9/2015, merely referred to Royal Decree 2578/1925 which, however, ratified the method of the industrial estimate without setting precise assessment parameters.
The situation illustrated above entailed the necessity to define specific agreements with the Municipalities aimed at reaching a shared estimate of the R.I.V.. Just consider that the lack of such agreements in the past has often led to administrative and civil/arbitral litigations. The situation of the Municipalities partners of Asco Holding S.p.A. was even more peculiar in the sense that, with the latter, there is not a real concession deed in "canonical" form, but various deeds of assignment to Companies ("Azienda Speciale", at the time). These deeds have ratified, at the same time, the continuation of the award of the service previously provided by the Bim Piave Consortium.
It is evident that, as deeds of assignment, a real regulation concerning the purchase and/or the termination of the management was not and could not be envisaged.
With the above-mentioned partner Municipalities, Ascopiave has signed a convention which implied hiring a renown independent competent professional in order for him to determine the fundamental criteria to apply to calculate the RIV of the gas distribution plants. The related negotiated procedure performed adopting the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender ended on 29th August 2011.
The expert has written a report on the "Fundamental criteria to calculate the RIV of the natural gas distribution plants

located in the Municipalities currently serviced by Ascopiave S.p.A." which was approved on 2nd Dec. 2011 by Ascopiave's Board of Directors and then by all 92 Local Bodies by City Council Resolution. In 2013 Ascopiave submitted the state of consistency and the appreciation of the plants determined applying the criteria set in the Report, offering at the same time its willingness to perform the cross-examination with the Municipalities, aimed at analysing the documents. To date, following the outcome of the technical cross-examination, 87 Municipalities (unchanged since 31st December 2014) have approved the residual value. As part of the above process, the reciprocal relations mostly connected to the management of the service were governed as well, since both the payment of "one-off" amounts (2010 ­ signature of supplementary deeds) for Euro 3,869, and (since 2011) real fees for variable amounts and equal to the difference, if positive, between 30% of the "restriction on revenues" recognized by the tariff regulation and the amount already received by the Municipality itself as a dividend in 2009 (financial statements 2008) are envisaged.
In particular: · Euro 3,869 thousand in 2010; · Euro 4,993 thousand in 2011; · Euro 5,253 thousand in 2012; · Euro 5,585 thousand in 2013; · Euro 5,268 thousand in 2014; · Euro 5,258 thousand in 2015.
were paid for a total amount of Euro 30,226 thousand.
During 2015, Ascopiave S.p.A. made available to the Municipalities belonging to the Minimum Territorial Areas of Treviso 2 - Nord and Venezia 2 ­ Entroterra and Veneto Orientale (69 municipalities out of 92), an update of the valuations of the plants as of 31st December 2014, by applying the valuation criteria agreed upon and by providing a calculation of the assessment of private contributions to be deducted from the residual industrial value pursuant to Law 9/2014.

Litigations
CLASS I ­ ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS As of 31st December 2015, as far as concessions are concerned, no administrative litigations are pending.

CLASS II ­ LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS - CIVIL LAW As of 31st December 2015, the following litigations are pending:

MUNICIPALITY OF CREAZZO: A trial is pending between Ascopiave and the Municipality of Creazzo for the establishment of the industrial residual value of the distribution plants (delivered in 2005 to the new operator) following the result of the previous Judgement, with respect to which the Court of Appeal of Venice, with Judgement no. 2178/15, has accepted the appeal of the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

58

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Municipality, ratifying the validity of the arbitral clause set forth in the original Agreement, thereby cancelling the Judgement of the Court of First Instance dated 25th August 2014, by which the Single Judge sentenced the Municipality to pay an amount of Euro 1,678 thousand. Although the Group hopes to reach a settlement agreement, with a conservative approach aimed at avoiding the expiry subsequent to Judgement 2178, on 11th December 2015, Ascopiave S.p.A. gave a Notification of Litigation to start the Arbitration procedure.

CATEGORY III ­ LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS - ARBITRATIONS As of 31st December 2015, the following litigations are pending:

MUNICIPALITY OF COSTABISSARA: An arbitration is pending between Ascopiave and the Municipality of Costabissara for the establishment of the industrial residual value of the distribution plants (delivered in to the new operator during FY 2011). The Arbitration Commission held its first meeting on 16th January 2012. Given the disagreement on this point between the parties, with a partial arbitral award, the Commission has confirmed the enforcement of the same clause. With a final Arbitration award on 25th-26th May 2015, the Commission ordered the Municipality to pay the sum of Euro 3,473 thousand, in addition to the interests at the date of filing the Award. In the same Measure the costs of the procedure were quantified in Euro 210 thousand (plus VAT, Lawyers' social security fund and overheads), two-thirds of which under the scope of the Municipality and one third under the scope of Ascopiave S.p.A.. The Award was declared enforceable by the Court of Vicenza on 7th July 2015. The Municipality, by a deed notified on 12th December 2015, appealed the Award before the Court of Appeal of Venice.

MUNICIPALITY OF SANTORSO: An arbitration is pending between Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Municipality of Santorso for the establishment of the residual industrial value of the distribution plants (delivered in 2007 to the new operator). The start of the procedure was necessary as a result of the Judgement dated 4th September 2013 by which the Judge declared that the Court of Vicenza has no jurisdiction for the validity of the arbitral clause set forth in the original Agreement. Noting the failure of attempts to amicable settlement, on 12th November 2013, Ascopiave S.p.A. served the litigation notice with the appointment of the party Arbitrator. The Municipality, by resolution dated 26th November 2013, appointed its Arbitrator. By decision of the President of the Court of Vicenza dated 31st January 2014 (taken upon request by Ascopiave) the third Arbitrator and the Chairman of the Panel were appointed. The Municipality has contested this procedure (also set forth in the concession agreement) supporting the applicability of the new law dated 2012 which, amending the Public Contracts Code, introduced a peculiar regulation with respect to the arbitration proceedings with the Public Bodies which envisages, among other things, the appointment of the third Arbitrator by the Court of Arbitration of AVCP (Authority for the Supervision of Public Contracts for works, services and supplies). The Authority has adhered to the request, envisaging a retroactive application of the new rule and introducing a sort of supervening invalidity of the arbitral clauses. In this perspective it has scheduled the draw of the third Arbitrator on 17th April. Ascopiave S.p.A. has always expressed its opposition to this formulation (most recently with the note to the AVCP dated 15th April 2014) and therefore considers the Panel perfectly formed, which, moreover, at its meeting held

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

59

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
on 14th April 2014, confirmed its legitimacy. AVCP's Chamber of Arbitration has submitted the extract of the minutes of the meeting held on 17th April 2014 which ratified the acknowledgement of Ascopiave S.p.A.'s communication. As a consequence, the proceeding was declared extinguished. The Municipality's defence has renewed its application to AVCP, while Ascopiave S.p.A.'s lawyer has reaffirmed the position of the Parent Company in another letter dated 12th June 2014. The Panel, in hearings held on 26th June and 7th July dealt with the issue envisaging a partial award on the matter and establishing the deadlines for the Parties' briefs on 30th September 2014 and 15th October 2014. The recent Law Decree 90/2014, whose article 19 has abolished AVCP, could have a significant impact on the matter. The Parties have submitted their respective briefs (and replies) within the specified time limits. With a partial award dated 10th January 2015, the Panel confirmed the legitimacy of its constitution and therefore the full legitimacy to proceed. With order dated 27th February 2015, the Panel set an investigation by a court-appointed expert to determine the value of the plants. The investigations are currently in progress, regarding which, following the request of the court-appointed expert witness, the Chairman of the Panel has extended the original deadline by 45 days. The activities should therefore be completed by 30th November 2015. The court-appointed expert witness has submitted his report within the aforementioned deadline. The report has been strongly contested in detail by the defendant's expert and Ascopiave's attorney. At the hearing held on 21st December 2015, the Panel gave the Parties a time limit for filing a defence (1st February 2016) to respond to the respective notes filed during the hearing, relating to the expert's reports prepared by the courtappointed expert witness. In view of the aforesaid challenges and the subsequent applications filed by the Parties, the Panel has allowed the latter to consult the court-appointed expert witness on 10th March 2016. The expert's operations, therefore, are to be considered not concluded and indeed, still in progress.

CATEGORY IV ­ PENDING ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS - NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2015, the following litigations are pending:

ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. ­ HEADQUARTERS EXTENSION: An appeal before the Council of State filed by the company Setten Genesio S.p.A., for the tender involving the construction of the new company headquarters and aimed at obtaining the review of the sentence no. 6335/2010 issued by the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto that, despite admitting the appeal filed by the company and thereby annulling the tender acts, rejected the request for compensation for damage (for about Euro 1,300 thousand) against Ascopiave and the company Carron S.p.A.. In order to obtain the review of the First Instance Sentence, Ascopiave S.p.A. has filed an incidental appeal. By a communication dated 29th September 2015, however, the Lawyer of the company reported that the Council of State, Section V, scheduled the public Hearing for the discussion of the appeal on 24th November 2015. The main issue will be focused on the claim for damages pursuant to the Criminal Code ( 1,300 thousand), in relation to which the same arguments that led to the non-acceptance in the first instance will be proposed again. Although the company hopes

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

60

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
for a similar outcome, the risk of a partial acceptance and therefore a sentence, at least on a lump-sum basis, cannot be neglected. The judgement is pending. With Judgement no. 275/2016 dated 27th January 2016, the Council of State allowed the interlocutory appeal filed by Ascopiave and therefore rejected both the main appeal and the request for compensation (Euro 1,300,000) submitted by Setten Genesio, without prejudice to the compensation of legal costs. As a consequence, Ascopiave is not indebted to Setten Genesio.

AEEGSI ­ RESOLUTION ARG/GAS 241/2013 ­ 533/2013: An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Latium, which overrules Ministerial Decree dated 5th February 2013 approving the agreement template for managing the service subsequent to the following calls, limiting to the last part of art. 21.3 where the manager "supplies the default service according to the methods defined by the Authority." This is a merely precautionary measure aiming at avoiding the risk of lack of interest in the aforesaid main judgement. Given the merely instrumental nature and Judgement issued on 6th December 2014, by which the Council of State allowed the appeal filed by AEEGSI and, as a consequence, cancelled the Judgement issued by the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy no. 3272 of 28th December 2012, the Proceedings will not be carried on.

With appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy Milan, Resolution 241/2013 was contested as well. The main reasons are: failure to envisage a compensation for the default service interventions in progress; the provisions concerning delay penalties or failure to implement power failure to be paid by the distributor even if the delay or the failure to implement depend on causes not attributable to the distributor. Finally, in connection with previous appeals (pending at that time), the "motivation" given to the provision was contested: according to the AEEGSI, this motivation only derives from the need to obviate a sort of "incompetence" of the distributors. AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, with Resolutions 533/2013 and 84/2014. On 21st January 2014 an appeal was filed against Resolution 533/2013 before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy Milan. The reasons are similar to those that led to appeal Resolution 241/2013. In early-March 2015, it was disclosed that, with judgements no. 593 and 594/2015, the Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals of 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. and Italgas against the same resolutions 241/2013 and 533/2013. The interest in the judgement has somewhat diminished because the regulatory environment has been profoundly changed by the subsequent numerous legislative measures and there is therefore a need to evaluate other judgements with respect to the proceeding brought by other companies in the sector.

AEEGSI ­ RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 28/12 ­ 193/12 ­ 246/12 ­ 631/2013: An appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan, against the Authority for Electricity and Gas for cancelling Resolution ARG/gas 28/12, relating to the change from traditional meters to electronic meters, remotely read and managed; in particular: for the failure to recognize the residual value of the replaced meters still having a valid seal; for the wrong (underestimated) indication/recognition of standard costs for the new appliances; for the obligation to use electronic meters only as from 1st March 2012 in spite of the fact that the technology needed is not yet available at an industrial level. Subsequently, as partial modifications to Resolution 28, the AEEGSI issued Resolutions 93/2012 and 246/2012, which, however, were not sufficient to withdraw the company's complaint. The deadline set on 1st March 2012 was cancelled and postponed to 31st December 2012. The company has filed an appeal against both resolutions with additional

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

61

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
grounds. Similarly, Resolution 316/2012 through which the AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, has also been contested. With Resolution 631/2013 the AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, amending Resolution 28/2012. Therefore, the new stay request, submitted with reference to the previous rules, (also contested) was withdrawn. The proceedings are formally still in progress; however, by virtue of Resolution 631, they should/could be considered without further legal interest.
GUIDELINES ­ MINISTERIAL DECREE 22ND MAY 2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Latium ­ Rome against the Minister of Economic Development for the cancellation of Ministerial Decree dated 22nd May 2014 concerning the introduction of Guidelines for the determination of the residual industrial value. As part of the same proceedings, the issues of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling as concerns Law 9 and 116 of 2014, in the section which has modified art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (retrospective deduction of private contributions and time limit of agreements' validity) were raised. The Regional Administrative Court, with reference to the appeals filed by other Distributors including an application for suspension, has scheduled the hearing on 27th June 2015. Ascopiave S.p.A.'s lawyers will request that the proceedings are discussed during the same hearing, or another one to be scheduled. The Court has ordered the postponement of the discussion to another Hearing to be scheduled subsequent to the entry into force (29th July 2015) of Ministerial Decree no. 106 dated 20th May 2015, amending Decree 226/2011, and its appeal. The Ministerial Decree, in fact, at least as far as art. 5 is concerned, essentially introduces the regulation of the Guidelines into Ministerial Decree 226/2011. On 1st October 2015, Ascopiave actually filed an appeal against the above-mentioned Decree as well, with "additional grounds" with respect to the main appeal. The hearing is scheduled for 28th April 2016.

AEEGSI RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 310/2014 and ARG/GAS 414/2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the AEEGSI, for the cancellation of the Resolutions ARG/gas 310 and 414/2014 related to the methods for assessing the RAB RIV delta, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (current text) when the difference is higher than 10%. To date, there are no further procedural steps.

AEEGSI RESOLUTION ARG/GAS 367/2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the AEEGSI, for the cancellation of Resolution ARG/gas 367/2014 related to the methods for recognizing the value of the RAB RIV delta in the section which envisages different regulations for incumbent (no reimbursement) and non-incumbent (full reimbursement) winners of the Territorial tender. With Judgement no. 2221/2015 filed on 19th October 2015, the Regional Administrative Court, confirming the previous (already reported) Judgement 1396/2015, rejected the appeal. Ascopiave is currently assessing if an Appeal is appropriate. As far as the most impactful aspects are concerned, the Judgement has recognised the legitimacy of the asymmetric regulatory solution adopted by AEEGSI, according to which for each municipal installation, the local net invested capital (RAB), recognised to the winner of the territorial tender, will be equal to:

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

62

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
- The reimbursement value of the above-mentioned installation, when the new operator differs from the outgoing operator;
- The amount currently recognised by virtue of the current municipal concession, if the new operator coincides with the outgoing operator.
The symmetric regulatory solution shall only apply for the duration of the first territorial concession. With deed notified on 18th January 2016, Ascopiave S.p.A. filed an appeal.
CATEGORY V ­CIVIL LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS
As of 31st December 2015, the following litigations are pending:
ASCOPIAVE ­ UNIT B: A civil Judgement before the Court of Treviso (RG 6941/2013) following the pre-trial technical investigation, which ended with the report of the Expert witness (appointed by the Court), and started by Ascopiave (writ of summons dated 22nd August 2013) in order to obtain compensation for damages to the entrance floor of the "Unit B", against: Bandiera Architetti S.R.L (Designers), Mr. Mario Bertazzon (Contract Manager) and Mr. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali S.R.L. (Contractor). The compensation request refers to an assessment of damage between approximately Euro 127 thousand (Expert witness estimate for full restoration) and Euro 208 thousand (estimate of a Third party firm for full makeover). All the Parties regularly appeared before the Court. Following the third-party notice (Insurance Company and Site engineer) the first hearing is scheduled on 17th April 2014. Upon its completion, the Judge granted the ordinary investigatory period and scheduled the next hearing on 15th July 2014. The Court, by Order dated 22nd December 2014, decided the complete renewal of the expert witness board, appointing an assessor. The appointment was confirmed in the hearing held on 13th March 2015. Ascopiave S.p.A. has appointed its own expert. The experts' investigations are currently in progress and we are awaiting the Final report of the expert witness. Meanwhile, since the "field" operations are basically completed, in order to remedy a situation of degradation and potential danger for Visitors and prior notice to the expert witness, the works to reconstruct the flooring have started.

Relationships with Agenzia delle Entrate (Tax collection agency)

During 2008, the subsidiary company Ascopiave S.p.A. was subject to tax audit by the Regional Inland Revenue Office. Following the audit, a report on findings with observations on the indirect and direct taxes was issued. During the month of July 2008, the local Internal Revenue Office issued a notice of assessment regarding the contents of the report on findings. The company, on 5th February 2010, filed an appeal to the Provincial Tax Commission and paid the sum of Euro 243 thousand following the entry in taxpayers' list while the Judgement is pending. On 30th September 2010 the Tax Commission of the Province of Treviso with judgement 131/03/10 filed on 14th December 2010 accepted the appeal and acknowledged the good tax behaviour of the company. Later, Agenzia delle Entrate filed an appeal against the decision of the Commission of the Province of Treviso. On 24th September 2012, the Regional Provincial Tax Commission issued judgement no. 109/30/12, filed on 20th December 2012 which rejected the appeal submitted by Agenzia delle Entrate.

On 26th June 2013, the company Ascopiave S.p.A. was notified about the appeal in Cassazione (Court of Cassation) by the Inland Revenue Agency and joined proceedings because of the result of previous judgements. The directors, encouraged by the opinion of the professionals consulted, are confident about a positive result of the litigation.

Territorial areas
In 2011, the issuance of a number of ministerial decrees further defined the regulatory framework of the sector, regarding in particular the territorial calls for tenders. Specifically: 1) the Decree dated 19th January 2011 issued by the Ministry for economic Development in agreement with the Ministry for the Relationship with Regions and Territorial Cohesion, the territorial areas for issuing calls for tenders to entrust the gas distribution service were identified; with subsequent Decree dated 18th December 2011, the municipalities belonging to each territorial area were also identified (the so-called Territorial Areas Decree); 2) the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry of Employment and Social Policies on 21st April 2011 contained provisions ruling the social effects connected to the assignment of the new gas distribution concessions, thus implementing paragraph 6 of art. 28 of Legislative Decree no. 164 issued on 23rd May 2000 (the socalled Workforce Protection Decree); 3) with the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development on 12th November 2011, the regulatory norms concerning the criteria to be applied to calls for tenders and the evaluation of the offer for assigning the gas distribution service was approved (the so-called Decree for Criteria). The issuance of ministerial decrees played a major role in giving certainty to the competitive environment within which operators will move in the coming years, thus laying the foundations for allowing the process of market opening - that started with the implementation of European directives - to produce the benefits hoped for. The Ascopiave Group - as indeed many other operators - has substantially appreciated the new regulatory framework, believing that it can create important opportunities of investment and development for medium-sized qualified operators, rationalising the offer. At the end of 2013, the Government issued Law Decree 23/12/2013, no. 145, making changes to the regulatory framework with regard to the determination of the reimbursement value of the plants due to the outgoing operator at the end of the so-called "Transitional Period". The Decree was converted with amendments into Law no. 9 / 2014, which substantially changed the original provisions of the Decree on that aspect. The conversion into Law of the Decree (Law no. 9 / 2014) has made substantial changes to Article 15 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000, providing that the new operators shall pay a reimbursement to the holders of assignments and concessions existing in the transitional period, calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts and, even if not inferable by the will of the Parties and for aspects which are not envisaged in those agreements or contracts, based on guidelines on operating criteria and methods for the assessment of the reimbursement value as per article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98. In any case, private contributions related to local assets (assessed in accordance with the methodology of tariff regulation in force) have to be deducted from the reimbursement value. If the reimbursement value is higher than 10% of the value of local assets calculated as per tariff regulation, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, the granting local body submits the related evaluations detailing the reimbursement value to the Authority for Electricity and Gas and Water Supply System so that it can be checked

before publishing the invitation to tender. In addition, Law no. 9 / 2014 has established that the deadlines envisaged in paragraph 3 of article 4 of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98, are extended by four months and that the deadlines illustrated in Attachment 1 to the regulations of the Minister for Economic Development Decree dated 12th November 2011, no. 226 (so-called "Decree for Criteria"), related to dispositions contained in the third grouping of Attachment 1 itself, and the deadlines illustrated in article 3 of the regulations, are extended by four months. On 6th June 2014 the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development dated 22nd May 2014 was published in the Official Gazette, which approved the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree no. 69 / 2013, converted with amendments by Law no. 98 / 2013 and article 1, paragraph 16, of Law Decree no. 145 / 2013, converted with amendments into Law no. 9 / 2014. Pursuant to Law no. 9 / 2014, the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" define the criteria to be applied to the valuation of reimbursement of facilities in order to integrate those aspects that are not already provided for in the agreements or contracts and what cannot be deduced from the will of the parties.

The "Guidelines; feature several critical issues not only as concerns the resulting valuations, but also in terms of application scope, extremely extended by the Ministry, to the extent that all the agreements regarding the valuations of the facilities entered into by the operators and the Municipalities after 12th February 2012 (date of entry into force of Ministerial Decree 226/2011) are believed to be ineffective.

Furthermore, these Guidelines contrast with the provisions of art. 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011 itself. This is in non-compliance with the provision of law which refers to art. 4, paragraph 6 of Law Decree 69/2013, which, in turn, makes explicit reference to Article 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011. Considering such illegitimacies, Ascopiave S.p.A. has appealed the Ministerial Decree dated 21st May 2014 (and as a consequence the Guidelines) before the administrative court (Regional Administrative Court of Latium). As part of the said proceedings, the issue of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling was raised relating to the interpretation (mainly retrospective) of the new rules on the deduction of private contributions set forth by Law 9/2014.

Lastly, by Resolution 310/2014/R/gas - "Provisions for determining the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks", published on 27th June 2014, the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water approved provisions for determining the reimbursement value of the gas distribution networks, implementing the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 16 of Law Decree dated 23rd December 2013, no. 145, converted with amendments by Law dated 21st February 2014, no. 9.

That provision states that the granting Local Authority shall send the Authority the verification documents containing a detailed calculation of the reimbursement value (RIV), if this value is 10% higher than the local RAB.

The Authority performs the checks set forth in Article 1, paragraph 16 of Law Decree no. 145/13 within 90 days from

the date of receipt of the documentation by the Awarding entities, ensuring priority based on the deadlines for the

publication of the calls for tenders.

With Law no. 116/2014 dated 11th August 2014 (converted with amendments to law decree 24th June 2014 no. 91) the

Legislator has envisaged a further extension of deadlines for the publication of invitations to tender. Specifically, for the

areas belonging to the first group referred to in Annex 1 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011, the time limit was extended by

eight months; for the areas belonging to the second, third and fourth groups the deadline was postponed by six months

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

65

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
and lastly for the areas of the fifth and sixth groups the extension is four months. However, these postponements do not apply to those areas which, although they belong to the first six groups, are affected by earthquakes, because over 15% of the redelivery points are in the municipalities affected by the earthquakes of 20th and 29th May 2012, in compliance with the annex to the Decree of the Minister of economy and finance dated 1st June 2012. The same law, further amending Article 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 2000, has finally determined that the redemption value is to be calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts, provided that the latter were entered into before the date of entry into force of Ministerial Decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226, that is to say before 12th February 2012, thus affirming the principle of retroactive application of the Guidelines, which had already been appealed during the court action against the Guidelines. On 14th July 2015, the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Regional Affairs and Autonomies no. 106 dated 20th May 2015 was published in the Official Gazette, amending the decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226 regarding the tender criteria for awarding the gas distribution service. The most significant changes include:
1) the provisions concerning the value of the reimbursement of the plants to be applied in case of absence of specific agreements between the parties occurred before the entry into force of Decree no. 226/2011, which include to a large extent the provisions of the "Guidelines".
2) a higher maximum threshold for the amount of the annual payments that may be offered in tenders to local authorities. This threshold, previously equal to 5% of the portion of the restriction on tariff revenues to cover the local capital costs, has been brought to 10%;
3) the treatment of a number of important technical and economic aspects related to the tendered energy efficiency investments, concerning the value of the amounts to be paid to local authorities and the payments to cover the costs of the operator which implements the interventions and gains the related energy efficiency certificates.
In 2015, a number of tenders were published for the award of the service with Territorial procedure. Many of them did not follow the procedures required by law, which envisages, among other things, the prior examination by the Authority of the reimbursement amounts of the plants due to outgoing operators as well as the review of the invitation to tender's overall content and annexes before publication. Moreover, most calls are also inconsistent, even significantly, with the instructions contained in the ministerial regulations, also with regard to the criteria for evaluating bids; according to the current regulations, such inconsistencies should be specifically justified by the Awarding Entities. In this context, the standardisation of the tender process envisaged by the law is encountering serious difficulties, to the extent that the procedures may freeze due to a major litigation.
Distribution of dividends
On 23rd April 2015, the Shareholders' Meeting approved the yearly statement and decided the distribution of dividends for an amount equal to Euro 0.15 per share with dividend date on 11th May 2015, record date on 12th May 2015 and payment on 13th May 2015.

In accordance with Art. 40 of Legislative Decree 127 2 d), as of 31st December 2015, the value of own shares held by the company is equal to Euro 17,521 thousand (Euro 17,660 thousand as of 31st December 2014), as can be seen in the Net Equity variations.

Outlook for the Year
As far as the gas distribution activities are concerned, in 2016 the Group will continue its normal operations and service management and perform preparatory activities for the invitations to tender. The Group will also participate in the tenders invited, if any, for the award of the Minimum Territorial Areas in which it is interested. Most Municipalities currently managed by the Ascopiave Group belong to Minimum Territorial Areas for which the maximum deadline to issue the call for tenders exceeds 31st December 2016. However, since tender authorities may anticipate the maximum terms stated in the regulations, it is possible that some Municipalities may be interested in tenders already in 2016. If this should be the case, however, even with no certainties concerning the required time for the assignment, it is reasonable to assume that, for the first call for tenders, possible transfers of management to potential new operators may be executed only after the end of 2016. Thus, the activity perimeter of the Group will likely not change compared to today. As far as profitability is concerned, it will be negatively affected by the adjustment of the capital return rate envisaged in the recent tariff measures; in fact, the actual pre-tax rate of return for the distribution activity was reduced from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.1%, thus determining an expected decrease in global tariff revenues. As far as gas sale is concerned, it is even more difficult to forecast result trends, also due to the impact of weather conditions, which significantly affect gas consumption. However, for the time being there is no reason to believe that in the near future there will be considerable variations in business profitability conditions, despite the competitive pressure in the retail market and the expected impact of the tariff measures defined by AEEGSI for the protected market. As regards electricity sales, the fiscal year 2016 could confirm 2015 results. However, these results could be influenced, in addition to the possible tariff provisions by the Electricity, Gas and Water System Authority (AEEGSI) ­ currently unforeseeable ­ also by the evolution of the more general competitive context, as well as by the Group's procurement strategy. The actual results of 2016 could differ compared to those announced depending on various factors amongst which: the evolution of supply and demand and gas prices, the actual operational performance, the general macroeconomic conditions, the impact of regulations in the energy and environmental fields, success in the development and application of new technologies, the changes in stakeholder expectations and other changes to business conditions.

Goals and policies of the group and risk description Credit and liquidity risk

The main financial instruments in use by our Group are represented by trade payables and receivables, liquidity, bank debt and other forms of financing. It is maintained that the Group is not exposed to credit risks greater than the product sector average, considering the numerous customers and the low physical risk in the service of gas delivery. To keep residual credit risks under control, there is in any case a fund for the devaluation of credit equal to approximately 14.6% (21.7% as of 31st December 2014) of the total gross credit of third parties. Significant commercial operations take place

in Italy. With reference to the company financial management, the administrators consider it appropriate to generate a cash flow suitable for covering its needs.
The main payment obligations opened as of 31st December 2015 are associated with contracts for natural gas supply.

Risks relating to bids for the award of new concessions for the distribution of gas
As of 31st December 2015, the Ascopiave Group holds a portfolio of 208 (208 as of 31st December 2014) natural gas distribution concessions located throughout the country. In compliance with the regulations in force governing the concessions held by the company, the calls for tenders for the new awards of the gas distribution service will be no longer announced for every single Municipality but exclusively for the territorial areas determined with Ministerial Decrees dated 19th January 2011 and 18th October 2011, and pursuant to the deadlines illustrated in Annex 1 attached to the Ministerial Decree on tender criteria and bid assessment standards, issued on 12th November 2011. With new tenders being launched, Ascopiave S.p.A. may not be able to obtain one or more new concessions, or it could obtain them at less advantageous conditions than the current ones, with possible negative impacts on the operative activity and the economic, equity and financial situation, it being understood that, if the company is not awarded with a new concession, limited to the Municipalities previously managed by the company, it will obtain a reimbursement value envisaged for the outgoing operator.

Risks relating to the amount of reimbursement paid by the new operator

With regard to the concessions under which the Ascopiave Group also owns the gas distribution networks, Law no. 9 / 2014 establishes that the new operator shall pay a reimbursement calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts and, even if not inferable by the will of the Parties and for aspects which are not envisaged in those agreements or contracts, based on guidelines on operating criteria and methods for the assessment of the reimbursement value as per article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98. In any case, private contributions related to local assets (assessed in accordance with the methodology of tariff regulation in force) have to be deducted from the reimbursement value. In addition, if the reimbursement value is higher than 10% of the value of local assets calculated as per tariff regulation, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, the granting local body submits the related evaluations detailing the reimbursement value to the Authority for Electricity and Gas and Water Supply System so that it can be checked before publishing the invitation to tender. The Minister for Economic Development Decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226 establishes that the new operator acquires the property of the plant by paying the redemption value to the outgoing operator, except for any portion of it owned by the municipality. In the periods following the first, transitional one, the reimbursement value to the outgoing operator shall be equal to the local net intangible assets, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, calculated with reference to the criteria used by the Authority to determine the distribution tariffs (RAB). As far as this point is concerned, it should be noted that the Authority has recently intervened with Resolution 367/2014/R/gas, providing that the redemption value, referred to in Article 14, paragraph 8, of Legislative Decree no. 164/00, at the end of the first

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

68

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
period of concession is determined as the sum of: a) the residual value of the existing stock at the beginning of the concession period, assessed for all the fixed assets subject to transfer for consideration to the new operator in the second period of concession based on the redemption value, provided for in Article 5 of Decree 226/11, recognized to the outgoing operator in the first territorial concession, taking into account the depreciations and divestments recognized for tariff purposes in the concession period; b) the residual value of the new investments made in the concession period and existing at the end of the period, assessed based on the re-valued historical cost method for the period in which the investments are recognized in the final balance, as provided in Article 56 of the Tariff Regulation of Gas Distribution and Measurement Services, and as the average between the net value determined based on the re-valued historical cost method and the net value determined based on standard cost assessment methods, pursuant to paragraph 3.1 of Resolution 573/2013/R/GAS, for the next period. The Group intends to protect its financial performance and standing with respect to regulatory changes as described in the terms set out in the section "Territorial areas" of this report.

Research and development

IT Systems In support of the sales companies of the Group, during 2015 the innovation strategy of information systems in order to create new services for the end customer continued. In particular, the CRM system implemented for Ascotrade S.pA. has been extended to all the sales companies, a new system to manage offers intended for customers has been introduced and the websites of all the Group's companies have been completely revamped. In addition, the "A Tutta Energia" club has been developed: it offers discounts, benefits and coupons reserved to our customers that can be used in a network of selected partners. The Ascopiave Group has then completed the adoption of the CBILL circuit created by Consorzio CBI, allowing its customers (individuals and companies) to use a new payment channel and pay the bills issued by the Group's companies directly through their Internet Banking. As far as regulatory changes are concerned, the main project has involved the adaptation of invoicing to the "Bolletta 2.0" standard that has revolutionised the layout of Gas and Electricity bills. In 2015, an IT tool to support electricity dispatching activities was basically completed; it automates the dialogue with the management systems of the group's sales companies.

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the first half of 2015 a project to extend the use of electronic billing to our suppliers based on the system created for the Public Administration was then implemented. The project has led to the construction of a platform able to receive invoices according to the xml layout of Public Administration electronic invoices. Electronic invoices in "PA format" are automatically loaded into our systems.
The functionalities to support the reporting management system based on SAP BPC, were expanded by heavily modifying the module supporting budget activities and by implementing a new module in support of gas distribution.
During the year, the features of the application dedicated to the management of watch-list receivables were enhanced, by virtue of a better integration of the law firms network and the enrichment of the debt collection practices, thus enabling a significantly faster issuance of injunctions.
Another significant project implemented in 2015 concerns the use of Big Data analysis and Predictive Analytics techniques applied in the credit area. The project has entailed the construction of a Big Data platform in the credit area and the creation of a model able to estimate the evolution of the credit risk on a geographical basis based on the historical data (outstanding payments per customer) and the trend of external variables, including macroeconomic variables, with the possibility of building scenarios and supporting forecasts and what-if analyses.
As for the digitisation of accounts receivables, a project has been completed in order to send invoices by certified email to all subjects with a VAT identification number; this project has entailed the full traceability of the process for over 50% of the portfolio, faster delivery times and the elimination of the related costs.
In addition, other significant projects have involved the development of new features for the software supporting the management of legal disputes, the enhancement of the features of the tool supporting the management of certified email boxes, and an improvement in the electrical safety of the Disaster Recovery data-centre. In 2015, the Work Force Management system to support the Technical Department of the Gas Distribution company, which was put into production in late 2014, was perfected. The WFM system has substantially changed the processes through which field interventions are planned and implemented, entailing many advantages through the introduction of automatic systems to schedule operations and optimize the use of resources, the application of principles of saturation of the working day and minimization of paths. The resources operating in the area have been equipped with mobile devices for the assignment of meter tasks, the field consultation of information necessary to carry out the interventions and the immediate final balance of the work performed. Task status can therefore be monitored in real time, allowing better planning and communication of the outcomes of the operations and thus substantially improving the level of service offered to customers. In 2015, the Central Acquisition System (SAC) of readings already in use for meters above G6 was also extended to G4 meters. Moreover, in addition to the installations of point-to-point electronic meters, the first installations of point-tomultipoint smart meters with 169 MHz technology began as well. Both types of meters can be managed with the Central Acquisition System installed.
The activities to enable interaction with the Integrated Information System (SII) have continued, including the implementation of a Communication Port according to the specifications issued by Acquirente Unico.
In 2015, a new system for budgeting and order management was released to production; it also supports the information flows exchanged with external companies which provide construction services.
Also in support of the Gas Distribution companies of the Group, new functionalities have been introduced to the management systems and the Portal of the Distributor to comply with regulatory updates, the need of improving

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
According to Consob communication DEM 6064293 dated 28th July 2006 and by recommendation CESR/05-178b on alternative performance indicators, we specify that besides normal performance indicators fixed by International Accounting Principles IAS/IFRS, the Group considers useful for its business monitoring activity, the use of other performance indicators, which, even if they do not appear yet in the afore-stated principles, have a considerable importance. In particular we introduced the following indicators:
- Gross operative spread (Ebitda): defined by the Group as the result of amortisations, credit depreciation, financial managing and taxes;
- Operating result: this indicator is accounted for by the accounting principles we refer to, and it is defined as operative spread (Ebit) minus the balance of costs and non-recurrent revenues. This last item includes extraordinary incomes and losses, appreciations and capital losses for alienation of assets, insurance reimbursements, taxes and others positive and negative components with less relevance.
- Revenues from the tariff on the activity of gas distribution: defined by the Group as the amount of revenue realised by the distribution companies of the Group for the implementation of tariffs for distribution and measurement of natural gas to their end customers, net of amounts equalisation managed by the Cassa Conguaglio per il Settore Elettrico (Electricity Equalisation Fund);
- First margin on gas sales: the Group defines it as the amount obtained from the difference between the sales proceeds (realised by the Group's sale companies to end customers or final market within the business of trading and selling as a wholesaler) and the sum of the following costs: the cost of transmission service (gross of amounts subject to elimination and distribution tariffs applied by the distribution companies) and the purchase cost of gas sold;
- First margin on electric power sale: the Group defines it as the amount obtained from the difference between the proceeds of sale of electricity and the sum of the following costs: cost of transport services, dispatching and balancing cost and purchase of electricity sold.

Revenues from gas sale decreased from Euro 473,641 thousand to Euro 472,974 thousand, thus recording a decrease of Euro 667 thousand (-0.1%). The positive effect of higher volumes of gas sold is offset by the decrease in average unit sale prices.

Revenues from electricity sales decreased from Euro 67,199 thousand to Euro 61,188 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 6,011 thousand (-8.9%), mainly due to lower volumes of electricity sold.

The operating result for 2015 amounts to Euro 56,950 thousand, thus recording an increase of Euro 4,283 thousand (+8.1%) compared to the previous year. The improvement is due to several factors:
- decrease in the tariff revenues on the activity of gas distribution for Euro 708 thousand; - increase in the first margin on the activity of gas sales, equal to Euro 1,201 thousand; - decrease in the first margin on the activity of electricity sale, equal to Euro 1,509 thousand; - increase in other items of cost and revenues, equal to Euro 5,300 thousand.

The decrease in the revenues from tariffs in the gas distribution activity (decreasing from Euro 62,669 thousand to Euro 61,960 thousand) is due to the entry into force of the new tariff regulation for the period 2014-2019 (so-called fourth regulatory period) envisaged by AEEGSI resolution 367/2014/R/gas.

The increase in the first margin on the activity of gas sale (from Euro 63,190 thousand to Euro 64,391 thousand), is mainly due to higher volumes of gas sold, offset by the decrease in average unit sale prices.

The decrease in the first margin on the activity of electricity sales, from Euro 5,342 thousand to Euro 3,833 thousand is due to lower unit margins and lower amounts of electricity sold compared to the previous year, which had benefited from a downward-moving trend of purchase prices.

The positive variation in the item other costs and revenues, amounting to Euro 5,300 thousand, is mainly due to:

- lower other revenues for Euro 2,022 thousand;

- lower material and service costs and other charges equalling Euro 3,283 thousand;

- lower personnel cost for Euro 1,153 thousand;

____________________________________________________________________________________________

77

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
- lower amortization of fixed assets for Euro 70 thousand; - lower bad debts provisions for Euro 2,815 thousand.
The net consolidated profit of 2015 amounts to Euro 45,362 thousand, thus recording an increase of Euro 8,029 thousand (+21.5%) compared to the previous year. The variation is due to the following factors:
- an increase in the operating result, as previously stated, for Euro 4,283 thousand; - higher result of companies consolidated through the equity method for Euro 2,996 thousand; - decrease in financial revenues for Euro 561 thousand; - decrease in financial charges for Euro 1,636 thousand; - increase in taxes for Euro 325 thousand, due to the increase in income. The tax rate, calculated by normalizing the pre-tax result of the effects of consolidation of the companies consolidated using the equity method, decreases from 35.6% to 32.8%.

The cash flow generated by the operating management (letters a + b), equal to Euro 68,89 thousand, was mainly due to self-financing for Euro 69,395 thousand and other financial positive variations amounting to Euro 501 thousand, mainly related to the management of the net circulating capital for Euro 6,262 thousand and to the assessment of companies consolidated through the equity method for Euro -7,449 thousand. Management of net circulating capital has generated financial resources amounting to Euro 6,262 thousand and was influenced mainly by a variation in the overall balance with the Technical Office for Taxation on Building and Regional Taxation, which has generated financial resources for Euro 31,577 thousand, by the variation in VAT allocation, which has generated financial resources for Euro 2,659 thousand, by the variation in the position towards the Inland Revenue for the accrual of IRES and IRAP taxes, which has generated financial resources for Euro 7,794 thousand, nd the variation in the net operating capital, which has absorbed financial resources for Euro 36,523 thousand.

In accordance with CONSOB resolution no. 15519 dated 27th July 2006, the effects of the transactions with related parties are highlighted in the table in paragraph "Transactions with related parties" of this financial report.
N.b.: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares net of own shares. For the purposes of the calculation of the basic earnings per share, we specify that the numerator is the economic result for the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.

EXPLANATORY NOTES

As of 31st December 2015, 61.56% of the Company's share capital, amounting to  234,411,575 was held by Asco Holding S.p.A.; the remainder was distributed among other private shareholders. Ascopiave is listed since December 2006 on the Mercato Telematico Azionario ­ STAR Segment ­ organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.. The registered office of the Company is in Pieve di Soligo (TV), via Verizzo, 1030, Italy. The publication of the Financial report as of 31st December 2015 of the Ascopiave Group was authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors on 14th March 2016.

The activities of the Ascopiave Group
Ascopiave mainly operates in the sectors of distribution and sale of natural gas, as well as in other sectors related to the core business, such as the sale of electrical energy, heat management and co-generation. The Group owns concessions and direct entrusting for the management of the activity of gas distribution in 208 municipalities (208 municipalities in 2043), supplying the service to more than one million users. The group is the owner of the distribution network managed that is extended for more than 8,800 kilometres. The activity of natural gas sale to end customers is carried out through different companies, some of which are controlled with majority shares, others are shared with other partners and on them the Group exercise a joint control with other shareholders. In the Gas sale sector Ascopiave is one of the main National operators, featuring approximately 979 million cubic meters of gas sold6.

General drafting criteria and declaration of conformity with IFRS

The Ascopiave Group Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31st December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS, that is all the "International Financial Reporting Standards", "International Accounting Standards" (IAS), all the interpretations of the "International Financial Reporting Committee" (IFRIC), previously "Standing Interpretations Committee" (SIC) adopted by the European Commission in accordance with the procedure set forth in Art. 6 of EC Directive no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council on 19th July 2002 as well as with the provisions issued for the implementation of Art. 9 of Legislative Decree no. 38/2005.
The consolidated financial statements are based on the principle of historical cost, taking into account the adjustments as appropriate, with the exception of the budget items that under IFRS must be recognized at fair value as described in the evaluation criteria and according to the principle of going-concern. The accounting principles adopted are consistent with those used as of 31st December 2014, except as described in the following paragraph Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations effective from 1st January 2015. For

The data specified as regards the volumes of gas sold are obtained by adding each Group company's data, previously pondering the data of the companies consolidated with the equity method according to the relevant share.

comparative purposes, the consolidated profiles present the comparison with balance sheet figures as of 31st December 2014.
The consolidated financial statements are subject to auditing procedure by the auditing company PricewatherhouseCoopers SpA, in charge of the external audit of the Parent Company and the main Companies of the Group.
The consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euro, the currency used in the economy where the Group operates, and includes the Consolidated assets and liabilities statement, the Overall consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, the Consolidated financial statement and the Explanatory notes. All the values reported in the statements and explanatory notes are expressed in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise indicated.
The values used for consolidation were gathered from income statements and balance sheets prepared by the Directors of the individual subsidiaries. These data have been adjusted and reclassified, where necessary, to ensure compliance with international accounting standards and with the classification criteria applied throughout the Group. These consolidated financial statements as of 31st December 2015 were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on 14th March 2016.

Financial statements representation
The items of the consolidated assets and liabilities statement are classified into "current" and "non-current"; those in the overall consolidated income statement are classified by their nature in multi-step format. The statement of changes in shareholders' equity presents the opening and closing balances of each net equity item reconciling them through the profit or loss for the period, any operation with shareholders (if applicable) and other variations in the net equity. The financial statement has been defined according to the "indirect" method, by adjusting operating income of nonmonetary components. We believe that these patterns adequately represent the economic situation and financial position.
Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations applied from 1st January 2015
Please find below a brief description of the amendments, improvements and interpretations applicable to financial statements closed as of 31st December 2015 and entered into force on 1st January 2015. The application of these standards had no particular impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, as they relate to matters that are not present, or they only affect financial reporting: IFRIC 21 - Levies IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability is recognised before the specified minimum threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is retrospectively applied. This interpretation is applied to the financial statements beginning on 17th June 2014 or later;

Improvements to IFRSs 2011­2013 Cycle In December 2013 the IASB issued the document "Annual improvements to IFRSs ­ 2011-2013 Cycle" applicable to the fiscal periods beginning on, or after, 1st January 2015 as part of the principles' annual improvement programme. Most are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRSs or amendments subsequent to changes previously made to IFRSs.

Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not adopted ahead of time by the Group

Please find below the amendments, improvements and interpretations which, at the date of the consolidated financial statements, had already been issued but were not yet effective. Amendments to IAS 19: Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions In November 2013, the IASB issued the document "Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions. The changes made to IAS 19 allow the entry, to reduce the current service cost of the period, of the contributions paid by employees or by third parties, that are not related to the number of years of service, instead of allocating such contributions over the period when the service is rendered. The amendments are effective retrospectively for fiscal periods beginning on or after 1st February 2015.
Improvements to IFRSs 2010­2012 Cycle In December 2013 the IASB issued the documents "Annual improvements to IFRSs ­ 2010-2012 Cycle" applicable to the fiscal periods beginning on, or after, 1st February 2015 as part of the principles' annual improvement programme. Most are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRSs or amendments subsequent to changes previously made to IFRS. The amendments are applicable for fiscal periods beginning on or after 1st February 2015.
Amendments to IAS 27: Separate financial statements In August 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 27 - Separate Financial Statements. The goal is to allow the assessment of investments in associates and joint ventures according to the equity method even in the separate financial statements. These amendments are effective for the periods beginning on 1st January 2016.
Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements In December 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1. The goal is to clarify some doubts about the presentation and disclosure requirements and to ensure that companies can use professional judgement in determining what information to disclose in their financial statements focusing on relevant information. These amendments are effective for periods beginning on 1st January 2016.
Improvements to IFRSs 2012­2014 Cycle In September 2014, the IASB issued the documents "Annual improvements to IFRSs ­ 2012­2014 Cycle" (applicable to the fiscal periods ended after 1st January 2016) as part of the principles' annual improvement programme. Most are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRSs or amendments subsequent to changes previously made to IFRS. Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortization In May 2014, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 - Intangible assets. The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

89

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IASB has also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, however, can be rebutted in certain limited circumstances. These changes are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2016.
Amendments to IFRS 11: Joint arrangements: Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
In May 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 11 ­ Joint arrangements: Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, which require that an entity adopts the principles contained in IFRS 3 to recognise the accounting effects of acquisitions of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. The amendments are effective retroactively for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2016.

Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not adopted ahead of time by the Group

Please find below a brief description of the new standards, amendments, improvements and interpretations already issued but not yet approved by the European Union and therefore not applicable for the preparation of financial statements closed as of 31st December 2015. The list does not include the standards and interpretations which by their nature are not adoptable by the Group.

IFRS 15 - Revenues from contracts with customers

In May 2014, the IASB issued the standard IFRS 15 - Revenues from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To this end, the new recognition model defines a five-step process. The new standard also requires further additional information about the nature, the amount, timing and uncertainty about revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018. The Group is assessing the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments. The series of changes introduced by the new standard replace the provisions of IAS 39 and introduce a logical approach for the classification and measurement of financial instruments driven by cash flow characteristics and the business model in which an asset is held, a single impairment model to be applied to all financial assets based on expected losses and a substantially reformed approach for hedge accounting. The new standard will be applied retroactively from 1st January 2018.

Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exceptions

In December 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28. The aim is to clarify: i) the method of accounting for investment entities; ii) the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements for an intermediate parent entity and iii) how a company that is not an investment entity should apply the equity method evaluation of an investment entity. These amendments are effective for periods commencing 1st January 2016.

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

In September 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures. The aim is to clarify the accounting method of the results related to the sale

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

90

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
of assets between companies in a group and associated companies and joint ventures. The approval process of these amendments has been suspended and the application date has been postponed to a future date to be determined.

Consolidation principles

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all the subsidiaries. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to the variability of results from such entities and has the possibility of influencing these outcomes through the exercise of power over the entity. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated financial statements commencing the date on which control is taken until the date such control ceases. The costs incurred in the acquisition process are expensed in the year they are incurred. The assets and liabilities, the charges and income of companies consolidated with the line-by-line method are fully included in the consolidated financial statements; the book value of investments is eliminated against the corresponding share of equity of the investee companies. Receivables and payables, as well as the costs and revenues arising from transactions between companies included in the consolidation area are entirely eliminated; the capital gains and losses arising from transfers of assets between consolidated companies, the gains and losses deriving from transactions between consolidated companies related to the sale of assets that remain as inventories of the purchasing company, the writedowns and write-backs of investments in consolidated companies, as well as intercompany dividends are also eliminated. At the date of acquisition of control, the net equity of the investee companies is determined by attributing to the individual assets and liabilities their current value. Any positive difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as "Goodwill"; if negative, it is recognized in the income statement. The equity and profit shares attributable to minority interests are recorded in specific items of the shareholders' equity and income statement. In the case of acquisition of partial control, the equity share of minority interests is determined on the basis of the share of the current values assigned to assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition of control, excluding any goodwill attributable to them (so-called partial goodwill method); in relation to this, the minority interests are measured at their total fair value, also including the goodwill (negative goodwill) attributable to them. The choice of the methods for determining the goodwill (negative goodwill) is made based on each individual business combination operation. In the case of shares acquired subsequent to the acquisition of control (purchase of minority interests), any difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding portion of equity acquired is recognized in the equity; similarly, the effects arising from the sale of minority interests without loss of control are recognized in equity. If the acquisition value of the shares is higher than the net equity pro-quota value of the investees, the positive difference is attributed, where possible, to the net assets acquired based on their fair value while the remainder is recorded in an item of assets, "Goodwill". The value of goodwill is not amortized but is subject to, at least on an annual basis, an impairment test when facts or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be realized. Goodwill is booked at cost, net of impairment losses. If the carrying value of the investments is lower than the net equity pro-quota value of the investees, the negative difference is recognized in the income statement. The acquisition costs are booked in the income statement. Associated companies are those over which a significant influence is exercised, which is presumed to exist when the shareholding is between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

91

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
subsequently accounted for using the equity method. The carrying value of these investments is in line with the Shareholders' equity and includes the recording of the higher values attributed to assets and liabilities and any goodwill identified upon acquisition. The unrealized gains and losses generated on transactions between the Parent Company/Subsidiaries and the investee valued with the equity method are eliminated based on the value of the stake held by the Group in the investee; the unrealized losses are eliminated, except when they represent an impairment. The financial statements of the Subsidiaries used for the purpose of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements are those approved by the respective Boards of Directors. The data of the Consolidated companies are adjusted, where necessary, to harmonize them with the accounting standards used by the Parent company, which are in accordance with the IFRSs adopted by the European Union.
Business combinations The business combinations through which the control of an entity is acquired are recognised, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, by using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is the fair value at the date of purchase of the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and the equity instruments issued. The identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities and the potential liabilities assumed are recognised at acquisition-date fair value, except deferred tax assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities for employees' benefits and assets held for sale booked based on the relevant accounting standards. The difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, if positive, is recorded under intangible assets as goodwill and, if negative, after verifying the correct measurement of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and the cost acquisition, is recognised directly in the profit and loss account as gain. The acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement when they are incurred. The cost of acquisition also includes the contingent consideration, recognised at fair value at the date of control acquisition. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss or the overall profit and loss account if the contingent consideration is a financial asset or liability. Contingent considerations classified as Equity are not recalculated and the subsequent settlement is accounted for directly in Equity. If the business combinations through which control is acquired occur in multiple stages, the Group recalculates the equity interest it previously held in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date and recognises in the profit and loss account any resulting profit or loss. Acquisitions of minority interests in entities for which control is already held or sale of minority interests which do not involve the loss of control are considered as Equity transactions; therefore, any difference between the cost of acquisition/divestiture and its acquired/divested portion of Shareholders' equity is recognised to adjust the Group's Shareholders' equity. In the event of purchase of non-controlling interests, goodwill is only recognised for the portion attributable to the parent company. The minority interest amount is determined in proportion to the minority interests in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. Incidental expenses related to the acquisition are recognised in profit or loss when the services are rendered.

# < C the goodwill obtained from the acquisition of business branches operating in the supply and sale of gas is initially booked at cost and represents the excess of the purchase price compared to the portion pertaining to the purchaser for the net fair value referred to values identifying the current and potential assets and liabilities.

After the initial booking, goodwill can no longer be amortized and is reduced by any losses of value.

Goodwill is subjected to an annual recoverability analysis, or a more frequent one if events or changes in circumstances occur which can lead to the emergence of possible losses of value.

With the intent of analysing the recoverability, the goodwill acquired through groups of company is allocated, as of the acquisition date, to each of the units (or groups of units) that generate financial flows with the Group that it is held would benefit from the synergy effects of the acquisition, without regard to the allocation of other assets or liabilities of these units (or groups of units).

Units generating financial flows:

(i)

represent the lowest level, within the Group, to which the goodwill is monitored for internal management

purposes;

(ii) are no greater than one sector, as defined in the primary or secondary indication scheme of the Group in accordance with IFRS 8 "Product information sector".

Loss of value is determined by defining the recoverable value of a unit which generates flows (or groups of units) to which the goodwill is allocated. When the recoverable value of a unit which generates flows (or group of units) is inferior to the book value, a loss of value is indicated. In cases in which the goodwill is attributed to a unit which generates financial flows (or group of units) which is activated through partial abandonment the goodwill associated with the transferred profit is considered in order to determine the positive or negative change derived from the operation. Goodwill transferred in such cases is calculated on the basis of the values relative to the asset transferred with respect to the asset still held with reference to the same unit.

Other intangible assets: intangible assets mainly include assets pertaining to concessions between the public and the private sectors (so-called service concession agreements) related to development, financing, management and maintenance of infrastructures in concession, of which:
(i) the lessor controls or regulates the services supplied by operator through the infrastructure and their prices; (ii) the lessor controls through property, ownership of benefits or in other ways any significant remaining profit-
sharing at the end of the concession.

Other intangible assets also include the recognition of the fair value of customer lists resulting from the acquisition of companies operating in the sale of natural gas and electricity that occurred in previous years and in the current year (Veritas Energia S.p.A.) rather than, the recognition of charges paid to the awarding entities (Municipalities) and/or the outgoing operators subsequent to the assignment and/or the renewal of the relevant invitation to tender to award the service of natural gas distribution. As concerns the write-off period:
(i) the customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis, based on the estimate of the benefits that will have effects in future years and determined during the Purchase Price Allocation. In particular, the Directors have established that the useful life associated with customer lists is ten years, due to the low turnover rate of customers, represented mainly by civil users;
(ii) the concessions for the service of natural gas distribution are amortized on a straight-line basis, based on the duration of the concession period. In particular, the amortization period of the concessions acquired by the Ascopiave Group is equal to twelve years in accordance with the regulatory framework.
After the initial reporting, as they have a defined useful life, intangible assets are booked net of the accumulated relevant amortization operations and net of any losses in value, determined with the same basis indicated below for tangible assets. The useful life is then re-examined on an annual basis, and any changes, if necessary, made prospectively. Assets acquired under financial leases are booked at fair value, net of taxes due by the lessee or, if lower, at the current value of the minimum lease payments, including any sum payable for the exercise of the option to purchase, in intangible assets offsetting the financial debt to the lessor. Any profits or losses deriving from the sale of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the disposal value and the book value of the asset, and are reported on the income statement at the time of the sale.
Duration and residual value of assets under concession: The gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree n. 164/00 (so-called Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, after 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value.

Tangible fixed assets: tangible assets are booked at their historic cost, including accessory costs directly ascribable to the putting into operation of the asset for the use for which it was acquired. Lands - both free of constructions and annexed to civil and industrial buildings - were generally accounted for separately and are not depreciated since they are elements with an unlimited useful life. Maintenance and repair costs that are not subject to valuing and/or extending the residual useful life of assets, are spent in the year in which they are borne. Otherwise, they are capitalised.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tangible assets are presented net of the relevant accumulated depreciation, and any losses of value determined according to the basis described below. Amortisation is calculated in uniform instalments on the basis of the estimated useful life of the asset for the company, which is re-examined annually, and any changes, if necessary, are made prospectively. The main economical-technical rates used are as follows:

Buildings Equipment Furniture Electronic equipment Basic hardware and software Motorcars, motor vehicles and similar

2% 8.5% - 8.3%
8.80% 16.20%
20% 20%

The book value of tangible fixed assets is subject to verification in order to report any loss of value, should events or changes of situation suggest that the book value may not be recovered. Should there be an indication of this type and, in the event that the book value should exceed the presumed realisation value, the assets are devalued so as to reflect their realisation value. The realisation value of the tangible fixed assets is represented by the greater of the net sales price and the value of use.
Losses of value are reported on the income statement with the costs for amortizations and write downs. Such losses of value are restored should the reasons for their cause cease to exist.
When the asset is sold or if there are no future economic benefits expected from the use of the asset, it is eliminated from the financial statements and any loss or profit (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the book value) is entered in the income statement of the year of the above mentioned elimination.

Shareholdings: The shareholdings recognised in this item relate to long-term investments; the Group classifies its shareholdings into the following categories:
· shareholdings accounted for using the equity method;
· other shareholdings

Shareholdings accounted for using the equity method: these shareholdings are in turn divided into two categories: · Shareholdings in joint companies: The shareholdings in joint companies, i.e. in which the Group controls the entity with other shareholders, are accounted for using the net equity method. The profit and loss account shows the share of the Group in the operating profit of the joint company. According to the equity method, shareholdings are recognised in the balance sheet at cost, adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the net assets, net of any loss in value of individual shareholdings. The excess of acquisition cost as compared to the share attributable to the Group of the identifiable fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company at the acquisition date is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment and is subject to impairment tests.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
· Shareholdings in affiliate companies: The shareholdings in affiliate companies, i.e. in which the Group has a significant influence, are accounted for using the net equity method. The profit and loss account shows the share of the Group in the operating profit of the affiliate. If an affiliate company detects adjustments directly attributable to the net equity, the Group recognizes its share and includes it, where applicable, in the statement of changes in the net equity.
In the event that the loss attributable to the Group exceeds the book value of the shareholding, the latter is cancelled and any excess is recognized in a special fund to the extent that the Group has legal or constructive obligations towards the subsidiary to cover its losses or, however, to make payments on its behalf. If, at a later stage, the loss does no longer exist or has decreased, a reversal of an impairment loss is booked in the income statement, up to its cost.

Shareholdings in other companies: the shareholdings in companies other than subsidiaries, affiliate and joint ventures (generally with a stake lower than 20%), if their fair value at the date of the balance sheet cannot be determined because the related shares are not listed, are valued at their cost of purchase or subscription, minus any repayment of principal, and are subsequently adjusted for losses in value determined in the same manner previously described for the tangible assets.

Other non-current assets: are booked at their nominal value adjusted for any losses in value, corresponding to the amortised cost.

Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:
· assets at fair value through Profit or Loss;
· loans and receivables;
· financial assets held to maturity;
· financial assets available for sale.
Financial assets at fair value through Profit or Loss: this category includes financial assets acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term, as well as derivatives (for the latter, please refer to the specific paragraph below). The fair value of these instruments is determined with reference to the market value at the closing date of the reporting period. The changes in fair value of the instruments falling within this category are immediately recognised in the profit and loss account. The distinction between current and non-current reflects the directors' expectations regarding their trading.

Loans and receivables: This category includes loans not represented by derivative instruments and not listed on an active market, from which fixed or determinable payments are expected. These assets are initially recognised at fair value and, subsequently, measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. If there is objective evidence indicating impairment, the assets' value is reduced to such an extent as to be equal to the discounted value of future cash flows: the impairments determined upon the impairment test are recognised in the profit and loss account. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the previous write-downs cease to exist, the value of the assets is restored up to

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

97

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
the value that would have resulted from the application of the amortised cost if the impairment test had not been performed. These assets are classified as current assets, except for those due beyond 12 months, which are included in non-current assets.
Financial assets held to maturity: this category includes financial instruments, other than derivatives, with fixed maturities and that the Group has the intention and ability to hold in its portfolio until maturity. They are classified as current assets if their contractual maturity is envisaged within the next 12 months. If there is objective evidence indicating impairment, the asset's value is reduced to such an extent as to be equal to the discounted value of future cash flows: the impairments determined upon the impairment test are recognised in the profit and loss account. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the previous write-downs cease to exist, the value of the assets is restored up to the value that would have resulted from the application of the amortised cost if the impairment test had not been performed.
Financial assets available for sale: This category includes financial assets, other than derivative instruments, specifically designated as falling within this category or not classified in any of the previous items. These assets are measured at fair value, which is calculated with reference to market prices at the date of annual or interim financial statements, or through financial evaluation techniques and models, recognising their changes in value in a specific equity reserve. The classification as current or non-current depends on the intentions of the Management and the actual marketability of the security itself. They are classified as current assets if they are expected to be realised within 12 months.
Inventories: inventories are booked at whichever of the following is lower: purchase and/or manufacturing cost, determined in accordance with the weighted average cost basis, or the estimated realizable net value. The net realisation value is determined on the basis of the estimated sales price in normal market conditions, net of direct sales costs. Obsolete and/or slow to realise inventories are written down in relation to their presumed possibility of use or future realisation. The write down is eliminated in the following years, should the reasons for its cause cease to exist.

Inventories of stored natural gas The inventories of stored natural gas, are booked at whichever of the following is lower: purchase cost including incidental expenses, determined by applying the weighted average cost, or the spot market value at the closing date of the period.
Trade receivables and other current assets: trade receivables and other current assets, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, are not discounted back and are booked at amortized cost net of the relevant value losses. These are suited to their presumed realisation value through the reporting in a specific adjustment fund, which is constituted when there is objective evidence that the Company will be unable to receive credit for the original value. Provisions to the reserve for doubtful accounts are reported on the income statement. The Group sells some of its trade receivables through sale operations of receivables ("factoring"). Factoring transactions are with recourse.

Cash and cash equivalents: they include cash values, values available at sight, other short term financial investments. They are accounted at nominal value.

Own shares: Re-acquired own shares are taken as a decrease in the assets. The original cost of own shares, revenues from sales and any other subsequent variation are recognized under the net equity.

Benefits for employees: benefits guaranteed to employees, paid when or after employment ceases, by means of programs with defined benefits (Employees' leaving indemnities) or with other long-term benefits (retirement indemnity) are recognized in the period when the right accrues. The liability related to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognised on an accrual basis consistent with the employment period required to obtain the benefits. Defined benefit plans also include severance indemnity (TFR) owed to the employees of the Group companies in accordance with Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, accrued prior to the reform of this regulation occurred in 2007 (Finance Act of 27th December 2006 no. 296), subsequent to which, for companies employing more than 50 persons and for quotas accrued commencing 1st January 2007, the Severance indemnity is classified as a defined contribution plan.

The Group's obligations are separately determined for each plan, by estimating the present value of future benefits that employees have accrued during the current year and in previous financial periods. This calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. The components of the defined benefits are recognized as follows: - the re-measurement components of liabilities, which include actuarial gains and losses, are recognized immediately
in Other comprehensive income (loss); - costs related to the provision of services are recognized in the profit and loss statement; - net financial charges in the defined benefit liability are recognized in the income statement; The re-measurement components recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) are never reclassified in the profit and loss statement of the following years. For the Severance indemnity accrued after 1st January 2007, the company is only required to pay contributions to the State (so-called Fondo INPS) or to a trust fund or a legally separate entity (so-called Fund) and is determined on the basis of contributions due. Moreover, the Group has signed compensation plans partly based on Ascopiave S.p.A.'s shares and settled through the delivery of shares (stock option plans, long-term incentive plans), recognized as liabilities and measured at fair value at the end of each accounting period and up to the time of payment. Any subsequent change in fair value is recognized in the profit and loss statement. The remaining part of the plan instead is paid in the form of options that can only be sold for cash. The cost of cash operations is evaluated initially at the fair value as of the date of allocation. In particular, the plans adopted by the Group include the allocation of rights including acknowledgement in favour of the beneficiaries of an extraordinary payment linked to the reaching of pre-set objectives, the financial regulation of which is based on the trend of the share title. This fair value is spent in the period until maturation with reporting of a corresponding payable. The liability is recalculated upon each closure of the period, until the date of regulation, with all changes made to the fair value reported on the income statement. In 2015, the compensation plans relating to the preceding three-year period were settled; this operation has entailed the allotment of 99,078 shares. In accordance with the rules governing the plan, there were no other allotments in the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
period, since the benefits will accrue at the end of the financial year. These compensation plans are accounted for in compliance with the requirements set out in IFRS 2. For more details on the compensations paid during the year 2015, please refer to "Section II" of the Remuneration Report, prepared pursuant to art. 123 - ter of Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 (TUF).

Reserves for risks and charges: The reserves for risks and charges concern costs and charges of a given type, and of certain or probable existence, which on the closing date of the financial year are undetermined in terms of amount or due date. Provisions are reported when: (i) there is a current obligation (legal or implicit) that derives from a past event; (ii) an outlay of resources is likely in order to meet the obligation; (iii) a reasonable estimate can be made as to the amount of the obligation.
On the other hand, where it is not possible to carry out a probable estimate as to the obligation, or alternatively, it is deemed that the outlay of financial resources is only possible and not probably, the relevant potential liability is not marked in the financial statements, but rather mentioned appropriately in the explanatory notes. Provisions are reported at the representative value of the best estimate of the amount that the company would pay to extinguish the obligation, or to transfer it to third parties upon period end. If the effect of discounting is significant, the allocations are determined by discounting back the expected future financial flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the market's current valuation in relation to time. When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the passing of time is reported as a financial charge. Financial liabilities: financial liabilities include the medium and long-term loans recorded initially at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred and, subsequently, measured at amortised cost, calculated by applying the effective interest rate, net of principal repayments already made. When a condition of a long-term financing contract is violated, on or before the date of the financial statements, causing the liability to become payable on demand, the liability is classified as current, even if the lender has agreed - after the reference date of the financial statements and before the authorization for its publishing - not to require the payment as a result of the breach. The liability is classified as current because, as of the date of the financial statements, the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for at least twelve months after that date.

Other current financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost and are eliminated when they are settled, that is when the specific obligation in the contract is fulfilled, cancelled or has expired.

Trade payables and other payables: trade payables, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, refer to financial liabilities resulting from trade transactions and are recognised at amortised cost. Payables in a currency differing from the account currency are booked at the exchange rate of the day of the operation and, subsequently, are converted at the exchange rate as of the date of financial statements. Any profit or loss deriving from conversion is reported on the income statement.

Other current liabilities: This item includes sundry transactions which are booked at their nominal value, corresponding to their amortised cost.

Derivative financial instruments: The Group holds derivative instruments for the purposes of hedging its exposure to the risk of changes in methane gas and electricity prices. In connection with such activity, the Group has to manage the risks associated with the misalignment between the indexation formulas relating to the purchase of gas and electricity and the indexation formulas linked to the sale of the same commodities. The instruments used to manage the risk related to the volatility of goods prices basically consist in commodity-swap agreements, aimed at pre-establishing the effects on the sales margins irrespective of the changes in market conditions. The transactions which, in accordance with risk management policies, satisfy the requirements of the international accounting standards for hedge accounting, are classified as "hedging transactions" (and recognised as set out below). On the contrary, those which, despite having hedging purposes, do not meet the requirements envisaged by the international standards, are classified as "trading transactions". In this event, the changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur. The fair value is determined based on the reference market value.

Derivatives embedded in financial assets/liabilities are separated and assessed at fair value, except for cases where, in accordance with IAS 39, the strike price of the derivative at the starting date is close to the value determined on the basis of the amortised cost of the reference asset/liability. In this event, the valuation of the embedded derivative is absorbed in the valuation of the asset/financial liability.

Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy based on the methods for determining the fair value itself, or based on the relevance of the information (input) used in determining their value:

(i) Level 1, financial instruments whose fair value is determined on the basis of a price listed in an active market; (ii) Level 2, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which can be observed directly or indirectly on the market. This category includes instruments valued on the basis of market forward curves and short-term contracts for difference; (iii) Level 3, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which cannot be observed on the market, that is using exclusively internal estimates.

The Group, as of 31st December 2015, has only one type of financial instruments on commodities falling within the scope of level 3.

Revenues and costs: revenues and costs are booked on an accrual basis. The revenues from sales and service performance are recognized to the extent to which it possible to determine their fair value, and it is likely that the connected economic benefits will be enjoyed upon transfer of the risks and advantages typical of the property or upon performance of the service. Depending on the type of operation, revenues are entered on the basis of the following specific criteria: · the revenues from natural gas transportation are recognized at the time when the supply or the service are provided -
although not yet invoiced - and are determined by combining estimates with the values recorded during the financial year on the basis of the so-called reference tariffs, in order to determine the restriction on total revenues as provided

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

101

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
for by the regulations issued by the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water; · the revenues for gas sales are recognized at the moment of disbursement and also depend on the type of customer. In
particular, the product sector norms hold that, in relation to customers that have not chosen to utilize the right to directly negotiate the conditions for supplies with the company that sells the gas, mainly consisting of domestic users, the tariffs for natural gas sales are regulated and updated quarterly on the basis of deliberations made by the Authority for Electrical Energy, Gas and Water ("AEEGSI"). · the contributions received by users for connection services or for parcelling works, if not in relation to costs incurred into for network extension, are reported in the Income statement; · the revenues for service performance are recognized with reference to the level of completion of the activity, based on the same criteria applied to works performed upon order. In case it is impossible to determine their value, the revenues will not be not booked until the amounts of the costs incurred into are deemed recovered; · Revenues are entered net of all discounts, rebates and premiums, as well as the taxes directly connected;

As concerns the quantification of consumption, commencing 1st January 2013, the AEEGSI has amended, by resolution 229/2012/R/GAS dated 31st May 2012, the Network Code appointing Snam Rete Gas S.p.A. as the entity in charge of allocating natural gas to the sales companies. The resolution has also amended the deadlines for the publication of the temporary and definitive allocations, which, up to the previous financial year, were performed by local distributors in the three months subsequent to those of consumption, at the end of which the final allocation was definitive. Commencing 1st January 2013, the allocation methods envisage the publication of a first allocation during the month following that of consumption which will be subject to a first adjustment session within the month of May of the following financial year, and undergo further refinement as part of the multi-year adjustment sessions to be carried out in the following years up to the limit of five years. The adjustment sessions modify the first allocations by considering the further information received by local distributors and transmitted to Snam Rete Gas S.p.A.. The regulatory changes described above, therefore, generate a scenario in which it is possible that the amounts allocated in the first phase are adjusted after the terms of approval of the draft financial statements. For the purpose of valuation of revenues for the supply of natural gas to end-customers, given the regulatory change and the adjustments that occur during the following year, the Group has deemed it reasonable, in order to determine the revenues, to balance the cubic meters sold (except the cubic meters consumed by customers subject to monthly reading) with the cubic meters allocated by Snam Rete Gas S.p.A.. The physical quantities allocated during adjustment sessions are subject to valuation in the following year subsequent to the publication of the data made available by Snam Rete Gas S.p.A.. By resolution 250/2015/R/GAS dated 29th May 2014, the AEEGSI approved the request submitted by Snam Rete Gas S.p.A. to perform the 2013 annual session adjustment by the month of May 2015 as part of the first multi-year adjustment session that will affect the financial years 2013 and 2014. Following the decision above, the AEEGSI, with Resolution 276/2015/R/GAS dated 9th June 2015, suspended the payment of the invoices issued subsequent to the first multi-year adjustment session as well as the count of the invoices as part of the activities for monitoring the potential exposure of the system against the user, for the time necessary to conduct the required audits and, in any case, with timelines suitable to ensure the proper execution of the next adjustment session. The recent resolution has consequently outlined a scenario that exposes the Group to assume the positive and negative economic effects arising from the probable modification of the allocated volumes and the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

102

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
volumetric differences that are naturally formed in different parts of the network where natural gas is measured. In this regard, it should be noted that the economic effects that the Group has recorded as a result of the failure to perform the adjustment session affect the financial years 2013 and 2014 as well as the effects accrued in 2015. In order to represent consistently the results achieved by the Group, maintaining a conservative approach and safeguarding the correlation of costs incurred and revenues generated, the directors have considered it appropriate to balance the cubic meters sold during the reference year with the cubic meters allocated by the entity in charge of the balance; however, the economic effects of the measurement differentials of the previous years have been taken into consideration. The coefficient used to separate the revenues generated by the measurement differential is the ratio between the cubic meters placed in the network by the leading distributor and the cubic meters read at the point of redelivery by the distributor itself. This percentage is believed to be a much more reliable estimate, by virtue of the significant amounts of readings recorded during the years being analysed, which include real measurements of almost all the redelivery points. Once the effect resulting from the measurement factor was separated, the residual differential between the volumes allocated by the entity in charge of the balance and the volumes sold to end customers (billed based on actual measurements), will be a probably adjusted. These adjustments will be performed when the first valid correct adjustment session is completed. Based on current regulations or conventions, it is not possible to establish when the results of the first valid adjustment session will be made available to the public.
At the end of financial year 2015, as in 2013 and 2014, the amounts of natural gas valued at purchase and sale may be less than the amounts of gas actually sold.
Public contributions: public contributions are reported when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be received and all relevant conditions are met. When public contributions are linked to costs components, they are reported as income, but are systematically divided up over the periods, so as to be measured to the costs they are intended to offset. In case the contribution is related to an asset, the asset and the contribution are recorded at their nominal value and their recording into the income statement is accounted for progressively along the useful life of the reference asset, with constant shares.
Private contributions: it should be noted that private contributions received up to 31st December 2013 for the construction of connections to users were fully entered in the income statement when the costs for their construction were incurred and the work was commissioned. The contributions received for the construction of these works that were not related to the costs incurred for their construction were suspended in liabilities and recognized in the income statement when the conditions were fulfilled. The private contributions received for the construction of connections to users are recorded from 1st January 2014 in liabilities at the moment of payment and recorded to the income statement from the date of connection construction, consistent with the recognition of costs to which the works refer and their useful life.
Financial income and expensesC income and costs are booked by competence according to the interest accrued on the net value of the relevant financial assets and liabilities, using the actual interest rate.

Income taxes: current taxes are calculated based on an estimate of the income before tax and are entered at the amount that is expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. The rates and tax regulations used to calculate the amount are those issued or basically issued upon year end. Current taxation relating to elements reported directly under assets are reported directly as assets and not on the income statement.
As far as the Tax on Company Revenue is concerned (IRES), Ascopiave and the almost entirety of its subsidiaries benefited for a three-year period 2013 -2015 of the national fiscal consolidation regime pursuant to art. 117/129 of the Single Reference Text on Revenue Taxes (TUIR). This option enabled the calculation of IRES based on a taxable amount equalling to the mathematical sum of the positive and negative taxable amounts of the single companies that comprise the consolidation. AscoHolding S.p.A. acts as consolidating company and determines a single taxable amount for the entire group of companies that are part of the national consolidation regime.
Each of the participating companies (Ascopiave S.p.A., Ascotrade S.p.A., Asm Dg S.r.l., Pasubio Servizi S.r.l., Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A.) transfers its income tax (taxable income or tax loss) to the consolidating company recognizing therefore in the income statement the item "tax consolidation charges" or "tax consolidation income" for an amount equal to the current IRES rate for the financial year (or the loss transferred), that will be paid or used by the parent company Asco Holding S.p.A.. Deferred tax assets are reported against all deductible temporary differences and for tax assets and liabilities brought forward, in the amount in which the existence of suitable future tax income is probable that can make the use of the deductible temporary differences and tax assets and liabilities brought forward applicable, with the exception of the following:
- when deferred payable tax assets connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial reporting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a company merger and that, at the time of the transaction itself, has no effect on the profit of the year calculated for the purposes of the statements, nor on the profit or loss calculated for tax purposes;
- with reference to taxable temporary differences associated with holdings in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, the deferred tax assets are reported only in the amount in which it is probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the immediate future and that there are suitable tax income against which the temporary differences can be used.

Earnings per share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares net of own shares. For the purposes of the calculation of the basic earnings per share, we specify that the numerator is the economic result for the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.

Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the management to provide estimates and assumptions based on complex and/or subjective judgements, estimates based on past experience and assumptions deemed to be reasonable and realistic on the basis of information available at the time of estimate. This affects the values of the assets and

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

104

liabilities reported on the consolidated financial statements, as well as costs and revenues and information relating to potential assets and liabilities as of that date. If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions, which are based on the management's best assessment, differ from the actual circumstances, they shall be modified so as to be appropriate in the period in which the circumstances arise. Estimates are used to report:
· Duration and residual value of the goods in concession: the gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value. Estimates are also used to assess the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry;
· Permanent reductions in the value of non-financial assets: At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there are permanent reductions in the value of all non-financial assets. In particular, goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this requires an estimate of use value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting on the basis of a suitable discount rate. As of 31st December 2015, the book value of goodwill amounts to Euro 80,758 thousand (2014: Euro 80,758 thousand). Further details can be found under Note 1;
· The valuation of the revenues from gas consumption for which the actual reading is not yet available; · Provisions for risks on receivables, obsolete inventories, the useful lives of intangible and tangible fixed assets
and related amortization, employee benefits and payment plans based on stock options (so-called phantom stock option), taxes and provisions for risks and charges. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the variations are immediately reflected in the income statement. In applying the Group accounting principles, the Directors have taken decisions based on the stated discretional evaluations, with a significant effect on the values reported on the statements. However, the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and estimates may determine results that, in the future, will need to be significantly adjusted at the book value of such assets and/or liabilities.

Impairment of assets

The Group performs at least once a year an impairment test on tangible and intangible assets if their useful lives are

indefinite or, more often, in the presence of events suggesting that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In

particular, goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators

exist; this test requires an estimate of use value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based

on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting on the basis of a suitable discount rate.

As of 31st December 2015, the book value of goodwill amounts to Euro 80,758 thousand (2014: Euro 80,758

thousand).

Recognition of Revenue Revenues from the sale of electricity and gas are recognised and recorded upon delivery and include the allocation for the services provided between the date of the last reading and the end of the year, but not yet invoiced. This allocation is based on the customer's daily consumption estimates, on the basis of the historic profile, adjusted to reflect weather conditions or other factors that may affect the consumption under evaluation.

Amortisation and depreciation Amortisation and depreciation are calculated based on the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the concession; the useful life is determined by the directors, with the assistance of technical experts, when the asset is entered in the financial statements; the assessments about the duration of the useful lives are based on historical experience, market conditions and expectations of future events that could affect the useful life, including technological innovations. On a regular basis, the company evaluates technological and sector changes, dismantling and close-down charges and the recovery value in order to update the asset's remaining useful life. This periodic update may lead to a change in the depreciation/amortisation period and thus the depreciation/amortisation quota for future periods.

Duration and residual value of assets under concession: The gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree n. 164/00 (so-called Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value. Estimates are also used to assess the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry.

Provisions for risks These provisions have been devised by adopting the same procedures as in the previous years and by referring to the updated reports prepared by the lawyers and consultants who are examining the disputes, as well as on the basis of the procedural developments of the latter.

Provision for doubtful accounts The provision for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated losses connected with the receivables of the company. Provisions have been established to cover specific cases of insolvency, as well as in relation to expected bad debts estimated based on past experience with respect to receivables with a similar risk profile.

Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis of expectations about the Group's taxable income in future years. The assessment of the expected taxable income for the purpose of accounting for deferred taxes depends on factors that may

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

106

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
vary over time and that might have significant effects on the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Benefits to employees The expenses and related liabilities are calculated on the basis of actuarial assumptions. The effects arising from any changes in these actuarial assumptions are recognised in a specific shareholders' equity reserve.

COMMENTS ON THE MAIN CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
Non-current assets
1. Goodwill Goodwill, equal to Euro 80,758 thousand as of 31st December 2015, is unchanged since 31st December 2014. The amount recognized refers in part to the surplus value created by the delivery of the gas distribution networks by partner municipalities in the period between 1996 and 1999, and in part to the surplus value paid during the acquisition of some company branches related to the distribution and sale of natural gas.

In accordance with International Accounting Standard 36, goodwill is not subject to depreciation, but its impairment is

verified at least annually. In order to determine the recoverable amount, the goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Unit composed of the natural gas distribution activity (gas distribution CGU) and to the Cash Generating Unit consisting in the natural gas sale activity (gas sale CGU). The cash-generating units to which goodwill was allocated are the following:

(Thousands of Euro)
Distribution of natural gas Sales of natural gas Total goodwill

Increase

31.12.2015

The depreciation audit on goodwill has been carried out by comparing the recoverable value of the activities of natural gas distribution and sale with their accounting value, including the goodwill allocated to them. As no reliable criteria exist to evaluate the sale value between the aware and available parties in the activity of gas sale and distribution, other than the criteria put forward in literature to evaluate the branches of a company, the recoverable value of the audited asset is defined by its use value.

The recoverable value of gas sale and distribution financial flow-generating units has been estimated using the Discounted Cash Flow method, discounting back the operating financial flows generated by the assets themselves at a discount rate representative of the cost of capital. The financial flows used to calculate the recoverable value cover the forecasts formulated by the management in the Economic and Financial Plan for the period 2016-2018 approved with resolution of the Board of Directors dated 26th February 2016.

The current sector legislation establishes that the natural gas distribution service is awarded by means of tender procedures in the minimum territorial areas within pre-established time limits. The tenders for the award of the service in the territorial areas where the Group currently holds most of its municipal concessions ­ if the deadlines illustrated in the regulations (recently postponed by Law no. 21/2016) are respected ­ will mainly take place during the two-year period 2017-2018. Although it is reasonable to believe that some tenders will be launched and awarded before 31st December 2018, the Economic and Financial Plan - and consequently also the assessment methods adopted to determine the use value of the gas distribution CGU - is based on the assumption that the Group, during the three-year period 2016-2018, will maintain the management of the current portfolio of concessions.

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
With reference to the activity of gas distribution, it was hypothesised that in the period 2016-2018 the management would generate financial flows in line with those envisaged in the Economic and Financial Plan 2016-2018 while, considering the uncertainty that bears on the renewal of concessions, it has been decided to estimate the final value of the gas distribution CGU by hypothesising two alternative scenarios:

· scenario 1: the Group obtains in 2087 the renewal of all the concessions and credits in effect on 31st December 2015;
· scenario 2: the Group ends the activity of gas distribution in 2018, realising the return value of the plants as per Art. 15 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000;

With reference to scenario 1, the terminal value has been estimated as an estimate of perpetuity as from the last year specified in the financial forecasts, and considering the economic terms and conditions of the renewals. The growth factor (g) used for the purpose of calculating the terminal value, has been estimated at 1.5%, in line with the inflation rate forecasts elaborated by BMI Research and however lower than the inflation target of the European Central Bank.

The cost of capital (WACC) of the gas distribution CGU was calculated assuming:

an average beta unlevered sector coefficient, as indicated by the AEEG in Attachment A of Resolution 583/2015/R/com dated 2nd December 2015; the level of financial leverage (ratio between financial debt and own means) is in line with the financial structure of reference presumed by the AEEG in Attachment A of Resolution 583/2015/R/com dated 2nd December 2015; the market risk equal to 5.5%, on the basis of authoritative academic sources, professional practices, market consensus and the guidance provided by Organismo Italiano di Valutazione (OIV); the Risk-Free Rate adopted - equal to the annual average of net yields on 10-year government bonds as of 31st December 2015. the cost of debt equal to the annual average of 10-year Interest Rate Swap on Euribor, calculated as of 31st December 2015 and increased by a 3% spread; an additional risk premium in order to calculate the cost of equity (Ke) equal to 1%.

On the basis of these elements, the average weighted cost of the post-tax capital is equal to 5.01%. These rates have been used for updating cash flows in the period provided for by the Plan 2016-2018. The cost of capital used to determine the value of the perpetuity and the rate of discounting of the terminal value is equal to 5.64% and was calculated on the basis of the above parameters and providing for an additional risk premium for the calculation of the cost of equity (Ke) of 2.0%, to take into account the uncertainty on the possible renewal of the concessions and their conditions of renewal.

The results obtained have undergone sensitivity tests, in order to find out how the result of this assessment process

might vary depending on the change of profitability parameters assumed in future cash flows, of the growth rate

considered upon determining the terminal value or of the discount rate to discount the cash flows. This analysis has led

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

109

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
the Directors to evaluate that the expected cash flows can absorb normal variations of the parameters highlighted with respect to the sensitivity analyses generally performed in assessment practice.

The Directors have identified - in scenario 1 - which discount rate value and which variation in EBITDA considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 6.0%, or an average decrease in EBITDA equal to 7.6%.

The Directors have finally identified - in scenario 2 - which discount rate value and which variation in plants reimbursement values considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 10.6%, or an average decrease in reimbursement values equal to 19.1%.

The estimate of the recoverable value of the cash generating units requires discretion and the use of estimates by the management. Several factors related to the evolution of the difficult regulatory context could require a reassessment of any impairment losses. The circumstances and events that could cause a further verification of impairment losses are constantly monitored by the Company.

With reference to the activity of natural gas sale, cash flows used to calculate the recoverable value implement the forecasts made by management for the period 2016-2018. The terminal value has been estimated as an estimate of a perpetuity based on results expected for 2018. The growth factor (g) used for the purpose of calculating the terminal value, has been estimated at 1.5%, in line with the inflation rate forecasts elaborated by BMI Research and however lower than the inflation target of the European Central Bank.

The cost of capital (WACC) of the gas sale CGU was calculated assuming:

a) a beta unlevered coefficient determined on the basis of a sample of comparable companies (listed Italian utility companies); stock market prices were observed over a period of two years on a weekly basis;
b) the level of financial leverage (ratio between financial debt and own means) in line with the financial structure of reference (Italian multi-utility companies);
c) a market risk premium equal to 5.5%, on the basis of authoritative academic sources, professional practices, market consensus and the guidance provided by Organismo Italiano di Valutazione (OIV);
d) the Risk-Free Rate adopted - equal to the annual average of net yields on 10-year government bonds as of 31st December 2015;
e) the cost of debt equal to the annual average of 10-year Interest Rate Swap on Euribor, calculated as of 31st December 2015 and increased by a 3% spread;
f) an additional risk premium in order to calculate the cost of equity (Ke) equal to 1%.

On the basis of these elements, the average weighted cost of the post-tax capital is equal to 5.83%. These rates have

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

110

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
been used for updating cash flows in the period provided for by the Plan 2016-2018. The cost of capital used to determine the value of the perpetuity and the rate of discounting of the terminal value is equal to 6.38% and was calculated on the basis of the above parameters and providing for a further additional risk premium or the calculation of the cost of equity (Ke) of 3%, to take into account a fiercer competitive context.

Considering the other hypotheses described, the recoverable value of financial flow-generating units for gas sales is higher than the accounting values and therefore the conditions are not met to proceed to devaluing the goodwill for depreciation.

The results obtained have undergone sensitivity tests, in order to find out how the result of this assessment process might vary depending on the change of profitability parameters assumed in future cash flows, of the growth rate considered upon determining the terminal value or of the discount rate to discount the cash flows. This analysis has led the Directors to evaluate that the expected cash flows can absorb normal variations of the parameters highlighted with respect to the sensitivity analyses generally performed in assessment practice.

The Directors have finally identified which discount rate value and which variation in EBITDA considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Gas Sale CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 21.5%, or an average decrease in EBITDA equal to 73.7%.

The estimate of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units requires discretion and the use of estimates by the management. Several factors could require a reassessment of any impairment losses. The circumstances and events that could cause a further verification of impairment losses are constantly monitored by the Company.

The investments made during the financial year amount to Euro 21,118 thousand and refer to costs incurred for the realization of the infrastructures for natural gas distribution.

Industrial patents and intellectual property rights During the period considered, the item "Industrial patents and intellectual property rights" shows an increase equal to Euro 181 thousand explained by the purchase and development of management software aimed at further streamlining the organisation of field staff operations.

Concessions, licences, trade-marks and similar rights This item includes costs paid to awarding entities (Municipalities) and/or outgoing operators after the award and/or the renewal of the relevant tenders for the assignment of the natural gas distribution service, rather than the costs incurred for the acquisition of licenses. During the year, the item did not register increases and the variation is explained by amortization. The assignments obtained, following the implementation of Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree), are amortized with a useful life of 12 years in compliance with the period provided for by the decree.

Other intangible fixed asset This item includes the fair value of customer lists that result from the acquisition of companies operating in the sale of natural gas and electricity that occurred in previous years. The analysis of customers switching performed at the end of the year has not highlighted any switch-out percentages above the expected depreciation percentage, and therefore its useful life (10 years) has not required any changes or impairments.

Leased plants and machinery The item reports the costs incurred into for the construction of facilities and distribution network of natural gas, the related connections as well as for the installation of measurement and reduction groups. The investments for the construction of infrastructure suitable for the distribution of natural gas amount to Euro 19,975 thousand, and mainly relate to the construction of the distribution plants for natural gas for Euro 2284 thousand, the distribution network for Euro 7,056 thousand, the creation of connections for Euro 4,194 thousand and the installation of meters for Euro 6,347 thousand. The latter are mainly related to the campaign to replace of the so-called traditional meters with electronic meters, in compliance with AEEGSI resolution 155. The infrastructures located in Municipalities in which the invitation to tender for the distribution of natural gas has not been launched, are depreciated by applying the lower amount between the technical life of plants and the useful life indicated by the AEEGSI in tariff regulations. The technical life of plants has been assessed by an independent external expert who has determined the technical obsolescence of the infrastructures.

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
The analysis carried out at the end of the fiscal year as concerns the distribution CGU, performed in order to verify the recoverability of the entire capital invested, has shown no indicators of impairment of the assets recorded.

Intangible assets in progress under concession The item includes the costs incurred into for the building of the natural gas distribution plants and systems constructed partially on a time and materials basis and not completed at the end of the period considered. The item involved investments amounting to Euro 308 thousand.

Shareholdings in joint companies Shareholdings in joint companies increase from Euro 65,453 thousand to Euro 68,078 thousand marking an increase of Euro 2,625 thousand. In particular, the increase is mainly explained by the results achieved in 2015 for Euro 5,957 thousand of which Estenergy S.p.A. Euro 4,149 thousand, ASM Set S.r.l. Euro 818 thousand and Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. Euro 990 thousand, partially offset by the dividends distributed by the jointly controlled companies for Euro 3,318 thousand of which Estenergy S.p.A. Euro 1,953 thousand, ASM Set S.r.l. Euro 681 thousand and Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. Euro 684 thousand, net of the changes due to the remeasurement of defined benefit plans (IAS 19R) for Euro 14 thousand. The valuation of investments in joint ventures using the equity method and the economic and financial data of these companies are shown in the section "Synthesis data as of 31st December 2015 of jointly controlled companies consolidated using the equity method" of the Explanatory Notes.

Shareholdings in affiliate companies Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation The Group has shareholdings in the affiliate Sinergie Italiane S.r.l., company in liquidation, which meets part of the needs for natural gas amounting to 30.94%. The associate closes its financial year on 30th September. The scope of activity of the associate company during the financial year 2014-2015 only included the import of Russian gas and its transfer to the sales companies in which shareholders hold a stake as well as the management of agreements,

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

114

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________

transactions and disputes concerning the regulation of contractual relations, finalised before to the liquidation.

It should be noted that during the month of August 2013, the associate completed the renegotiation of natural gas

purchase prices envisaged by the "Take or pay" agreements with the supplier "Gazprom Export LLC"; the economic

benefit resulting from the renegotiation will be extended to the two-year periods 2013-2014 and 2014-2015.

In September 2015, the affiliate signed the second renegotiation of the long-term agreement with the same supplier,

mainly focussed on the renegotiation of the raw material purchase price. At the same time, it was possible to achieve a

significant reduction in the minimum contractual amounts. The economic effects of this renegotiation will also affect

the three thermal years 2015/2016 - 2017/2018.

Based on the results of the financial statements for the year 2014-2015, as approved by the Shareholders' meeting on 18h December 2015 and on preliminary operating data of financial year 2015-2016 restated in accordance with

international accounting principles, considering the associate on a going concern basis, the accumulated capital deficit

amounts to Euro 17,300 thousand, of which Euro 5,353 thousand attributable to the Ascopiave Group. Given that the capital deficit of the affiliate company as of 31st December 2014 amounted to  22,119 thousand, of which  8,072

thousand attributable to the Ascopiave Group, the Directors have adjusted the related provision for risks and charges

allocated against the capital deficit of the affiliate company for  1,528 thousand, with a positive impact on the profit and loss statement (Euro 1,228 thousand as of 31st December 2014). The essential data of the shareholdings in the subsidiary as of 31st December 2015, 30th September 2015 and 31st

December 2014 are reported below:

Non-current assets are mostly made up of security deposits that the companies selling natural gas have issued for the

monthly payments due for the import of gas from Russia and deposits paid to Gestore Mercati Energetici for the

purchase of energy efficiency certificates. Other non-current assets decrease from Euro 16,741 thousand to Euro 15,366

thousand marking a decrease of Euro 1,375 thousand.

The other items in "Other receivables" are made up of: - Receivables from the Municipality of Creazzo, for a value of  1,678 thousand, which is unchanged since 31st

December 2006, corresponding to the net book value of the distribution plants delivered in June 2005 to the

above-mentioned local authority. The delivery of said infrastructures occurred following the date of expiry of the concession, on 31st December 2004. The value of the receivables from the municipality corresponds to

what the municipality of Creazzo has been asked to retrocede, as per the "Letta" legislative decree, article 15,

paragraph 5, as indemnification of the industrial value of the network, in line with the estimations outlined in a

suitable appraisal. A litigation is going on with the municipality, in order to define the value of the

compensation of the distribution plants delivered to new distributors, whose evolution can be found in the

paragraph "Litigations" of these financial statements.

- Receivables from the Municipality of Santorso, for Euro 748 thousand. The value corresponds to the net book

value of the distribution plants delivered in August 2007 to the same municipality; the delivery of said infrastructures occurred following the date of expiry of the concession, on 31st December 2006. The value of

the receivables from the municipality corresponds to what the municipality of Santorso has been asked to

retrocede as per the "Letta" legislative decree, article 15, paragraph 5, as indemnification of the industrial

value of the network, in line with the estimations outlined in a suitable appraisal.

- Receivables from the municipality of Costabissara, for Euro 1,537 thousand. This amount corresponds to the net book value of the distribution systems delivered on 1st October 2011.

As of 31st December 2015, there are on-going litigations with the municipalities mentioned above in order to define the value of compensation of the delivered distribution systems. The Group, also following the opinion of its legal advisors, believes that the result of the litigation and arbitration procedures is uncertain, for further information please see the paragraph "Litigations" of this annual financial report.

As of 31st December 2015, in the item no non-current financial assets are recorded. The change in the item is explained by the reclassification of the receivables from the Municipality of San Vito Leguzzano, due by 30th June 2016, and the two-year repurchase agreements made in 2014 by the Parent Company upon the acquisition of the remaining 49% of Veritas Energia S.p.A. as reported in the current section of the Balance sheet.

As of 31st December 2015, inventories are equal to Euro 3,577 thousand and show an overall increase equal to Euro 1,095 thousand as compared to 31st December 2014 mainly explained by the storage of natural gas because of the purchase of natural gas at the V.T.P. (Virtual Trading Point) of the subsidiary Ascotrade S.p.A.. In fact, during the year, the Company Ascotrade S.p.A. changed its mode of supply of natural gas and also started stocking the raw material. At the end of the year, the reserves of stored natural gas amounted to Euro 1,980 thousand. In order to adjust the value entered in inventories to the assumed realisable value, a provision amounting to Euro 562 thousand was created, mainly due to the significant drop in raw material prices in the reference markets. The warehouse materials are used for maintenance works or for the construction of distribution plants. In the latter case materials are reclassified as Tangible Fixed Assets once installation is complete. Inventories are entered net of the provision for loss in value of stock, equal to Euro 595 thousand, in order to adapt their value to the opportunities for their clearance or use.

9. Trade receivables The following table shows how the items are broken down for each period considered:

Trade receivables increased from Euro 147,804 thousand to Euro 172,022 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 24,218 thousand. Receivables from customers are owed from national debtors and are expressed net of the billing down payments and are payable within the following 12 months.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
The lower provisions, equal to Euro 6,514 thousand, are mainly explained by the important use due to the intensive activity of cancellation of older receivables for which all the recovery activities have been completed unsuccessfully, and by the lower provision for doubtful accounts made in financial year 2015 as compared to the previous year, due to the good capacity of the existing provisions and the results of the debt collection process by external agencies. In particular, Euro 4,876 thousand of the total uses of the provision for bad debts, which amounts to Euro 10,518 thousand, are attributable to the company Veritas Energia S.p.A.. Commencing 2014, the year in which 100% of capital was acquired, and especially during 2015, an intense credit management activity for the receivables outstanding at the time of purchase was started for Veritas Energia S.p.A.. Subsequent to these operations, the oldest outstanding receivables have been written off, after performing all the activities required by the Group's debt collection policy. The outstanding receivables as of 10th February 2014 equalled Euro 28,085 thousand; of this total amount, as of 31st December 2015, Euro 20,056 thousand were collected and Euro 5,043 thousand were written off, of which Euro 4,142 during 2015 alone.
The changes in the provision for doubtful accounts are shown in the following table:

73,973

Other current assets decreased from Euro 73,973 thousand to Euro 46,518 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 27,455 thousand. The variation is mainly explained by the decrease in receivables from the Agenzia delle Dogane (Customs Office) for Euro 29,845 thousand, the decrease in receivables for tax consolidation for Euro 2,153 thousand and the decrease in VAT receivables for Euro 980 thousand partially offset by the increase in receivables for the tariff and equalisation components towards the Cassa Conguaglio Settore Elettrico for Euro 3,657 thousand and the increase in advance payments to suppliers for Euro 1,709 thousand. The variation of UTF (Customs Office) and Regional/provincial surtax receivables is related to the modality of payment of taxes on consumption based on the monthly billings to end users as opposed to monthly advances envisaged by the tax returns in the first months of the year and based on the consumption of previous year.

4,747 thousand.

The decrease in receivables from jointly controlled companies related to current accounts, is equal to Euro 7,281

thousand, and is attributable to the decrease in the balance towards Estenergy S.p.A. and the decrease in the exposure to Asm Set S.r.l.. Other changes are related to the entry in the current financial assets of the repurchase agreements, expiring on 10th

February 2016, for Euro 2,838 thousand, through the cash deposited in February 2014 by Veritas S.p.A. as a security

deposit envisaged as a guarantee on trade receivables of Veritas Energia S.p.A. when Ascopiave S.p.A. purchased 49% of Veritas Energia S.p.A.. Euro 5,945 thousand of the receivables under guarantee, as of 31st December 2015 were recorded as losses by Veritas

Energia S.p.A. as a result of the activities of debt recovery carried out in financial years 2014 and 2015.

The value of the cash flow hedge reserve as of 31st December 2015 refers to the expected supply flows which will be

recognised at cost (and therefore with effects on the income statement) in the first quarter of 2016.

Assuming a 10% change in the future quotes of natural gas (i.e. TTF Month Ahead) at year-end, upward and downward,

there would be, respectively, an improvement and a worsening of approximately Euro 88 thousand in the balance of the

Equity cash flow hedge reserve; instead, there would be no impact on the Profit and Loss statement due to the total

effectiveness of the hedging relationships analysed.

Reserves for risks and charges decreased from Euro 8,496 thousand to Euro 7,360 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 1,136 thousand. The variation is mainly explained by the decrease in the provisions for risks related to Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation for Euro 1.491 thousand and the adjustment for the settlement of a litigation with employees for Euro 138 thousand partially offset by Euro  300 thousand provision related to labour litigations and Euro 232 thousand for risks connected to current taxes on trade receivables. As of 31st December 2015, the provisions for risks mainly include provisions for risks related to Sinergie Italiane S.r.l.

The liabilities for employee severance indemnities are measured using an actuarial method, its value is therefore sensitive to changes in assumptions. The main assumptions used in the measurement of severance indemnities are the discount rate, the annual average percentage of outgoing employees and the maximum retirement age of employees. The discount rate used for the measurement of the liability resulting from employee severance indemnity is determined with reference to the market yields of high quality fixed-income securities for which the due dates and amounts correspond to the due dates and amounts of future payments envisaged. For this plan, the average discount rate that reflects the estimated due dates and amounts of future payments relating to the 2015 plan is 2.03%. The main hypotheses of the model are:
· mortality rate: survival table ANIA IPS55 · invalidity rate: INPS tables year 2000 · personnel rotation rate: 3.00% · increase in remuneration rate: 3.00% · inflation rate: 1.50% · anticipation rate: 2.00%

The current cost related to work performed is booked under Personnel costs, whereas, the interest cost, equal to Euro 57 thousand, is recognized in the item Financial income and expenses.

Concerning the loan issued by the European Investment Bank, paid in two tranches in 2013 equalling Euro 45,000 thousand, its outstanding debt as of 31st December 2015 is equal to Euro 38,000 thousand, with Euro 3,500 thousand classified in due to banks and short-term loans. The first loan tranche, whose original amount was Euro 35,000 thousand, will be reimbursed in 16 constant six-month instalments between 29th February 2016 and 28th August 2023; an interest rate equal to the six-month Euribor plus a 95.5 basis points spread will be applied. The second loan tranche, whose original amount was Euro 10,000 thousand, will be reimbursed in 16 constant six-month instalments, the first expiring on 27th February 2018 and the last expiring on 27th August 2025; an interest rate equal to the six-month Euribor plus a 71.5 basis points spread will be applied, in addition to the annual cost of 135 basis points related to the guarantee issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A.. As a guarantee of the fulfilment of the obligations associated with the loan agreement, the Parent Company has sold to the European Investment Bank a share of future receivables arising from the reimbursement of the value of assets related to gas distribution concessions. The loan agreement envisages the fulfilment of the following covenants applied to consolidated data and to be checked twice a year:
a) Ebitda / net financial expenses ratio higher than 5; b) Net financial position / Ebitda ratio lower than 3.5. In addition, the bank is entitled to request a reimbursement before the deadlines envisaged by the amortization schedule, in the following cases: a) decrease in project cost below the amount originally envisaged by the contract; b) anticipated reimbursement of non-EIB loans (except revolving lines of credit); c) change in the control of Ascopiave S.p.A. or Asco Holding S.p.A.; d) changes in the regulatory framework, which could jeopardize Ascopiave S.p.A.'s ability to fulfil its obligations; e) loss of concessions, if determining a value for consolidated RAB lower than Euro 300 million. At the end of 2015, the covenants envisaged by the contract were respected since: a) the Ebitda / net financial expenses ratio was equal to 156.34, calculated as the ratio between the Ebitda

consolidated on that date, amounting to Euro 80,983 thousand, and the consolidated net financial expenses, amounting to Euro 518 thousand; b) the net financial position / Ebitda ratio was 1.41, calculated as the ratio between the net financial position consolidated on that date, amounting to Euro 114,037 thousand, and the consolidated Ebitda, amounting to Euro 80,983 thousand.

The medium long-term loan with Unicredit S.p.A. was signed by the Parent Company in 2011, to finance important company aggregation operations. The original amount of the loan was Euro 40,000 thousand and the loan has a sevenyear duration. The prepayment of the loan is set on six-month postponed instalments, from 31st December 2011 to 30th June 2018. During 2015 two instalments of said loan have been paid for Euro 2,857 thousand each, leading to a decrease in the loan itself for Euro 5,714 thousand and to an outstanding debt amounting to Euro 14,286 thousand at the end of the financial year. The interest rate is variable, and it involves a three-month indexation parameter provided for in EURIBOR and a fixed margin to be added to the "spread" parameter. The value of the fixed margin is apt to increase on the basis of the value of the ratio between the consolidated net financial position and the consolidated gross operative margin at the end of each financial year, as reported in the following table:

Along with the terms and conditions provided for to calculate the interest rate to be applied to the financed capital, the continuation of the loan agreement is subject to the following financial and operating terms and conditions:
a) the value of the index described above cannot be higher than 3.5 (covenant modified with notary deed dated 22nd December 2014, this limit was previously equal to 2.75);
b) R.A.B.'s value (Regulatory Asset Base, i.e. the value of the gas network) cannot be lower than Euro 270,000 thousand;
c) the stake of ASCOHOLDING S.p.A. in ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. cannot be lower than 51%. As a guarantee of the fulfilment of the obligations associated with the loan agreements, the Parent Company has sold to Unicredit a share of future receivables arising from the reimbursement of the value of assets related to gas distribution concessions. Subsequent to an agreement reached with Unicredit S.p.A. on 20th November 2015, the annual verification of compliance with financial and operating covenants under a) and b), since 2015 is no longer performed on the Group's consolidated data prepared in accordance with the IFRSs, but on the pro-forma consolidated data based on the sum of the consolidated financial statements and the pro-rata share of the jointly controlled companies. As of 31st December 2015, having complied with the index under letter a), equal to 1.30, calculated as the ratio between the pro-forma net debt on that date, amounting to Euro 112,652 thousand, and the pro-forma EBITDA, equal to Euro 86,636 thousand and with the ratio under letter b), amounting to Euro 394,049 thousand, the spread applied as from 1st January 2016 will be 75 basis points. The following table shows the deadlines of medium- and long-term loans:

12,054 6,849
18,903

31.12.2014

17,221

Other non-current liabilities increased from Euro 17,221 thousand to Euro 18,903 thousand marking an increase of Euro 1,682 thousand. Security deposits refer to deposits of gas and electricity users. Long-term deferred income was recognized against revenues on connections to the gas network and related to the useful life of the gas distribution plants, against revenues on cogeneration plants/heat supply and against revenues on contributions for the construction of distribution network. The suspension of revenues is explained by the content of Law no. 9/2014 which envisages the full deduction of contributions from private individuals from the value of technical assets held under concession within the scope of gas distribution.

19. Non-current financial liabilities The following table shows how the items are broken down for each period considered:

Non-current financial liabilities decreased from Euro 3,327 thousand as of 31st December 2014 to Euro 422 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 2,905 thousand, and mainly include payables to leasing companies due after 12 months. The decrease is explained by the reclassification to current financial liabilities of the amount paid in February 2014 by Veritas S.p.A. to Ascopiave S.p.A. at the time of the acquisition by Ascopiave S.p.A. of 49% of Veritas Energia S.p.A., as a security deposit envisaged as a guarantee of trade receivables of Veritas Energia S.p.A..

Payables for deferred taxation decrease from Euro 23,675 thousand to Euro 19,571 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 4.104 thousand, mainly due to the dynamics of amortizations in the client lists. In calculating the taxes, reference was made to the IRES rate and, where applicable, to the IRAP rate in force, in relation to the tax period which includes the date of 31st December 2015 and at the time when it is estimated that any temporary differences will be carried forward. The total value of the temporary differences and the related amounts on which liabilities for deferred tax were recognized are as follows:

Tax consolidation payables This heading includes the accrued payables to parent company Asco Holding S.p.A., as part of the National Consolidation regime contracts signed by the Group companies with Asco Holding S.p.A.. The balance of the IRES payables accrued for taxation up to 31st December 2015 is Euro 3,020 thousand, with an increase of Euro 1,980 thousand.
Amounts due to employees The amounts due to employees include holidays not taken, deferred remuneration and bonuses earned as of 31st December 2015 but not paid out on that date
VAT payables VAT payables increased by Euro 1,678 thousand as compared to 31st December 2014. The increase in VAT payables is explained by the quarterly compensation of the tax, granted to the subsidiaries selling natural gas, in that they fall within the category of the subjects billing a high number of end customers.
Annual deferred income The change in the item is mainly related to the reclassification from other payables of deferred income on revenues from cogeneration/heat supply.
Annual accrued liabilities Accrued liabilities refer mainly to State fees and the fees granted to local licensing bodies for the extension of the concession for the distribution of natural gas, awaiting the territorial calls for tenders.
UTF payables and Additional Regional/Provincial Tax They relate to amounts payable to the technical department of finance and to the payment of excise duty and additional taxes on natural gas. The balance is explained by the different timing of billing gas consumption to users, in contrast with the monthly payments carried out by the sales company with reference to the previous year. As of 31st December 2015, the Group's total amount of payables is Euro 2,881 thousand.
Other payables These figures increased by Euro 9,747 thousand as compared to 31st December 2014 and mainly include payables to the Authority for Electricity and Gas and Water regarding the new tariff components of transport (Euro 22,458 thousand).
Benefits based on financial instruments The Group grants additional benefits to some employees in strategic positions within the Group. These benefits are based on financial instruments (so-called "long-term incentive plan 2015-2017"). In particular, the plans adopted by the Group include the allocation of rights including acknowledgement in favour of the beneficiaries of an extraordinary payment linked to the reaching of pre-set objectives, the financial regulation of which is based on the trend of the share title.

At the end of the period considered, the Ascopiave Group's revenues amounted to Euro 581,655 thousand, with a

decrease as compared to the previous year of Euro 3,645 thousand.

The revenues from natural gas sale, equalling Euro 472,974 thousand, record a decrease as compared to the same period

of the previous financial year totalling Euro 667 thousand. The decrease is mainly explained by a decline in unit sales

prices, partially offset by higher volumes of natural gas sold to the market (+57.3 million); the volumes in the previous

year had been influenced by particularly mild temperatures. These volumes in fact increase from 763.1 million cubic

meters recorded in 2014 to 820.4 million in 2015.

Revenues recognised in connection to the import of Russian gas amount to Euro 75,942 thousand and until 30th

September 2015 they were regulated under the framework contract signed for the 2014-2015 thermal year with the

reference shipper of the Group. Since the fourth quarter, the Group has been managing independently the quantities of

natural gas imported. The sales revenues recorded, which are integrally correlated with the costs incurred, are mostly

attributable to the sales made at the virtual trading point.

It is to be pointed out that in 2015 no trading activities were performed.

The transportation of natural gas to the distribution network generated revenues for Euro 26,752 thousand, with an increase compared to the previous year of Euro 5,055 thousand, involving the transport of 788.5 million cubic meters (+77.7 million as compared to 2014). The Restriction on total revenues is determined, year after year, on the basis of the number of redelivery points the Company actually served during the reference period, as well as on the reference price, whose values are established and published by the Authority for Electricity and Gas by 15th December of the year before that in which the price becomes effective. At the end of 2015, the revenues from electricity sales amounted to Euro 61,188 thousand, showing a decrease over the previous year of Euro 6,011 thousand. The KWhs sold in 2015 amount to 352.4 million, a decrease of 28.8 million compared to the previous year.

At the end of 2015, revenues from connection services to the distribution network are equal to Euro 1,133 thousand, with an increase of 1,081 thousand as compared to 2014. The revenues from the distribution companies of the Group are fully recognised among the non-current liabilities and posted to the profit and loss statement based on the useful life of the plants built. The revenues derived from services provided by distributors, being equal to Euro 3,563 thousand, basically in line with the previous year (Euro 3,530 thousand.) The revenues from contributions made by the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water amount to Euro 8,871 thousand recording a decrease of Euro 3,684 thousand compared to the previous year. The contributions are paid for the achievement of objectives set by the Authority itself in terms of energy saving and published by resolution, which defines the specific obligations of primary energy savings by the obligated distributors. Other revenues increased from Euro 5,690 thousand in 2014, to Euro 6,003 thousand in 2015, showing an increase of Euro 313 thousand. The item "other revenue" includes contingent assets related to credit entries of energy consumption of previous years for Euro 894 thousand, lower costs of mapping services from previous years for Euro 550 thousand and non-existent debts for the distribution of electricity amounting to Euro 530 thousand.

Costs
28. Cost for gas purchase

Purchase costs for raw material (gas) Purchase costs for raw material (gas)

325,936 325,936

333,335 333,335

At the end of the fiscal year, the costs incurred for the supply of natural gas amount to Euro 325,936 thousand, showing

a decrease of Euro 7,399 thousand as compared to 2014. The decrease in costs incurred is mainly explained by lower

costs for the purchase of the raw material used to supply end customers, which registers a decrease of Euro 7,879

thousand; this decrease is mainly explained by the trend of the price basket to which the raw material is adjusted and

was partially offset by greater consumption during the reference year. During the period, in fact, the procurement

activity involved the purchase of 818.6 million cubic metres, an increase equal to 55.5 million as compared to 2014.The

decrease in the costs incurred for the supply of the raw material intended for the end market was also offset by higher

costs incurred for the import of Russian gas totalling Euro 5,035 thousand.

In the period considered, the company purchased and stored natural gas for a total amount of Euro 1,418 thousand.

It is to be noted that, during the financial period, no trading activities were performed and that the most significant

amounts of natural gas for the supply to end customers were provided to the Ascopiave Group by the company Eni Gas

& Power S.p.A..

At the end of the fiscal year, the costs incurred for the purchase of other raw materials register a decrease equal to Euro 5,537 thousand mainly explained by the lower costs incurred to procure electricity. The costs incurred for the purchase of electricity showed a decrease of Euro 5,836 thousand, from Euro 24,660 thousand, to Euro 18,824 thousand in the reference period. The decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in KWh traded (-28.8 million) which at the end of 2015 amount to 352.43 million. The costs incurred for the purchase of other raw materials register an increase equal to Euro 299 thousand, from Euro 1,372 thousand in 2014 to Euro 1,671 thousand in the reference period. This item mainly includes costs related to the purchase of materials for the construction of natural gas distribution plants.

107,740 thousand in 2014, to Euro 119,151 thousand in the reference period. This variation is mainly explained by the

higher costs totalling Euro 11,371 thousand related to the carriage costs on the primary and secondary networks, for the

transportation of electricity (Euro 1,420 thousand), as well as post and telegraph expenses (Euro 458 thousand). This

increase is partially offset by lower costs for maintenance and repairs (Euro -288 thousand), for consultancy services

(Euro -396 thousand), consumption (Euro -544 thousand) as well as costs connected to use of third party asset (Euro -

1,375 thousand).

The costs incurred for the transportation of natural gas re mainly explained by the increase in consumption recorded in

the period considered (+57.3 million cubic meters).

The decrease recorded in the costs for maintenance and repairs is mainly explained by lower costs incurred for the maintenance of corporate headquarters, which decrease by Euro 221 thousand. The costs incurred for consultancy services increase from Euro 4,527 thousand in 2014, to Euro 4,131 thousand in the reference period. The decrease is mainly explained by lower costs incurred for IT consulting, as well as for administrative and legal advice, which have respectively decreased by Euro 445 thousand and 172 thousand. These decreases have been partially offset by higher technical consultancy costs, which have increased by Euro 220 thousand. The costs incurred for the use of third-party assets, which have decreased by Euro 1,375 thousand, have benefited from lower costs incurred for the purchase of licenses and the reduction in fees paid to Local Authorities.

31. Costs for staff

The following table shows the breakdown of personnel costs in the years considered:

Financial year 2015 Financial year 2014

Wages and salaries Social security contributions Severance indemnity Current severance indemnity actualization Other costs Totale costo del personale Costo del personale capitalizzato Costi del personale

18,607 5,926 1,291

18,895 5,872 1,307 (0) 317
26,391 (3,664) 22,726

The cost for staff is net of costs capitalized by the companies of natural gas distribution in comparison with increases in intangible assets for works performed on a time and material basis, which are directly attributed to the implementation of facilities for the distribution of natural gas and recorded as an asset. Costs for staff decrease from Euro 26,391 thousand in 2014 to Euro 25,987 thousand in the reference period, marking a decrease of Euro 404 thousand. The decrease is mainly explained by the entry of the value of the phantom stock options granted to managers at the time of the listing of the parent company, not exercised yet, performed in the first nine months of the previous financial year, which has entailed higher costs totalling Euro 668 thousand. The decrease was partially offset by wage increases paid during the period due to personal rewards and increases provided for by contract. The capitalized staff cost shows an increase equal to Euro 750 thousand, from Euro 3,664 thousand in the previous fiscal year, to Euro 4,414 thousand in 2015, thus reducing the cost for staff by an equal amount.

Other operating costs, decreasing from Euro 22,733 thousand as of 31st December 2014 to Euro 18,110 thousand in the reference period, show a decrease of Euro 4,623 thousand, mainly due to lower allowances for doubtful accounts for Euro 2,815 thousand, made possible thanks to the appropriate capacity of the bad debt provision, as well as lower costs incurred for the purchase of Energy efficiency certificates equal to Euro 1,270 thousand partially offset by a provision on a receivable from suppliers for credit notes to be received for Euro 551 thousand.

At the end of 2015, the balance between financial income and expenses showed a loss of Euro 518 thousand, a decrease from the previous year of Euro 1,075 thousand. The decrease is explained by the combined effect of the reduction in interest rates applied by banks to lines of credit and by the improvement of the Group's financial position, which reduced the recourse to lines of credit. The item "Evaluation of associated companies using the equity method" amounts to Euro 1,491 thousand and includes the use of a portion of the bad debt provision for the coverage of the capital deficit of the affiliate company Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation following the profit achieved during the period as detailed in the section "Shareholdings" of these explanatory notes. The item registers a decrease as compared to the same period of the previous year equal to Euro 263 thousand. The item "Result quota from jointly controlled companies" includes the net results achieved by the jointly controlled companies in the reference period; they increased by Euro 2,733 thousand compared to the previous year, totalling Euro 5,958 thousand.

Taxes
36. Taxes in the reference period

The table below shows the breakdown of income taxes over the periods considered, distinguishing the current component from the deferred and advance ones:

17,953 3,232
(2,666) 18,519

16,032 3,404
(1,242) 18,194

Taxes increase from Euro 18,194 thousand in 2014 to Euro 18,519 thousand in the reference period, thus registering an increase of Euro 325 thousand. The increase recorded is mainly explained by the higher profit achieved in 2015, which has fully offset the positive effect arising from lower tax rates in force in the two comparison periods to which the companies operating in the sector are subject. The judgement of the Constitutional Court (No. 10 of the year 2015), has in fact declared the unconstitutionality of the IRES additional tax, called Robin Hood Tax, effective from the date of publication of the judgement in the Official Gazette. As a consequence, unlike in the period considered, 2014 also included the taxes related to the IRES additional tax, equal to a tax rate of 6.5%. The change in advance/deferred taxes is mainly due to the adjustment of the amounts accrued for advance tax receivables and payables for deferred tax to the 24% IRES tax rate, which will become effective commencing 1st January 2017.

Risk and uncertainty factors

Management of financial risk: objectives and criteria The investments in the operative activities of the Group mainly consist of bank loans, financial leasing, lease contracts with the possibility of purchase and bank deposits at sight and short-term. The recourse to such forms of investment exposes the Group to the risk connected with the fluctuation of interest tax rate, that successively determine possible

variations on financial costs.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
The operative activity, on the contrary, put the Group on the position of possible receivable risks with the counterparts. The Group, furthermore, is subject to liquidity risks because the available financial resources may not be sufficient to meet its financial obligations, in the terms and deadlines forecast. The Board of Directors re-examines and agrees the policies for risk management, described hereinafter.

Interest rate risks Because of the seasonality of the natural gas business cycle, the Group aims at managing the need for cash by means of temporary and medium-term loans at variable rates. Furthermore the Group manages medium-long term financings at variable rates with primary bank institutions, with an outstanding debt as of 31st December 2015 of Euro 53,456 thousand and due dates between 1st January 2016 and 5th February 2026. Furthermore the Group manages credit lines at fixed rates (loans) for minor amounts, which originated upon assignment of gas distribution networks by local authorities that are now partners of Asco Holding S.p.A. The medium - long term loans are mainly represented by the loan granted in 2011 by Unicredit S.p.A. with an outstanding debt of Euro 14,286 thousand as of 31st December 2015, subject to a securitization operation by the lender, and by the loan issued in August 2013 by the European Investment Bank with an outstanding debt of Euro 38,000 thousand. oth are subject to covenants which are met. For further details please see paragraph no. 17 "Medium- long term loans".

The sensitivity analysis, obtained by simulating a variation on interest tax rates applied on the credit lines of the Group equal to 50 basis points in decrease (with a minimum limit of zero basis points) and 200 basis points in increase, maintaining unchanged all the other variables, leads to an estimation of an effect on the result before taxes which is negative for Euro 2,205 thousand (2014: Euro 2,299 thousand) or positive for Euro 551 thousand (2014: Euro 575 thousand).

Receivable risk The operative activity put the Group in a position of possible receivable risk caused by the missed respect of trading obligations between the counterparts. The Group constantly monitors this type of risk through an appropriate credit management procedure, helped in that sense also by the division of a significant component of accounts receivable. The policy prescribes to fully write down

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

142

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
the receivables that show an older expiry date than the year (that is to say which have expired for over a year) and in any case all the existing receivables from insolvent clients or clients subject to bankruptcy proceedings, and to apply write-down percentages determined by historical series on the most recent receivables, checking the capacity of the allowance for bad debts, so that it can entirely cover all receivables having an ageing higher than 12 months and most receivables expired between 6 and 12 months.

Liquidity risk The liquidity risk concerns the risk of the Group not to dispose of available and sufficient financial resources in order to meet its financial obligations, in the forecast terms and deadlines, due to the impossibility of raising new funds or selling assets on the market, affecting the income statement if the Group is obliged to incur additional costs to meet its obligations, or in case of insolvency entailing risks for the business. The Group constantly aims at highest balance and flexibility of financing sources and uses, minimizing that risk. The two main factors influencing Group liquidity are on the one hand the resources generated or absorbed by the operative or investment assets, on the other hand the expiry characteristics and debt renewal.

Risk of prices of raw materials The company is exposed to the risk of fluctuation of the cost of the raw material due to the misalignment between the baskets of tariff index of natural gas sale and the basket of purchase costs index, which can be different. In order to reduce the afore-stated risk, the company subscribed contracts of provisioning that envisage the almost full coverage of the indexing clauses of cost in the raw material purchase portfolio and of the indexing clauses of price in the sale portfolio. The risk is therefore connected to possible volume mismatchings between the amounts in the final balance underlying the various indexing formulas and the related amounts budgeted on the basis of which the purchase portfolio has been structured.

Risk management and control policy In September 2015, as part of the project aimed at controlling and managing the risks involved in the activity, also connected with the commencement of procurement, the Group deemed it necessary to adopt the following policies for the management and control of business risks:
- "Energy Risk Management and Control" Policy, - "Financial Risk Management and Control" Policy, - "Compliance with EMIR Regulation" Procedure. The "Energy Risk Management and Control" Policy aims to contain the volatility implied by energy risks on overall margins and to stabilise cash flows; the following corporate figures and bodies are involved: - the Board of Directors, responsible for risk guidance and governance, - the newly formed Energy Risks Committee, in charge of overseeing and approving the results of the
monitoring and control of energy risks, composed of the General Manager, the Chief Financial Officer, the Sales SBU Coordinator, the Supply & Pricing Director and the Risk Control Unit Manager, - the Risk Control Unit, responsible for monitoring and controlling energy risks, - the Supply & Pricing Director of the Sales SBU, in charge of managing the portfolio in accordance with the

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
risk limits set annually by the Board of Directors, - the Chief Financial Officer, with the task of supporting the business structures in the management and control
of energy risks, - Internal Auditing, responsible for monitoring activities aimed at ensuring the enforcement of the policy and the
adequacy of the energy risk internal control systems. The "Financial Risk Management and Control" Policy is aimed at maintaining the balance between funding sources and uses, at containing funding costs and stabilising financial flows. The corporate figures and bodies involved are:
- the Board of Directors, responsible for risk guidance and governance, - the General Manager, in charge of overseeing and approving the results of the monitoring and control of
financial risks, - the Chief Financial Officer, responsible for managing and controlling financial risks, - Finance and Treasury, responsible, under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, for operations related
to the management and monitoring of financial risks, - the Management, which supports the Chief Financial Officer in defining the accounting treatment applicable to
risk management operations, - Internal Auditing, responsible for monitoring activities aimed at ensuring the enforcement of the policy and the
adequacy of the financial risk internal control systems. In accordance with the provisions of the "Energy and Financial Risk Management and Control" Policy, the Group will be able to resort to derivatives for hedging purposes, in order to reduce or mitigate those risks. To this end, the "Compliance with EMIR Regulation" Procedure has been approved, which defines the criteria and rules through which the Ascopiave Group fulfils its obligations under the EU Regulation no. 648/2012 ­ European Market Infrastructure Regulation, concerning the risk mitigation techniques associated with the use of derivative hedging instruments, required to make these operations as transparent as possible to the market. The main parties involved in fulfilling these obligations are the Group's Finance and Treasury Department and the Supply & Sale Pricing Director of the Sales SBU, the first in relation to derivatives on interest and exchange rates, the second with reference to commodity derivatives. They will consult the relevant bank officers in order to prepare the reporting activity required by the EMIR Regulation.

Price risk management and methods of accounting presentation The Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to its operations in the gas and electricity sectors; the overall objective of risk management is to reduce the impact on the Group's Income statement of the effects arising from the portfolio purchases and sales as a result of changes in market prices. The risk exposure is currently defined in terms of volumetric gap between the different indexing formulas of contracts in portfolio and taking into consideration, therefore, any natural hedging situations in the portfolio; as concerns risk management activities, the Group uses derivative financial instruments and specifically Swap transactions in order to reduce the overall exposure of the portfolio, through a reduction in the gaps detected between the different formulas. Specifically, the derivative instruments that may be used by the Group are Commodity swaps on the price of gas and/or Contracts For Difference on the price of electricity (actually comparable to Swap contracts); both operating situations involve the periodic swap of a differential between a fixed price and a variable price indexed to a specific market benchmark (such as the TTF index for gas and the PUN for electricity).

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________

The purpose of these instruments is therefore to "fix" the purchase cost or the sales proceeds (thus making them unaffected by changes in market prices) related to the volumes of gas or electricity traded and/or expected at variable prices. From an accounting standpoint, the Group's hedging operations are represented in accordance with the provisions of the International Accounting Standard IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement" and specifically the rules governing hedge accounting. Please find below a summary of the main features of the hedge accounting model applied by the Group: the hedging relationships designated in hedge accounting are classified as cash flow hedges of future purchases and/or sales of gas and/or electricity at variable prices; the types of hedging instruments used by the group (i.e. Commodity Swaps and Contracts For Difference) fall within the definition of derivative provided by IAS 39 and, as such, have the requirements to be designated as hedging instruments; the underlying hedged items are cash flows expected from the purchase and/or sale and, consequently, as forecast transactions, they can be qualified as hedged items; the date of designation of the individual hedging relationships (so-called inception) coincides with the date of signing of negotiated derivatives; at present, it is not possible to designate after the signing of the hedging instruments; each hedging relationship designated in hedge accounting is subject to formalisation through the preparation of a specific Hedging Relationship Documentation (HRD); each hedging relationship is subject to specific efficacy tests aimed at proving the applicability of hedge accounting treatment, as required by IAS 39; the effectiveness of the hedging relationships is periodically tested prospectively at inception date, retrospectively and prospectively at each accounting reporting date (i.e. quarterly) and, finally, retrospectively at the expiration date or upon any discontinuation of the relationship. At each accounting reporting date, the effective portion of the hedging relationship to be recognised in a specific equity reserve is determined, equal to whichever of the following is lower: the cumulative change in fair value of the hedging instrument or the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is determined as a difference as compared to the fair value of the derivative to be recognised in the balance sheet as an asset or liability and is recognised in the Income Statement. The effectiveness of the hedging relationships is measured by the so-called "Dollar Offset Method", that is by comparing the changes in the value of the hedging derivative entered into (hedging instrument) and a hypothetical derivative (Hypothetical Swap - HPS) whose features entail the same changes in fair value that would occur in relation to the underlying transactions as market prices change. Specifically, the hypothetical derivative used for the purposes of the hedging relationships under examination is a Commodity Swap, signed when the hedging relationship is designated, which envisages the collection of a fixed price at market conditions (so-called Par Price) and the payment of a variable price calculated according to the same indexation formula used for the calculation of the purchase cost of the underlying supply. With reference to each hedging relationship, the Par Price value has been calculated individually on the basis of market conditions at the relevant designation dates (inception) and the contractual conditions of the underlying transactions. However, in cases where the price formula of the hedging instrument coincides with that of the underlying transaction, if the difference between the Par Price calculated and the fixed price of the Commodity Swap contract entered into is reasonably attributable to intraday changes in market conditions and/or surcharges applied by the counterparties in the form of fees, the fixed contractual price is assumed as Par price for determining the underlying Hypothetical Swap.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

145

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
The prospective effectiveness test has been performed by simulating, upon the execution of the test, a shift (+/-10%) in the natural gas market prices (i.e. TTF quotes) and by comparing the change in fair value of the hedging derivative and the change in the Hypothetical Swap determined by the simulated fluctuations compared to the current market values. The hedge is considered effective prospectively if the absolute value of the ratio between the two changes calculated falls within a 80-125% range. Retrospectively, a hedging relationship is considered effective through the measurement of the change in fair value of the hedging derivative and the change in the Hypothetical Swap determined by the fluctuations in natural gas market prices (i.e. TTF curves) as compared to the date of designation of the hedging relationship (Cumulative Test). The hedge is considered retrospectively effective if the absolute value of the ratio between the two changes falls within the 80-125% range. On 31st December 2015, for both the existing derivative instruments, whose mark to market totals Euro -252 thousand, the outcome of the prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests is 100%, thus demonstrating a perfect correlation between the fair value of the hedging instrument and the Hypothetical Swap.
Specific risks in the business sectors in which the Group operates
Regulations The activities carried out by the Ascopiave Group in the gas sector are subject to regulations. Directives and regulatory measures adopted in the European Union and by the Italian Government, as well as the resolutions of the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water can have a significant impact on the operations, the operating results and the financial balance. Future changes in the regulatory policy adopted by the European Union or at a national level could have unexpected effects on the regulatory reference framework and, consequently, on the activity and results of the Ascopiave Group.
Seasonal nature of the activity Gas consumption varies considerably on a seasonal basis, with a higher demand during winter, in relation to higher consumption for heating. Such seasonal nature influences the rise in gas sales and supply costs, while other management costs are fixed and evenly supported by the Group during the year. The seasonal nature of the activity also affects the performance of the Group's net financial position, as the active and passive billing cycles are not aligned with each other and also depend on the performance of gas volumes sold and purchased during the year. Therefore, the data and information contained in the interim financial statements do not allow to draw meaningful conclusions as to the overall trend of the year.
Management of Capital The primary objective of the management of the Group's capital is to guarantee that a solid credit rating is maintained, as well as suitable levels of the capital indicator. The Group can adapt the dividends paid to shareholders, reimburse capital or issue new shares. The Group checks its capital by means of a debt/capital ratio. The Group includes financial charges, trade and other payables in its net debt, net of liquid funds and equivalent.

The figures above have been restated subsequent to the application of a different method to allocate (operating and pretax) earnings to the SBUs.

Earnings per share

As required by the IAS 33 accounting standard, the following information is provided about the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the number of shares, net of own shares.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report 2015

149

Ascopiave Group ________________________________________________________________________________________________
For the purposes of calculating the profit per base share, the numbering used the financial result of the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect. The result and the number of ordinary shares used to calculate base earning per share, identified according to the method forecast by IAS 33 are reported below:

Relevant events after the end of 2015
On 18th January 2016, Ascopiave, along with other operators, filed an appeal before the Council of State against the judgement of the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy no. 2221/2015.
In February 2016, the Law no. 21/2016 was approved, which contains provisions governing the distribution of gas. In particular, Article 3 establishes that the time limits for the publication of the tender notices envisaged in the earlier legislation should range from a maximum of 14 months to a minimum of five months, depending on the group to which the Minimum Territorial Area belongs. Subsequent to the expiration of the time limits within which the awarding entities designated by the Municipalities should have published the tender notices, the new legislation provides that the competent Region for the Area grants 6 extra months, after which it may invite tenders by appointing an acting Commissioner. If two months elapse without such appointment, the Ministry of Economic Development, in agreement with the Region, may intervene by appointing its own acting Commissioner. The law has also abolished the penalties under the scope of the Municipalities established by the previous legislation in the event of delayed publication of tender notices.
Significant events after the approval of the draft financial statements
On 18th March 2016, the company AP Reti Gas S.p.A. was established, with a share capital of Euro 200 thousand, fully paid-in, 100% controlled by Ascopiave S.p.A..
Goals and policies of the group
As for the natural gas distribution segment, the Group intends to enhance its portfolio of concessions, aiming at confirming its service provision in the territorial areas served, in which it boasts a significant presence, and at expanding its activities to other fields, with the goal of increasing its market share and strengthen its local leadership. As for the segment of gas sale, the Group intends to implement the necessary actions to safeguard the current levels of profitability in an ever-changing market, through a trade policy focused on the proposition of differential pricing formulas and improvement of the quality of service. In this segment, the Group intends to pursue the objectives of increasing its market share by direct acquisition of new customers, and through extraordinary company mergers and/or partnerships.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ADOPTED IN DRAWING UP THE BALANCE SHEET AS OF 31st DECEMBER 2015
Drafting criteria and compliance with IRFS The Ascopiave S.p.A. balance sheet as of 31st December 2015 was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) adopted by the European Commission as per art. 6 of the Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 19th July 2002, and 9 of Legislative Decree no. 38/2005. The annual financial report was drawn up based on the principle of historical cost, taking into account the adjustments as appropriate, with the exception of the budget items that under IFRS must be recognized at fair value as described in the evaluation criteria and according to the principle of going-concern. The Board of Directors held on March 16, 2015, authorized the publication of these financial statements drawn up based on the accounting records updated to 31st December 2013 and audited by Ernst & Young SpA . These financial statements consist of the Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Cash Flow Statement, drawn up in Euros, as required by art. 2423 of the Civil Code, and by the notes, where, however, the information is given in thousands of Euros.
Financial statements representation The items of the balance sheet are classified into "current" and "non-current"; those in the income statement are classified by their nature; furthermore, the items of income suspended in equity are also highlighted in the comprehensive income. The statement of changes in shareholders' equity reconciles the opening and closing balances of each net equity item, reconciling through the profit or the loss of the FY, operations with shareholders and variations in the net equity. The financial statement has been defined according to the indirect method, by adjusting operating income of nonmonetary components. We believe that these schemes adequately represent the economic situation and financial position of the company.
Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations applied from 1st January 2015
Hereby is a brief description of amendments, improvements and interpretations applicable to financial reports as of 31st December 2015, implemented on 1st January 2015. The application of said principles shall not have effects on the Company, as they relate to instances that are not present in our company or are sole financial reporting provisions. IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability at the earliest when the event related to the payment occurs, in accordance with applicable law. For payments that are due only above a certain minimum threshold, the liability is recognized only when this threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 requires retrospective application. This interpretation is to be applied mandatorily in financial statements beginning on 17th June 2014 or later. Improvements to IFRSs 2011­2013 Cycle On December 2013 IASB issued a document called "Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2011­2013 Cycle" (applicable to statements starting on or after 1st January 2015), as part of an improvement program to the standards. The vast majority

________________________________________________________________________________
of the amendments are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRS or modifications due to previous changes in the IFRS.
Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not adopted ahead of time by the Group
Please find below the standards and interpretations, which, at the date of the consolidated financial statements, had already been issued but were not yet effective.
Changes to IAS 19: Employee benefits: employee contributed benefit plans
On November 2013 IASB issued a document called "Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions". Modifications to IAS 19 allow (but do not make it obligatory) diminishing accounting of current service cost for the contribution period by employees or third parties. Current service cost need not be correlated to the years of service. Said amendments may be applied retroactively to financial statements starting from or after 1st February 2015. Improvements to IFRSs 2011­2013 Cycle On December 2013 IASB issued a document called "Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2011­2013 Cycle" (applicable to statements starting on or after 1st January 2015), as part of an improvement program to the standards. The vast majority of the amendments are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRS or modifications due to previous changes in the IFRS. Amendments are applicable to financial statements starting from or after 1st February 2015.
Changes to IAS 27 ­ Separate financial Statement
In August 2014 IASB published some amendments to IAS 27 ­ Separate financial Statement. The purpose is to enable valuation of share interest in associated companies and joint ventures with the equity method in separate financial statements. Said amendments will be applicable to financial statements starting from 1st January 2016.
Changes to IAS 1: Statement presentation
On December 2014 IASB published a number of amendments to IAS 1. The purpose is to clarify certain doubts regarding obligatory presentations and information, ensuring that company may use their professional judgement when deciding which information they can disclose in their financial statement, focusing on relevant data. Said amendments will be applicable to financial statements starting from 1st January 2016. Improvements to IFRSs 2012­2014 Cycle On December 2013 IASB issued a document called "Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2012­2014 Cycle" (applicable to statements starting on or after 1st January 2016), as part of an improvement program to the standards. The vast majority of the amendments are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRS or modifications due to previous changes in the IFRS. Amendments are applicable to financial statements starting from or after 1st February 2015.

Changes to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification on acceptable amortization and depreciation methods
In May 2014 IASB issued an amendment to IAS 16 ­ property, plants and machinery and IAS 38 ­ Intangible assets. IASB also clarified that the use of earning base methods when calculating amortization is not appropriate as the earning generated by an activity that is the result of the usage of an asset generally includes other factors in addition to simple usage of the asset. IASB furthermore clarified that earning is generally not an adequate measurement of usage of economic assets generated by an intangible property. This general guideline may, however, be overruled in certain determined circumstances. Said amendments will be applicable to financial statements starting from 1st January 2016.

Changes to IFRS 11: Joint agreements: purchase of a joint operation
In May 2014 IASB issued some amendments to IFRS 11 - Joint Agreements: entering of purchase of share interests in joint control activities. The amendments envisage the use of IFRS 3 to enter the accounting effects of purchase of share interests in joint control activities. Said amendments will be applicable retroactively to financial statements starting from 1st January 2016.

Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not adopted ahead of time Hereby is a brief description of amendments, improvements and interpretations that have been already issued but have not been homologated by the European Union and are therefore not applicable to Financial Statements ending 31st December 2015. Principles and interpretations that would find no application in the Company have been excluded.
IFRS 15- Revenues by client contracts
In May 2014 IASB issued the IFRS 15 - Revenues by client contracts. According to this principle, a company needs to account for revenue upon transfer of control of goods or services to its clients, for an amount that is deemed congruous with the sum that the company is expected to receive for said products or services. In order to obtain this, the new entry model defines a five-step process. The new principles also demands additional information regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and financial flows deriving from customer contracts. The new accounting principle will be applied to all yearly statements starting on 1 January 2018 or later. The Company is evaluating the impact of said principle on its consolidated financial statement.
IFRS 9 ­ Financial instruments
In July 2014, IASB published the IFRS 9 ­ Financial instruments. A number of modifications to this new principle supersede the provisions of IAS 39 and introduce a new logical approach to classification and valuation of financial instruments, based on the characteristics of the financial flow and business model, as well as a single model of impairment for financial assets based on expected losses and new approach to hedge accounting. The principle will be applied retroactively from 1st January 2018.
Changes to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment: applications of exceptions to consolidation
In December 2014, IASB published some amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28. Their purpose is to clarify i) investment entities accounting modalities; ii) exemptions to presentation of consolidated statement for companies that control investment entities and iii) how a company that is not an investment entity must apply the valuation with equity method of an investment entity. Said amendments will be applicable to all statements from 1st January 2016.
Changes to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture.
On September 2014 IASB published some amendments to IFRS 10 ­ Consolidated Statement and IAS 28 ­ Share interest in associated companies and joint ventures. Their purpose is to clarify the accounting modalities of results related to sale of assets between companies of a group, associated companies and joint ventures. The process of homologation of said amendments has been paused and their application is not yet determined.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related explanatory notes in compliance with the IFRS requires the management to provide accounting estimates based on complex and/or subjective assumptions, on past experience and

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
hypotheses that are considered reasonable and realistic and that are known at the estimates moment. The use of these estimates affects the values of the assets and liabilities reported on the financial statements and the information relating to potential assets and liabilities as of that date, as well as the amount of revenues and costs in the reference financial year.
Estimates are used to report:
· Duration and residual value of the goods in concession: the gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the length of the concessions, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for Ascopiave S.p.A., between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. Upon expiry of the concessions, the outgoing provider, against the sale of its distribution networks, with the exception of freely transferable assets, receives a compensation defined according to the criteria of business appraisal. In relation to the estimates made by the Management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value;
· the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry;
· Permanent reductions in the value of all non-financial assets: the Group assesses whether there are permanent reductions in the value of all non-financial assets. In particular, goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this requires an estimate of use value of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting on the basis of a suitable discount rate. Further details can be found under Note 1;
· Inventory obsolescence; · Benefit plans for employees and share-based payment plans; · Taxation. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the variations are immediately reflected in the income statement. In applying the Group accounting principles, the directors have taken decisions based on the stated discretional evaluations, with a significant effect on the values reported on the statements. However, the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and estimates may determine results that, in the future, will need to be significantly adjusted at the book value of such assets and/or liabilities.

Assessment criteria The accounting principles adopted by Ascopiave S.p.A. are reported below.

Non-current assets

Goodwill: As of 1st January 2005, goodwill refers to the surplus values paid for the acquisition of distribution companies, as well as to those recognized to the shareholders upon allocation of the distribution network. Goodwill is entered at cost price. As from the transition date of IFRS (1st January 2005), goodwill is no longer depreciated is reduced by any impairment.

Goodwill is subject to an annual recoverability analysis or a more frequent one if events or changes in circumstances

occur which can lead to the emergence of possible losses of value.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
With the intent of analysing the recoverability, the examination is performed at the level of the smallest aggregate on the basis of which the Management evaluates, directly or indirectly, the return on investment (units which generate flows or groups of units) which includes the goodwill itself. Loss of value is determined by defining the recoverable value of a unit which generates flows (or groups of units) to which the goodwill is allocated. When the value entered in the financial statements of the cash generating unit which includes the goodwill attributed to it exceeds the recoverable value, the difference is subject to depreciation attributed as a matter of priority to the goodwill up to its amount; any depreciation surplus with respect to goodwill is ascribed pro-rata at book value of the assets which constitute the cash generating unit. Therefore, the original value is not restored if the reasons that determined the reduction in value cease to exist.
Other intangible fixed assets: Other intangible assets include agreements for service under concession between the public and the private sector (so-called service concession arrangements ) for the development, funding, management and maintenance of infrastructure under concession in which:
(i) the grantor controls or governs the services provided by the operator through the infrastructure and the related price to apply;
(ii) the grantor controls -- through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise -- any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement
Other intangible assets also include the recognition of the fair value of customer lists resulting from the acquisition of companies operating in the sale of natural gas and electricity that occurred in previous year, as well as the recognition of charges paid to the awarding entities (Municipalities) and/or the outgoing operators subsequent to the assignment and/or the renewal of the relevant invitation to tender to award the service of natural gas distribution. As concerns the write-off period:
i) the customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis, based on the estimate of the benefits that will have effects in future years and determined during the Purchase Price Allocation. In particular, the Directors have established that the useful life associated with customer lists is ten years, due to the low turnover rate of customers, represented mainly by civil users;
ii) the concessions for the service of natural gas distribution are amortized on a straight-line basis, based on the duration of the concession period. In particular, the amortization period of the concessions acquired by the Ascopiave Group is equal to twelve years in accordance with the regulatory framework.
After the initial reporting, as they have a defined useful life, intangible assets are booked net of the accumulated relevant amortization operations and net of any losses in value, determined with the same basis indicated below for tangible assets. The useful life is then re-examined on an annual basis, and any changes, if necessary, made prospectively. Assets acquired under financial leases are booked at fair value, net of taxes due by the lessee or, if lower, at the current value of the minimum lease payments, including any sum payable for the exercise of the option to purchase, in intangible assets offsetting the financial debt to the lessor. Any profits or losses deriving from the sale of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the disposal value and the book value of the asset, and are reported on the income statement at the time of the sale.

Duration and residual value of assets under concession: The gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree n. 164/00 (so-called Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, after 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value.
Tangible fixed assets: The tangible assets are booked at their historic cost, including accessory costs directly ascribable to the putting into operation of the asset for the use for which it was acquired. Lands - both free of constructions and annexed to civil and industrial buildings - were generally accounted for separately and are not depreciated since they are elements with an unlimited useful life. Maintenance and repair costs that are not subject to valuing and/or extending the residual useful life of assets are spent in the year in which they are borne. Otherwise, they are capitalized. Tangible assets are presented net of the relevant accumulated depreciation and any losses of value determined according to the basis described below. Amortisation is calculated in uniform instalments on the basis of the estimated useful life of the asset for the company, which is re-examined annually, and any changes, if necessary, are made prospectively.
The main economical-technical rates used are as follows

The book value of tangible fixed assets is subject to verification in order to report any loss of value, should events or changes of situation suggest that the book value may not be recovered. Should there be an indication of this type and in the event that the book value should exceed the presumed realisation value, the assets are depreciated until they reach their realisable value. The realisation value of the tangible fixed assets is represented by the greater of the net sales price and the value of use. Losses of value are reported on the income statement with the costs for amortizations and write downs. Such losses of value are restored should the reasons for their cause cease to exist.

When the asset is sold or if there are no future economic benefits expected from the use of the asset, it is eliminated from the financial statements and any loss or profit (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the book value) is entered in the income statement of the year of the above mentioned elimination.

Share interests:

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

13

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
Share interests entered herein refer to lasting investments. The Company classifies share interests in the following categories:
- Shareholding in subsidiaries - Share interests valued at Equity - Other share interests
Shareholdings: shareholdings in subsidiaries jointly controlled and associated companies are entered at the cost adjusted for any impairment. The value entered in the financial statements is determined on the basis of the purchase or subscription price. Shareholdings in subsidiaries, jointly controlled and associated companies are reviewed annually or, if necessary, more frequently, for impairment detection. The analysis of recoverability of the value entered in the financial statements is performed by comparing this value with the recoverable value, which is the higher between the fair value, net of disposal charges, and the use value. If there is no binding sale agreement, the fair value is estimated on the basis of the values expressed by an active market, by recent transactions or on the basis of the best information available to represent the amount that the company could obtain by selling the asset. The use value is determined by actualizing the asset's expected cash flows and, if considerable and reasonably determinable, by its transfer net of disposal charges. Cash flows are determined on the basis of reasonable assumptions which can be documented and which represent the best estimate of future economic conditions. The actualization is performed at a rate which reflects current market evaluations of the time value of money and of the specific risks of the asset not reflected in cash flow estimates.

Share interests valued at equity: said share interests may be further divided into two categories: (i) Share interests in joint control companies: share interests in joint control companies, in which the company has
control over an entity with a number of other shareholders, are valued with the equity method. Income statement includes the share interest that is property of the Company for the reference year. According to the equity method, share interests are entered in the income statement at their cost, adjusted for possible subsequent variations due to purchase of net assets, net of possible losses of value for each share interest. The excess of purchase cost compared to the percentage of current value of assets, liabilities and potential liabilities that is attributed to the Company upon purchase date is attributed to goodwill. Goodwill is included in the load value of the investment and undergoes impairment tests. (ii) Shareholdings in joint companies: The shareholdings in affiliate companies, i.e. in which the Group has a significant influence, are accounted for using the net equity method. The income statement shows the share of the Group in the operating profit of the affiliate. If an affiliate company detects adjustments directly attributable to the net equity, the Group recognizes its share and includes it, where applicable, in the statement of changes in the net equity. In the event that the loss attributable to the Group exceeds the book value of the shareholding, the latter is cancelled and any excess is recognized in a special fund to the extent that the Group has legal or constructive obligations towards the subsidiary to cover its losses or, however, to make payments on its behalf. If, at a later stage, the loss does no longer exist or has decreased, a reversal of an impairment loss is booked in the income statement, up to its cost.

Shareholdings in other companies: share interests in companies that are not joint companies or joint ventures (normally with a share interest not exceeding 20%) are entered at their fair value if it can be determined. Should the share interest be in companies that are not publicly traded, share interest is valued at their cost of purchase or

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
subscription, minus any repayment of principal, and are subsequently adjusted for losses in value determined in the same manner previously described for the tangible assets.

Other non-current Assets: they are entered at nominal value. Said value may be amended in case of losses of value, for an amount equal to the amortized cost.

Financial Assets The Company classifies financial assets according to the following categories:
Fair value financial assets offset in the P&L account Credits and financings Financial assets held up to their expiry date Financial assets available for sale:
Fair value financial assets offset in the P&L account: this category includes financial assets that were acquired for short-term negotiations as well as derivative instruments. For additional details, please refer to the next paragraph. The fair value of said instruments is determined from their market value at the date of closure of the period under consideration. Variations of fair value of instruments of this category are immediately entered in the P&L account. Their classification as either current or non-current derives from the expectations of administrators regarding their negotiation.

Credits and financings: this category includes credits that do not include derivative instruments and that are not traded in an active market, from which fixed or determinable payments are expected. Said assets are initially entered at fair value and subsequently valued at their amortized cost based on actual interest rates. Should there be an obvious indicator of loss of value, the value of the asset shall be reduced so that its value is equal to the monetary flows that are obtainable in the future: losses of value determined through an impairment test are entered in the P&L account. Should the reason of said depreciation cease to be applicable in future periods, the asset value shall be restored up to the value of the amortized cost should the impairment test never have been applied. Said assets are classified as current assets and instalments due past 12 months are entered as non-current assets.

Financial assets held up to their expiry date: this category includes non-derivative financial instruments with a set expiry that the Company intends and has the power to maintain in its portfolio up to their expiry. Assets that will expire in the following 12 months are all entered as current assets. Should there be an obvious indicator of loss of value, the value of the asset shall be reduced so that its value is equal to the monetary flows that are obtainable in the future: losses of value determined through an impairment test are entered in the P&L account. Should the reason of said depreciation cease to be applicable in future periods, the asset value shall be restored up to the value of the amortized cost should the impairment test never have been applied.

Financial assets available for sale: this category includes non-derivative financial instruments that are especially entered in this category or that may not be classified in any of the previous entries. These assets are valued at their fair value. The fair value is determined with market prices at the financial statement date or interim report, through models of financial evaluation, by determining changes in values, offset by a specific entry in the P&L account. Their

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
classification as either current or non-current derives from the expectations of administrators regarding their negotiation: assets that are expected to be relinquished in the next 12 months are entered as current assets.
Inventories: inventories are booked at whichever of the following is lower: purchase and/or manufacturing cost, determined in accordance with the weighted average cost basis, or the estimated realizable net value. The net realisation value is determined on the basis of the estimated sales price in normal market conditions, net of direct sales costs. Obsolete and/or slow to realize inventories are written down in relation to their presumed possibility of use or future realization. The write down is eliminated in the following years, should the reasons for its cause cease to exist.
Trade receivables and other current assets: trade receivables, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, are not discounted back and are booked at cost (identified by their par value) net of the relevant value losses. These are suited to their presumed realization value through the reporting in a specific adjustment fund, which is constituted when there is objective evidence that the Company will be unable to receive credit for the original value. Provisions to the reserve for doubtful accounts are reported on the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents: they include cash values, values with the following requirements: availability at sight or in a very short term, good outcome, and no collection expenses. They are accounted at nominal value.
Own shares: Re-acquired own shares are taken as a decrease in the assets. The original cost of own shares, revenues from sales and any other subsequent variation are recognized under the net equity.
Benefits for employees: benefits guaranteed to employees, paid when or after employment ceases, by means of programs with defined benefits (Employees' leaving indemnities) or with other long-term benefits (retirement indemnity) are recognized in the period when the right accrues. Company bonds are determined separately for each plan, measuring the current value of future benefits that the employees have accrued in the current year and in the previous ones. This calculation is carried out with the projected unit credit method. The components of the defined benefits are established as follows:
· the re-measurement components of liabilities, which include actuarial profits and losses, are immediately measured in the total Other revenue (losses);
· Costs for the service performances are inscribed at their P&L account value; · Net financial costs on liabilities on defined benefits are entered in the P&L account.
The components found in total Other revenues (losses) may never be reclassified in the P&L account in the following years. For the Severance Indemnity accrued after 1 January 2015 the company is only required to pay contributions to the National Pension Institute or to a Fund or a legally separate entity. Said accrued amount is based on due contributions pursuant to law provisions. Furthermore, the Group has created remuneration plans that are partially paid with Ascopiave S.p.A. shares, by allocating shares created in long-term stock options incentive plans. These are entered as liabilities and valued at their

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

16

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
fair value at the end of each fiscal year up to the moment they will be paid (during the approval of the 2017 yearly statement). Each variation to their fair value is entered in the P&L account. The remaining part of the incentive plan is composed of stock options that may be bought only in cash. The cost of the cash operation is initially valued at their fair value of their allocation date. Specifically, the stock plans of the Group envisage the attribution of rights based on the attainment by its recipients of special goals related to objectives. The financial treatment of these options is based, among other criteria, on the share title trend. Said fair value is paid up to its expiry and a corresponding liability is entered. This liability is calculated at the end of each year end up to and including the year of its payment. Each variation to their fair value is entered in the P&L account. For additional details please refer to "Section II" of the Remuneration Report, as envisaged by Art. 123 ­ par3 of the Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 (so-called Unified Financial Text). During 2015 the remuneration plans of the previous three-year period have been paid. This resulted in the allocation of 99,078 shares. Considering the regulations of the plan, no further allocations have been made during the year, as the benefits will be allocated at the end of the period. Said remuneration plans are accounted pursuant to what is set forth in IFRS 2.
Reserves for risks and charges: The reserves for risks and charges concern costs and charges of a given type, and of certain or probable existence, which on the closing date of the financial year are undetermined in terms of amount or due date. Provisions are reported when:
i) there is a current obligation (legal or implicit) that derives from a past event; ii) an outlay of resources is likely in order to meet the obligation; iii) a reasonable estimate can be made as to the amount of the obligation. On the other hand, where it is not possible to carry out a probable estimate as to the obligation, or alternatively, it is deemed that the outlay of financial resources is only possible and not probably, the relevant potential liability is not marked in the financial statements, but rather mentioned appropriately in the explanatory notes. Provisions are reported at the representative value of the best estimate of the amount that the company would pay to extinguish the obligation, or to transfer it to third parties upon period end. If the effect of discounting is significant, the allocations are determined by discounting back the expected future financial flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the market's current valuation in relation to time. When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the passing of time is reported as a financial charge.
Financial liabilities: financial liabilities include mid to long term financings that are initially entered at fair value net of costs for transactions if applicable and are subsequently valued at their amortized cost, calculated by applying their effective interest rate, net of previous reimbursements. Should the terms of the long term financing agreement be breached before the end of the year with the effect that the liability becomes an account playable on request, the liability is classified as current even if the financing institution agreed, after the closure of the year under scrutiny and before the publishing of the yearly statement, to not demand payment of the sum as result of the agreement breach. The liability is classified as current because, at the date of reference of the statement, the company does not have the unconditional right to defer payment of said liability for at least 12 months from that date.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

17

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
Other current financial liabilities are valued at their amortized cost and are eliminated upon their extinguishment, which is when the agreement obligations is achieved, cancelled or expired.

Trade payables and other liabilities: trade payables, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, are not discounted back and are booked at amortized cost. Payables in a currency differing from the account currency are booked at the exchange rate of the day of the operation and, subsequently, are converted at the exchange rate as of the date of financial statements. Any profit or loss deriving from conversion is reported on the income statement.

Other current liabilities: Include various exchanges and are all booked at face value, corresponding to their amortized cost.

Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value are further classified in a three-tier hierarchy system, based on the modalities in which the fair value itself was determined, i.e. the based to the surety of the input information that was used to determine value:

(i) Tier 1: financial instruments, which fair value is determined based on a share price in a public market; (ii) Tier 2: financial instruments, which fair value is determined with valuation methods that adopt directly or
indirectly observable market parameters. Instruments valued with a forward market curve and short term differential contracts are all part of this tier. (iii) Tier 3: financial instruments, which fair value is determined with valuation methods that adopt valuation systems that are not based on market parameters, i.e. based exclusively on internal estimates.
As of 31st December 2015 the Company solely possesses financial instruments based on commodities that can be included into the third tier of the fair value hierarchy.

Revenues and costs: revenues and costs are booked on an accrual basis. The revenues from sales and service performance are recognized to the extent to which it possible to determine their fair value and it is likely that the connected economic benefits will be enjoyed upon transfer of the risks and advantages typical of the property or upon performance of the service. Depending on the type of operation, revenues are entered on the basis of the following specific criteria:
i) the revenues from natural gas transportation are recognized at the time when the supply or the service are provided - although not yet invoiced - and are determined according to the restriction on total revenues as provided for by the regulations issued by the Authority for Electricity and Gas;
ii) the contributions received by users for connection services or for parcelling works, if not in relation to costs incurred into for network extension, are reported in the Income statement;
iii) the revenues for service performance are recognized with reference to the level of completion of the activity, based on the same criteria applied to works performed upon order. In case it is impossible to determine their value, the revenues will not be not booked until the amounts of the costs incurred into are deemed recovered.

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

18

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
iv) the revenues are entered net of all discounts, rebates and premiums, as well as the fees directly connected with the sale of the commodities and service performance;
Public contributions: public contributions are reported when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be received and all relevant conditions are met. When public contributions are linked to costs components, they are reported as income, but are systematically divided up over the periods, so as to be measured to the costs they are intended to offset. In case the contribution is related to an asset, the asset and the contribution are recorded at their nominal value and their recording into the income statement is accounted for progressively along the useful life of the reference asset, with constant shares.
Private contributions: private contributions received until 31 December 2013 for the construction of users derivations were recorded in full in the income statement when the costs for its realization and for the commissioned work were incurred. The received contributions for these works that were not related to the costs incurred for the realization of the same were suspended in liabilities and attributed in the income statement when the conditions were realized. The private contributions received for the construction of users derivations are recognized as of 1st January 2014 in the liabilities at the time of payment and reattributed in the income statement, as of the date of the connection, in line with the detection of the costs related to the works and to their life.
Financial income and expenses: income and costs are booked by competence according to the interests accrued on the net value of the relevant financial assets and liabilities, using the actual interest rate.

Income taxes: current taxes are calculated based on an estimate of the income before tax and are entered at the amount that is expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. The rates and tax regulations used to calculate the amount are those issued or basically issued upon year end. Current taxation relating to elements reported directly under assets is reported directly as assets and not on the income statement.
As concerns, taxes on companies' income (IRES) Ascopiave S.p.A. decided to join in 2013 for a three-year period the national tax consolidation regime, pursuant to articles 117/129 of the T.U.I.R. (Income Tax Consolidated Act). This option allows the determination of IRES on a taxable base made up of the sum of the negative and positive taxable amounts of companies joining the national tax consolidation regime. AscoHolding S.p.A., in its capacity as consolidating company, determines only one taxable base for the group of companies joining the national tax consolidation regime.
Each member company (Ascopiave S.p.A., Ascotrade S.p.A., Asm Dg S.r.l., Pasubio Servizi S.r.l., Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A.) transfers its income tax (taxable income or tax loss) to the consolidating company; in particular, Ascopiave S.p.A. transfers a taxable income to the consolidating company, recognizing therefore in the income statement the item "tax consolidation charges" for an amount equal to the current IRES rate for the financial year, that will be paid by the parent company AscoHolding S.p.A..

Deferred taxes are calculated using the so-called liability method on the temporary differences resulting from the date of

the statements between the tax values taken as reference for the assets and liabilities and the values reported on the

statements. Deferred tax liabilities are reported against all taxable temporary differences, except for:

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

19

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
i) when deferred payable taxes derive from the initial reporting of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a company merger and that, at the time of the transaction itself, has no effect on the profit of the year calculated for the purposes of the statements, nor on the profit or loss calculated for tax purposes;
ii) with reference to temporary taxable differences associated with holdings in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, should the reversal of the temporary differences be able to be controlled, and it is probable that this does not take place in a foreseeable future;

Earnings per share: the basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the number of shares, net of own shares. For the purposes of calculating the profit per base share, the numbering used the financial result of the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.

Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements and related explanatory notes in compliance with the IFRS requires the management to provide accounting estimates based on complex and/or subjective assumptions, on past experience and hypotheses that are considered reasonable and realistic and that are known at the estimates moment. The use of these estimates affects the values of the assets and liabilities reported on the financial statements and the information relating to potential assets and liabilities as of that date, as well as the amount of revenues and costs in the reference financial year.
Estimates are used to report:
· Duration and residual value of the goods in concession: the gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for Ascopiave S.p.A., between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. Upon expiry of the concessions, the outgoing provider, against the sale of its distribution networks, with the exception of freely transferable assets, receives a compensation defined according to the criteria of business appraisal. In relation to the estimates made by the Management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value;
· the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry;
· Permanent reductions in the value of all non-financial assets: the Group assesses whether there are permanent reductions in the value of all non-financial assets. In particular, goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this requires an estimate of use value of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting on the basis of a suitable discount rate. Further details can be found under Note 1;

· Inventory obsolescence, Benefit plans for employees and share-based payment plans; · Taxation. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the variations are immediately reflected in the income statement. In applying the Group accounting principles, the directors have taken decisions based on the stated discretional evaluations, with a significant effect on the values reported on the statements. However, the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and estimates may determine results that, in the future, will need to be significantly adjusted at the book value of such assets and/or liabilities.

Activity impairment At least every year the Company performs an impairment test on the tangible and intangible assets of indefinite life or when events occur that might result in the irreparable loss of value of the accounted statement value. Specifically, goodwill undergoes verification to assess possible losses at least every year and possibly more frequently if indicators of loss exist. Said verification requires a usage value valuation of the financial flow generating unit on which goodwill is based on, which in turn is based on the expected financial flows of the unit and their actualization with the adequate discount rate. As of 31st December 2015, the accounting value of goodwill is Euro 20,433 thousand (2014 Euro 20,433 thousand)

Acknowledgment of earnings Earnings for sale of electricity and natural gas are acknowledged and accounted upon their supply. They include the performance of service occurred between the last reading date and the year-end that have not been invoiced yet, Said performance is based on estimates of daily usage by the client, based on their history and is adjusted by weather conditions and other factors that may influence estimated consumptions.

Amortizations Amortizations are calculated according to the estimated residual life of the asset or the remaining duration of the concession. Useful life is determined by administrators, with the support of experts, when the asset is first entered in the statement. Estimates regarding useful life are based on history, market conditions and expectations of future events that might influence the useful life itself, including technological advances. The company regularly evaluates technological and sector changes, costs of dismantling/closure of an asset and the salvageable value of an asset when assessing its residual life. Said periodic updating might result in changes in the amortization period and therefore in variations in the amortization instalments for future years.

Duration and residual value of the goods in concession: the gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e.

the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions,

Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new

term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its

distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the

industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net

book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value.

Estimates are also used to assess the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those

with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry;
Provisions for risks Said provisions are set aside using the same procedures as the previous years, based on notifications and advices by consultants and lawyers in charge of proceedings, as well as on the actual developments thereof.
Provisions for doubtful accounts Provisions for doubtful accounts are based on estimated losses related to the account portfolio of the company. Specific insolvency instances have led to the creations of new provisions, as well as expected losses for doubtful accounts based on previous experiences with accounts with similar risk profiles.
Accrued tax credits Accounting of accrued tax credits is based on the expected taxable income of the Company in future years. The valuation of the expected taxable income for the accounting of accrued tax credits is based on a number of factors that may differ in time and have significant effect on the recoverability of tax credits for advanced taxation.
Employee's Benefits Expenses and liabilities related to employee's benefits are based on actuarial estimates. The effects deriving from modifications in said actuarial estimates are entered in a specific Equity entry.
INFORMATION ON MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION ACTIVITIES Ascopiave S.p.A. is not subject to management and coordination activities on the part of AscoHolding S.p.A. since it operates in conditions of corporate and entrepreneurial autonomy with respect to its parent company. Ascopiave S.p.A. avails itself of some services offered by AscoHolding S.p.A. and other subsidiary companies, under market conditions, for organization and economic reasons.

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS ON THE MAIN ITEMS OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Non-current assets
1. Goodwill Goodwill, equal to Euro 20,433 thousand at the end of the reference period, refers in part to the surplus value created by the contribution of the gas distribution networks by the local authorities in the period between 1996 and 1999, and in part to the surplus value paid during the acquisition of some branches of the company related to the distribution of natural gas. In accordance with International Accounting Principle 36, goodwill is not subject to depreciation, but its impairment is verified at least annually. The depreciation audit on goodwill has been carried out by checking the depreciation in the activities of natural gas distribution, comparing the recoverable value of the relevant assets with their accounting value, including the goodwill allocated to them. As no reliable criteria exist to evaluate the sales value between the aware and available parties in the activities of gas distribution, other than the criteria put forward in literature to evaluate the branches of a company, the recoverable value of the audited activity is defined by its use value.
The value recoverable from the financial flow-generating unit in the distribution of natural gas has been estimated using the Discounted Cash Flow method, discounting back the operating financial flows generated by the activity itself at a discount rate representative of the cost of capital. Cash flows used for the calculation of the recoverable value receive the forecasts made by the management in the business plan 2015-2017 approved by the Board of Directors on 26th February 2016.
The current legislation establishes that the natural gas distribution service is provided by means of tender procedures in the territorial areas within pre-established time limits. The tenders for the award of the service in the territorial areas where the Company currently holds the municipal concessions­ if the deadlines illustrated in recent Laws (and extended with Law no. 21/2016) are respected with regards to the tenders publication ­ will mainly take place during the three-year period 2017-2018. Although it is reasonable to believe that some tenders will be issued and awarded before 31st December 2018 - even assuming that the tender procedures have an extended duration - the business plan, and thus the valuation method adopted for determining the value of use of the company's activities, suggests that the same, in the three years 2016-2018, will keep the management of the portfolio of municipal concessions. With reference to the activity of gas distribution, it was hypothesised that in the three-year period 2016-2018 the management would generate financial flows in line with those envisaged in the Economic and Financial Plan 20152017 while, considering the uncertainty that bears on the renewal of concessions, it has been decided to estimate the final value of the company's activities by hypothesising two alternative scenarios:
· Scenario 1: the Company obtains in 2018 the renewal of all the concessions and credits in effect on 31st December 2015.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
· Scenario 2: the Company ends the activity of gas distribution in 2018, realising the return value of the plants as per Art. 15 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000;
With reference to the first scenario, the terminal value has been estimated as an estimate of a perpetuity as from the last year specified in the financial forecasts, and considering the economic terms and conditions of the renewals. The growth factor (g) used for the purpose of calculating final value, estimated at The cost of capital (WACC) of gas distribution was calculated assuming:
a) the sector-average coefficient beta levered, as indicated by the AEEG with Deliberation no. 583/2015/R/com dated 2nd December 2015;
b) the level of financial leverage (ratio between financial debt and own means) is in line with the financial structure of reference presumed by the AEEG with Deliberation no. 583/2015/R/com dated 2nd December 2015;
c) A market risk premium of 5% in line with the market procedure; d) the Risk-Free Rate adopted - equal to net yields on 10-year government bonds recorded as peak value as of
31st December 2015 e) the average cost of debt equal to the annual average of the Euro - Swap to 10 years, calculated at 31st
December 2015, increased by a spread of 3%

On the basis of these elements, the average weighted cost of the post-tax capital will be equal to 5.01%. These rates have been used for updating cash flows in the period provided for by the Plan 2016-2018. The cost of capital used to determine the value of the perpetuity and the rate of discounting of the terminal value is equal to 5.64% and was calculated on the basis of the above parameters and providing for an "additional risk premium" for the calculation of the cost of equity (Ke) of 2%, to take into account the uncertainty on the possible renewal of the concessions and their conditions of renewal.

The results obtained were subjected to sensitivity tests, in order to find as the result of this evaluation process might change depending on the change of the profitability parameters assumed in the future cash flows, the growth rate considered in determining the terminal value or the discount rate to update the cash flow. This analysis has led the Directors to evaluate that the expected cash flows are such that they can absorb normal variations of the parameters highlighted with respect to the sensitivity analysis generally performed in the evaluation process.

The Directors have identified - in scenario 1 - which discount rate value and which variation in EBITDA considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 6.0%, or an average decrease in EBITDA equal to 7.6%.

The Directors have finally identified - in scenario 2 - which discount rate value and which variation in plants reimbursement values considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the

24

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 10.6%, or an average decrease in reimbursement values equal to 19.1%.

The estimate of the recoverable value of the cash generating units requires discretion and the use of estimates by the management. Several factors related to the evolution of the difficult regulatory context could require a reassessment of any impairment losses. The circumstances and events that could cause a further verification of impairment losses are constantly monitored by the Company.

The investments made during the financial year are equal to Euro 18,537 thousand and are mainly related to costs for the construction of infrastructures for natural gas distribution.

Industrial patents and intellectual property rights During the year, the item "Industrial patents and intellectual property rights" saw an increase of Euro 181 thousand, due to purchase and development of a management software suite to increase efficiency of personnel operations on the territory.

Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights They represent the costs for the acquisition of licences and servitude rights connected to the natural gas distribution network. The credit lines obtained after being placed in the tender because of the implementation of the Decree n. 164/00 (Letta Decree), providing that all contracts must be included in the tender by the end of the "transitional period", were amortised in a useful life of twelve years under the period established by the same Decree. During the fiscal year the item has registered some variations for the amortisation shares only

Other intangible fixed assets The item "other tangible fixed assets", amounting to Euro 478 thousand, is related to the construction works of a cogeneration plant near Venice. The goods acquired though financial lease are booked at fair value, net of contributions within the scope of the lessee or, if lower, at the actual value of the minimum payments due for the leasing, including any amount to pay to exercise the purchase option, among the intangible assets in consideration of financial debt towards the lessor. The change during the year is explained by the amortization, the useful life attributed to the tangible fixed assets is equal to the duration of the financial leasing.
Leased plants and machinery The item reports the costs incurred into for the construction of facilities and distribution network of natural gas, the related connections as well as for the installation of measurement and reduction groups. At the end of the financial year, the item shows a net book value of Euro 18,765 thousand mainly relate to the implementation of the distribution network of natural gas for Euro 2,200 thousand, distribution network for Euro 6,714 thousand and to the creation of connections for Euro 3,908 thousand. Investments for the installations of gas meters amount to Euro 5,874 thousand. The latter item is mainly related to the installation of electronic meters in compliance with resolution 155/07 of AEEGSI Infrastructures located in Municipalities where no concession tender for distribution of natural gas was issued are amortized by applying the lesser value between the technical life of plants and useful life as indicated by AEEGSI regarding tariffs. Technical life of plants has been estimated by an external independent expert, who determined the technical obsolescence of the constructed assets. It is noted that the analysis at the end of the year regarding distribution CGU, carried out to determine the recoverability of the entire invested capital, did not highlight loss of value indicators in the entered assets.
Leased intangible fixed assets in progress The item includes the costs incurred into for the building of the natural gas distribution plants and systems constructed partially on a time and materials basis and not completed at the end of the financial year. The item involved investments amounting to Euro 370 thousand, mainly pertaining the accounting reclassification of fixed that at the end of 2014 were still under construction.

Land and buildings This item is mainly made up of the buildings owned in relation to company headquarters, offices and warehouses as well as masonry works for the natural gas decompression chambers. During the year, no significant investments were made and the item variation is due to the amortization of instalments due in the year under scrutiny.

Plants and machinery The item "Plants and machinery" increased from Euro 2,954 thousand in the previous fiscal year, to Euro 2,697 thousand in the fiscal year of reference. The item variation is due to the amortization instalments for the year,

Industrial and commercial equipment In the period considered, the item "Industrial and commercial equipment" registered investments equal to Euro 115 thousand. The item refers to the purchase of equipment for the maintenance service of the distribution plants and for measurement activity.

Other assets The investments made during the first nine months of the year increased the voice "Other assets ", for Euro 461 thousand, and they mainly relate to the costs incurred into for the purchase of hardware for Euro 126 thousand and for the purchase of company vehicles for Euro 328 thousand.

Tangible assets in progress and advance payments This item includes costs for the construction of co-generation plants, partially made in economics, as well as the costs for extraordinary maintenance on company property. During the year, a total of Euro 82 thousand was invested in this item.

It is to be pointed out that the net equity and results for the period of the controlled or jointly controlled companies reported in the tables above refer to financial statements for the periods ended 31st December 2015 and approved by the Boards of Directors of the associated companies. The entry "shareholding in subsidiaries" did not register variations during year under examination. The comparison between the value of the investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures and the share attributable to the Company highlights situations in which the value entered in the financial statement exceeds the total net assets of the subsidiary as of 31st December 2015. At the end of the annual assessment of the eventual reduction of the values entered in the financial statements in Subsidiaries and joint ventures, we proceeded to determine the use value for each. The use value was calculated by using the projected cash flows contained in the 2016-2018 business plans of the individual subsidiaries that have been approved by the Board of Directors on February 26th 2016. Following the results of the impairment tests on the single shareholdings, no depreciation was recognized. The main criteria adopted in evaluating impairment, both in terms of growth rates for other periods than those illustrated on the plans and in terms of discount rate, are consistent with those considered in the impairment tests of the goodwill allocated to the CGU in the consolidated financial statements.

Other non-current assets increase by Euro 165 thousand, going from Euro 4,368 of 2014 to Euro 4,534 thousand of 2015.

The item "Other receivables" in composed by: · Receivables from the local authority of Creazzo, for a value of Euro 2,141 thousand corresponding to the net book value of the distribution plants awarded in June 2005 for the natural expiry of the concession corresponding, pursuant to "Letta" Legislative decree, art. 15 subpar. 5, to the industrial value of the net according to evaluation reported in the experts' examination. During the year 2014, the litigation with the Municipality about the value of the delivered distribution plant ended with the judgment of the Court of Vicenza, which enshrined in Euro 1,678 thousand the value of the refund, leading to a devaluation credit for Euro 463 thousand. The Company maintains good reason to believe it can recover the least recognition of the credit in the following states of the dispute that however is not maintained in writing and has became, as a result of that judgment, a contingent asset. · Receivables from the municipality of Santorso, for Euro 748 thousand. This amount corresponds to the net book value of the distribution plants awarded in August 2007 to the Municipality itself and the delivery of the infrastructures took place after the expiry of the concession on 31st December 2006.The value of the receivable from the municipality of Santorso corresponds to the 'Letta' law, article 15, paragraph 5, as indemnification of the industrial value of the network, in line with the estimations outlined in a suitable appraisal. · Receivables from the municipality of Costabissara, for Euro 1,537 thousand. This amount corresponds to the net book value of the distribution systems delivered on 1st October 2011 to the Municipality; the delivery of infrastructures happened at the natural expiry date of the concession. The value of the credit is equal to the net book value of the divested asset, considered lower than the reconstruction value as per new request of the Local Body.

As of 31st December 2015 there is an ongoing litigation with the municipalities mentioned in order to define the value of compensation of distribution systems delivered. Please refer to paragraph "Litigations" herein for further details.

At year-end 2015, non-current financial assets amount to zero. Figures at the end of the previous year pertained the residual receivables from the Municipality of San Vito di Leguzzano. The reimbursement plan of the Municipality included payments up to 2016 and therefore on 31st December 2015 they have been reclassified as current financial

assets.

The bonds and long-term financial deposits relate to the purchase of ready securities against to two years term made by

cash paid by Veritas SpA by way of security deposit provided as collateral on trade receivables of Veritas Energia SpA at the time of acquisition by Ascopiave SpA of 49% of Veritas Energia S.p.A. for Euro 2,838 thousand.

This sum has been reclassified into "other current financial assets" as per agreement terms with Veritas S.p.A. during

the purchase procedure of the remaining share interest.

7. Advance tax receivables The advance tax receivable go from Euro 9,070 thousand to Euro 8,298 thousand with a decrease of Euro 772 thousand as reported in the following table.

The Company has been performing a full accounting of advance taxes concerning temporary differences between taximposition and balance sheet value, as the Group supposes that future tax-imposition could take up all differences that generated them. In determining the advanced taxes, we referred to IRES (taxes on the companies income) and, where applicable, to the current IRAP at the moment in which the temporary differences are supposed to be deposited again. In particular, a 27.5% IRES tax rate, and a 4.2% IRAP tax rate were applied in accordance with the changes introduced by Law 111 dated 15th July 2011 to art. 23, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 98 dated 6th July 2011. It should be noted that, following approval of Budget Law 2016 (Law no. 2008 dated 28th December 2015) decreasing IRES tax rate from 27.5% to 24% from 1st January 2017, the Company has adjusted the value of tax assets calculated, resulting in a negative effect in the tune of Euro 1080 thousand. The total value of the temporary differences and the amounts on which the deferred tax assets were calculated are as follows:

Inventories are mainly represented by materials used for maintenance or constructions works of the natural gas

distribution plants and they are entered into the balance sheet under the Net Devaluation of Inventory fund in order to

adapt their value to the opportunities for their clearance or use.

At the end of the fiscal year, the item marks a decrease of Euro 256, from Euro 1,987 thousand of the previous year to

Euro 1,731 thousand in the year of reference. The analyses carried out on the codes rotation and on their residual

usability, but especially the effects of the warehouses centralised management, did not require significant depreciations.

Trade receivables are entered net of the advance payments in bills and net of provision for doubtful accounts accrued as of the closing date of the financial year. These receivables are due within the following financial year, and mainly relate to natural gas transportation service on the distribution network. The item increases from Euro 23,181 thousand of the previous fiscal year, to Euro 28,439 thousand of the current financial year, with an increase of Euro 5,258 thousand. The increase is mainly due to increased volumes of natural gas transferred during the third quarter of the year. All receivables from clients are entirely made up of Italian debtors.

The changes in the provision for doubtful accounts are shown in the following table:

' #&

The decrease in the provision for doubtful account is due to the use of a said provision during the year for insolvency (Euro 416 thousand) and subsequent receivables with natural gas sale companies for the transportation service. At the end of the year, no doubtful accounts that would require further provisions have been identified. Trade receivables will be due within the following year and no significant receivable amount has currently expired.

Other current assets showed an increase of Euro 4,777 thousand, from Euro 30,432 thousand in 2014 to Euro 35,209 thousand in 2015. The increase is mainly explained by the increase in receivables in respect of the Equalisation Fund for the electricity sector for Euro 4,723 thousand, by the increase in advances to suppliers for Euro 903 thousand, by higher VAT credits for Euro 651 thousand and decrease in national fiscal consolidation credits by Euro 167 thousand. The increase in receivables from the Electric Sector Compensation Fund are mainly due to the increase in credit component of tariffs for Euro 8,890 thousand, as well as by the increased contribution to the achievement thereof, for Euro 596 thousand in total and by an increased equalization amount at the end of the year for Euro 5,043 thousand.

deposits at major banks with highly rated, benefiting from the interest rate differential. For a better understanding of

changes in the cash flows occurred during the year, please refer to the cash flow statement.

The liability of the severance indemnity is calculated with the actuarial method. Its value is therefore subjected to

variation between the various hypotheses. The main hypothesis used for the measurement of the severance indemnity is

the discount rate, the average yearly employee turnover and maximum retiring age of employees.

The discount rate used to measure the liability deriving from severance indemnity is determined from market trend of

fixed-rate, high quality bonds with due date and amount corresponding to due date and amounts of expected future

payments. For this plan, the average discount rate reflecting the due dates and amounts of future payments for 2015 amounts to 1.49%. The main hypotheses of the model are:
· Mortality rate: IPS55 survival table · Inability rates: INPS tables year 2000 · Personnel rotation rate: 3.00% · Annual probability rate of TFR down payment: 2.00% · Increase in remuneration rate: 3.00% · Inflation rate: 1.50%

8,571 43,829

828 38,000
127 215 14,286 53,456

Medium and long term loans mark a decrease of Euro 9,628 thousand attributed to the reclassification of instalments that will be reimbursed during 2016. Specifically the European Investment Bank financing, which was issued in two payments during 2013 for Euro 45,000 thousand in total as a residual debt of  38,000 thousand as of 31st December 2015 with Euro 3,500 thousand being reclassified as short term payables to banks and financings. The repayment of the first instalment of 35,000 thousand will be carried out in 16 residual six month instalments with a fixed amount, between 29th February 2016 and 28th August 2023, with the application of a Euribor 6 month interest rate increased with a 95.5 base point spread. The second instalment, amounting to Euro 10,000 thousand shall be repaid with 16 six-month instalments with a fixed amount from 27th February 2018 to 28th August 2025 with the application of a Euribor 6 month interest rate increased with a 71.5 base point spread as well as a 135 base point cost related to the guarantee issued by the "Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A." (Deposit and Loan Bank). As guarantee of the obligations covered by the loan agreement, Ascopiave sold to the European Investment Bank a share of future claims arising from the repayment of the residual value of assets related to the Distribution Gas Concessions. In particular, the Agreement envisages that the Company, for the entire duration of the Loan, undertakes to respect the following parameters:
· EBITDA/ Net financial costs > 5;

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2015

36

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
· Net consolidated financial indebtedness/ EBITDA < 3,5 Furthermore, in the following instances the bank institutions may request anticipated reimbursement of the loan:
a) reduction of costs of the project below what was originally set forth in the agreement; b) anticipated reimbursement of non-EIB loans (excluding revolving credit facilities); c) change in control structure of Ascopiave S.p.A. or AscoHolding S.p.A.; d) change in law framework that might hinder Ascopiave S.p.A ability to perform its obligations; e) loss of concessions to an extent that would reduce consolidated RAB below 300 million Euro.

At the end of 2015, all envisaged covenants were respected because: a) EBITDA/ Net financial costs ratio was 156.36, calculated as the ratio between consolidated EBITDA to that date, i.e. Euro 80,983 thousand and consolidated net financial costs Euro 518 thousand. b) Net financial indebtedness/ EBITDA was 1.41, calculated as the ratio between consolidated net financial indebtedness to that date, Euro 114,037 thousand and consolidated EBITDA i.e. Euro 80,983 thousand.

The medium long term loan with Unicredit S.p.A. signed by the Parent Company in 2011 for Euro 40,000 thousand, used to finance crucial company operation for company aggregation purposes, has a seven year duration and a reimbursement plan of six-month instalments, postponed, from 31st December 2011 to 30th June 2018. During the year, two instalments have been repaid for Euro 2,857 each. This led to the reduction of the loan for Euro 5,714 thousand in total and a residual debt at the end of the year of Euro 14,286 thousand. This loan has a variable interest rate, based on the Euribor three month index and a spread margin to be summed to the index. The exact amount of the margin is based on the variations of the value, at the end of each year, of the ratio between net consolidated financial position and gross consolidated operating margin, as shown in the following table:

/6$839 9<9 - ; # ) (C 9 D) (D 9 ) (D

;# %, , , ,

Along with the terms and conditions provided for to calculate the interest rate to be applied to the financed capital, the

continuation of the loan agreement is subject to the following financial and operating terms and conditions:

a) the value of the index described above may not exceed 3.5 (covenants amended by notary deed dated 22nd

December 2014, the previous limit was equal to 2.75);

b) R.A.B. value (Regulatory Asset Base, i.e. the value of the gas network) cannot be lower than Euro 270,000

thousand;

c) the stake of ASCOHOLDING S.p.A. in ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. cannot be lower than 51%.

As collateral for the execution of obligations related to the loan, the company relinquished to Unicredit an interest of

future credit deriving from the reimbursement of the residual value of the assets related to Gas Distribution

Concessions.

Following a negotiation with Unicredit S.p.A. on 20th November 2015, yearly assessment of respect of financial

covenants and operating parameters stated in items a) and b) from 2015 shall no longer carried out on the IFRS

compliant Group consolidated results, but on a pro-forma consolidated report based on the sum of data of consolidated

statement and the pro-quota of joint controlled companies.

As of 31st December 2015, having respected the indicator a), amounting to 1.48, calculated as the pro-forma net

Other non-current liabilities increased from Euro 3,674 thousand to Euro 5,534 thousand, marking an increase of Euro

1,869 thousand.

The change is mainly explained by the increase in long-term deferred detected liabilities in order to suspend the public

and private contributions received for the construction of users derivations. The same are deferred and released to

income over the useful life of the infrastructure built (45 years) and the carrying value of other non-current liabilities

corresponds to the economic value of the same that will be released as from 2017.

Financial non-current liabilities detect a decrease of Euro 2,905 thousand compared to the previous year. This decrement is mainly due to the reclassification into current financial liabilities of the deposit received from Veritas SpA as collateral for trade receivables of Veritas Energia SpA following the acquisition of the remaining shares of the subsidiary Veritas Energia SpA. The decrease in payables to leasing companies is due to the reclassification of other current financial liabilities instalments that pertain year 2016.

Deferred taxes mark a variation from Euro 14,686 thousand, to Euro 12,232 thousand, a decrease of Euro 2,454 thousand. The Company has provided a full accounting of deferred taxes on temporary differences between taxable values and book values. In determining the advanced taxes, we referred to IRES (taxes on the companies income) and, where applicable, to the current IRAP at the moment in which the temporary differences are supposed to be deposited again. In particular, a 27.5% IRES tax rate, and a 4.2% IRAP tax rate were applied in accordance with the changes introduced by Law 111 dated 15th July 2011 to art. 23, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 98 dated 6th July 2011. It should be noted that, following approval of Budget Law 2016 (Law no. 2008 dated 28th December 2015) decreasing IRES tax rate from 27.5% to 24% from 1st January 2017, the Company has adjusted the value of tax assets calculated, resulting in a positive effect in the tune of Euro 1,747 thousand. The total value of the temporary differences and the related amounts on which the liabilities for deferred taxes gave been detected are detailed below:

and short-term loan instalments for Euro 9,628 thousand. The total decrease, amounting to Euro 87,043 thousand, is mainly explained by decreased use of the credit available and connected to arbitrage transactions on interest rates taken near the end of the financial statements as already mentioned in the section on cash which reference is made.

The item increases from Euro 19,407 thousand of the previous fiscal year, to Euro 15,516 thousand of the current financial year, with a decrease of Euro 3,891 thousand. The decrease is mainly explained by the lower allocation of invoices to be received at the term of the year for Euro 3,546 thousand. The item mainly refers to payables due to suppliers for construction works of the natural gas distribution infrastructures as well as to invoices issued for the purchase of energetic efficiency securities for the attainment of 2015 goal. Trade receivables are due within the following year.

At the end of the fiscal year, other current liabilities amount to Euro 31,282 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 12,792 thousand compared to 2014. This increase is mainly due to the variation of the entry "other payables" and VAT payables. "Advances from clients" represent the amounts paid by the customers as a contribution for works of allotments. The entry increases by Euro 563 thousand compared to the previous year, going from Euro 1,512 in 2015 to Euro 949 thousand of the previous year. "Payables to welfare institutions" refers to payables of welfare contributions for the months of November and December that were paid during the first months of 2016. The "amounts due to employees" include holidays not taken, deferred remuneration and bonuses earned as of 31 December 2015 but not paid out on that date. The VAT debt increased in the tune of Euro 967 thousand by virtue of the increased debts in December, net of advance payments. Accrued expenses are mainly related to the state fees, and royalties concessions, accrued in 2015 but not yet paid to the respective local authorities, while the deferred income are mainly related to the suspension of government grants and private contributions received for the construction of derivations of users whose recognition in the income statement in the year 2016 will take place. At the end of the fiscal year, the item "Other payables" amounts to Euro 22,028 thousand, recording an increase as compared to the previous financial year equal to Euro 10,458 thousand. The variation is mainly explained by the increase in payables towards the Electric Sector Compensation Fund (+10,738 thousand of Euro) concerning the tariff components charged to the sales companies operating on the territory where the natural gas distribution network of the Company rests and which are paid to the Fund itself every two months as established by the Authority for Electricity and Gas with resolution ARG/gas 159/08.

FY 2014

2,647 426

2,692 80,404

At the end of the period, the item amounted to Euro 75,766 thousand, with a decrease of Euro 4,639 thousand compared to the previous year. The decrease is mainly explained by the lower AEEGSI contributions (Euro -3,684 thousand), lower "sundry income" (Euro -973 thousand) and lower income from invoices and payments (Euro -426 thousand). The decrease is partially offset by the revenues from general services performed by group companies (Euro +1,175 thousand). The transport service of natural gas on the distribution network generated revenues of Euro 53,784 thousand, decreasing compared to 54,425 thousand in the previous year, mainly because of lower bond total revenue (the so-called VRT) recognized by AEEGSI to distribution companies working in the field. During the year, the distribution of natural gas has involved the transport of 682.1 million cubic meters, compared with 613.9 million of the previous year, recording an increase of 28.2 million mainly due to the particular climatic conditions with particularly mild winter and summer periods. It should be noted that the voice revenues from gas transportation includes a share of equalization equal to Euro 6,872 thousand, decreasing over the previous year by Euro 4,495 thousand due to the lower differential found at the end of the year between revenues charged to sellers for the service of natural gas distribution (contracts because of lower consumption) and the VRT recognized. At year end, revenue from connection services amounts of Euro 97 thousand. At the end of the financial year, revenue from general services to company subsidiaries increased by Euro 132thousand, going from Euro 2,647 thousand of 2014 to Euro 2,515 thousand of the reference year The item includes the income statement items arising out of activities on the meters installed at the end users on behalf of the selling companies. At the end of the financial year, revenue from general services to company subsidiaries increased by Euro 1,175 thousand, going from Euro 7,594 thousand of the previous year to Euro 8,769 thousand of the reference year thanks to the increase in the type of services provided to controlled companies. The item "revenues from AEEG contributions", and the water system are equal to 8,871 thousand Euro, with a decrease of 3,684 thousand Euro. These contributions are allocated for the attainment of the objectives set by the Authority in matters pertaining energy saving; they are published through a Deliberation, which also specifies the specific requirements of primary energy saving by main distributors. Other revenues increased from Euro 2,692 thousand in 2014 to Euro 1,719 thousand in the reference fiscal year,

recording decreases of Euro 973 thousand mainly explained by lower income during the reference year (Euro -494 thousand).
Operating costs
27. Cost of raw materials

The following table reports the costs relating to the purchase of raw materials during the financial periods considered:

(Thousands of Euro)
Purchase of other raw material Purchase costs for other raw materials

FY 2015 FY 2014

The costs for the purchase of other raw materials increase from Euro 1,299 thousand in 2014 to Euro 1,519 thousand in

2015, with a decrease equal to Euro 220 thousand.. The item mainly includes costs for the purchase of materials used

for the construction of infrastructures for natural gas distribution, as well as costs for the purchase of natural gas and

electric power required for the functioning of the co-generation plants.

It is noted that the increase in costs is mainly due to the transfer of warehouse material between Group companies,

which also resulted in the inclusion of the costs of the sold material, offset by the inclusion of revenues from the same

transaction.

28. Costs for services

Costs for services for the relevant periods are analysed in the following table:

(Thousands of Euro)
Costs for counting meters reading Mailing and telegraph costs Maintenance and repairs Consulting services Commercial services and advertisement Sundry suppliers Directors' and Statutory Auditors' fees Insurances Personnel costs Other managing expenses Costs for use of third-party assets

19,705 22,054

The costs for services amount to Euro 19,705 thousand at the end of the period considered, recording decrease as compared to the previous financial year equal to Euro 2,349 thousand. The decrease is mainly explained by lower costs for meter reading services, as well as received consultancies, in addition to a decrease in costs for the usage of third party assets. Costs for the meter reading service mark a decrease of Euro 276, going from 774 of 2014 to Euro 498 of the reference year. The decrease is mainly due to an improvement of pricing for the supply of this service.

________________________________________________________________________________
The decrease in consultancy fees, in the tune of Euro 627 thousand, is due to lower costs during the year for IT consultancy (Euro -388 thousand) as well as decreased legal and administrative fees (Euro -215 thousand). Personnel costs include costs for the management of vehicles assigned to employees, expenses for the canteen service and costs for training and education, and record an increase of Euro 54 thousand compared to the previous year. The increases recorded by the consulting services are mainly explained by higher costs incurred for the development of IT platforms of the Group and whose cost is passed to the beneficiaries. At the end of the previous year these costs were registered under "Other operating expenses" for total Euro 594 thousand. The item "Costs for the use of third-party assets" includes costs for concession fees paid to Local Bodies due to economic compensation, suggested by Ascopiave S.p.A. in order to continue managing the service in the default of the completion of the re-award procedure, which envisages an annual consideration, starting from 2011, equal to an amount calculated on the basis of the formula illustrated in the Supplementary Deed of the Agreement submitted to the Local Bodies for examination and to be signed and recorded as an Administrative Public Deed. At the end of the reference period, the item has decreased by Euro 1,096 thousand, mainly due to decreased concession fees for Euro 276 and decreased costs for software licenses for Euro 687 thousand.

29. Personnel costs

FY 2014
11,691 3,606 797 23
16,117 (3,406) 12,711

Personnel costs are reported net of capitalised costs in relation to increases in intangible assets for works carried out partially on a time and material basis, which are directly attributed to the creation of facilities for the distribution of natural gas. The item decreases from Euro 16,117 thousand of the previous year, to Euro 15,251 thousand of 2014, with a decrease of Euro 866 thousand. The decrease is mainly explained by accounting of value of phantom stock options allocated to company managers at the time the parent company was publicly traded that have not yet been used, as well as the debt related to the long term employee incentive plan that, at the end of the previous year, led to an increase in costs of Euro 663 thousand. Said decrease is partially offset by increase in salaries paid during the reference year, due to personal achievements and work agreements consequences. Capitalized personnel costs increased by Euro 575 thousand, going from Euro 3,406 of the previous year to Euro 3,981 of 2015, decreasing the overall personnel cost by the same amount. The table below shows the number of employees of the Group, divided by category, at the end of 2014 and at the end of 2015:

It is to be noted that some employees of the company hold phantom stock option plans, which during the accounted year

did not accrue any additional cost.

30. Other management costs

Other operating costs for the relevant periods are analysed in the following table:

' #&
Provision for risks on credits Other provisions Membership and AEEG fees Capital losses Extraordinary losses Other taxes Other costs Costs of contracts Energy efficency certificates Other management costs

FY 2015

FY 2014
832 250 407 525 224 652 451 793 10,034 14,169

Other operating costs register decreases of Euro 1,675 thousand compared to the previous year, mainly due to lower costs for the purchase of energy efficiency certificates (Euro -1,268 thousand) and lack of provisions of doubtful accounts (+ Euro 832 thousand). The decrease of the purchase costs of the energy efficiency titles and the increase of specific liabilities are correlated events. During the year the Company carried out an assessment of the periods June 2012 ­ May 2013, June 2013 ­ May 2014, June 2014 ­ May 2015. Said assessment enabled the identification of a valuing criterion for stock transfer purchased by the Italian Electricity Authority, which requires the attribution in 2014 of increased costs for Euro 880 thousand, in addition to the original value of the asset, in the tune of Euro 2,520 thousand. As this assessment was performed in 2015, we attributed this effect to this year, with other management costs. The results of the two years represented are still positive for Euro 1,745 thousand. Regarding the attainment of the energy saving objectives, it is noted that the company availed itself of the possibility of purchasing the missing titles in the first five months of 2016. Other provisions, in the tune of Euro 300 thousand, have been carried out as a consequence of litigations with employees that have now left the company.

The item financial income and costs is positive for Euro 23,347 thousand, decreasing from the 2014 by Euro 10,668, mainly caused by lower dividends distributed to joint companies (Euro -11,177 thousand). The entry "other financial liabilities" marked a decrease of Euro 449 thousand, due to the reduction of interest rates applied by bank institutions to credit lines and the overall improvement of the financial situation, which decreased reliance on said credit lines.

34. Taxation for the period The table below shows the breakdown of income taxes over the periods considered, distinguishing the current component from the deferred and advance ones:

(Thousands of Euro)
IRES current taxes IRAP current taxes (Advance)/Deferred taxes Taxes for the period

Taxation for the reference year increases from Euro 5,175 of 2014 to Euro 5,570 of 2015, with a Euro 395 thousand increase. The decrease is mainly explained by the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities that, following the recent declaration of unconstitutionality of the IRES called "Robin Hood Tax", sanctioned with sentence no. 10 for the

Earnings per share

As required by the IAS 33 accounting standard, the following information is provided about the calculation of basic and

diluted earnings per share.

The earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period by the number of shares, net of own

shares.

In order to calculate the base value of each share, it is specified that the numerator value has been calculated as the

economic result of the year, minus the percentage due to third parties.

There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results

attributable to the holders of ordinary shares.

There are no shares or warrants that could influence the calculation of the diluted earnings per share. Therefore, the

calculation of earnings per share shows the same values as the diluted earnings per share.

The result and the number of ordinary shares used to calculate base earning per share are reported below, pursuant to

accounting principles stated in IAS 33.

Risk coverage policies

Management of Capital Objectives and criteria
The main financial liabilities of Ascopiave S.p.A. include bank loans, financial leasing, lease contracts with the possibility of purchase and short-term and at-sight bank deposits. The main objective of these financial liabilities is to finance the company's operating activities. Ascopiave S.p.A. holds several financial assets such as trade receivables and short-term deposits and reserves that derive directly from the company's operating activity. Trade receivables, as well as financial receivables, are mainly due to the controlled company Ascotrade S.p.A...

The main risks generated by the financial instruments of Ascopiave S.p.A. are the interest rate risk and the liquidity risk. The Board of Directors re-examines and identifies the policies for risk management, described hereinafter.

Interest rate risk The exposure of Ascopiave S.p.A. to the risk of interest rate fluctuation is mainly connected to the variable interest rate loans and financings subscribed with credit institutions, being the Company responsible for managing the financial requirements of the controlled companies. Ascopiave S.p.A.'s policy, depending on the seasonality of the natural gas business cycle, aims to manage the need for cash by means of temporary loans at variable rates that, given their constant change, do not make it possible to suitably cover the interest rate risk, besides presenting medium-long term funding, always with variable rate, with repayment between 2015 and 2026, with an total outstanding debt of Euro 62,400 thousand (2013 Euro 72 985 thousand) as of 31st December 2014 Ascopiave S.p.A. also manages fixed rate loans for non-significant amounts that depend on the granting of the gas distribution networks of the local bodies, now shareholders of Asco Holding S.p.A. Medium and long term loans are mainly related to the loan issued in 2011 by Unicredit S.p.A., with residual balance as of 31st December 2015 Euro 14,286 thousand, which has been subjected to securitization by the issuing bank, as well as the loan issued in August 2013 by the European Investment Bank, with residual balance of Euro 38,000 thousand. Both

loans are subjected to convents that have been respected. Please refer to Paragraph 17 "Medium and Long term Loans" for additional details.

Sensitivity analysis of the interest rate risk

The analysis of sensitivity is performed by simulating a variation of interest rates applied to the lines of credit of the Company, equal to 50 basis points lower (with a minimum of zero basis points) and 200 basis points higher, maintaining all other variables. This leads to the simulation of an income before taxation between the range of minus Euro 2,307 thousand (2014 Euro 2,135 thousand) and plus Euro 577 thousand (2014: Euro 534 thousand).

Receivable risk policy
Credit risk represents the company's exposure to potential losses arising from the counterparts' failure to meet their obligations. The failure or delay in the payment of fees owed may have a negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the Company.
Ascopiave S.p.A. provides its business services to a limited number of operators in the gas sector, the most significant in terms of turnover being Ascotrade S.p.A. The rules for the access of customers to the services offered are determined by the Authority for Electricity and Gas and are provided for in the network codes, i.e. documents that establish, for each type of service, the rules governing the rights and obligations of the parties involved in the delivery of services, and they provide for contract terms and conditions that reduce the risk of default by customers. In particular, the network codes provide for the issuance of adequate guarantees to cover part of the obligations undertaken if the customer does not hold a credit rating issued by major international bodies.

Liquidity risk Ascopiave S.p.A. constantly pursues the aim of maintaining the stability and flexibility between financing sources and uses, in its capacity as treasury manager for the Group. The two main factors influencing the liquidity of Ascopiave S.p.A. are, on the one hand, the resources generated or absorbed by the operating or investment assets, on the other hand, and the expiry and debt renewal characteristics. Under note 17, financial payables are detailed according to their date of expiry, as of 31st December. Liquidity requirements are constantly monitored by the Treasury Department of Ascopiave S.p.A., in order to ensure that financial resources are easily identifiable and collectible, or that appropriate investments are made in relation to cash or cash equivalents.

________________________________________________________________________________
The Administrators believe that the reserves and credit lines currently available, as well as those that will be generated by the operating and financial activities, will allow meeting the requirements connected to investments, management of circulating capital and to the reimbursement of debt upon date of expiry.

Specific risks in the business sector in which the Company operates
Regulations The activities carried out by Ascopiave S.p.A. in the gas sector are subject to regulations. Directives and regulatory measures adopted in the European Union and by the Italian Government, as well as the resolutions of the AEEG can have a significant impact on the operations, the operating results and the financial balance of the Company. Future changes in regulatory policy adopted at a national level could have unexpected effects on the regulatory reference framework and, consequently, on the activity and results of the Company.
Risks relating to bids for the award of new concessions for the distribution of gas As of 31st December 2015, Ascopiave S.p.A. holds 148 concessions (148 in FY 2014) for the distribution of natural gas Nation-wide. In compliance with the regulations in force governing the concessions held by the company, the calls for tenders for the new awards of the gas distribution service will be no longer announced for every single Municipality but exclusively for the territorial areas determined with Ministerial Decrees dated 19th January 2011 and 18th October 2011, and pursuant to the deadlines illustrated in Annex 1 attached to the Ministerial Decree on tender criteria and bid assessment standards, issued on 12th November 2011. With the progressive development of the tenders, the Company may not be awarded to one or more of the new concessions, or it could award them with less favourable terms than the current ones, with possible negative impacts on the operational business and on the economic and financial position, being understood, in case of non-award for those municipalities previously managed by the company, the proceeds of the redemption value estimated in favour of the outgoing operator.
Risks relating quantification of reimbursement by Municipalities With regard to the concessions under which the Ascopiave Group also owns the gas distribution networks, Law no. 9/2014 states that the reimbursement paid by the new operator shall be calculated according to what is envisaged in conventions and contracts and, for those aspects that are not directly set forth by the parties or related to conditions that are not disciplined by the aforementioned contracts and conventions, guidelines on criteria and operating modalities for the evaluation of the reimbursement shall apply instead, including Article 4 paragraph 6 of Law Decree 21 June 2013 no. 69, converted into law and modified by Law 9 August 2013 no. 98. In any case, the redemption value is deducted from the private contributions relating to local assets, valued according to the tariff regulation methodology in force. Furthermore, should the value of the reimbursement exceed the net value of local fixed assets calculated with tariff regulations, net of public and private contributions by more than 10%, the local authority in charge of the concession shall forward the information in detail to the AEEG, pending verification, before the call for tender can be published. The Ministry of Economic Development Decree dated 12 November 2011 no. 266 states that the new operator shall take over property of the plant through the payment of the reimbursement to the old operator, with the exception of the municipality-owned share if applicable.

57

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
Subsequently to the transitional period, the redemption value to the outgoing operator shall be equal to the local net intangible assets, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, calculated with reference to the criteria used by the Authority to determine the distribution tariffs (RAB).
On this point it should be noted that the Authority has recently intervened with Resolution 367/2014 / R / gas, providing that the redemption value, referred to in Article 14, paragraph 8, of the Legislative Decree n. 164/00, at the end of the first period of custody of field is determined as the sum of: a) the residual value of the existing stock at the beginning of the custody period, assessed for all assets subject to transfer for a consideration to the incoming operator in the second custody period depending on the value of reimbursement provided for in Article 5 of the Decree 226/11, recognized to the outgoing operator in during the first period of custody, taking into account the depreciation and disposals recognized for tariff purposes in the custody period; b) the residual value of the new investments made in the custody period and at period end, assessed on the historical cost revalued for the period in which the investments are recognized in the final balance, as provided by Article 56 of the Regulation of tariffs of distribution services and gas metering (RTDG), and by the average of the net value determined on the historical revalued cost basis and on the net value based on valuation methodologies with standard costs, in accordance with paragraph 3.1 of the resolution 573/2013 / R / GAS, for the next period. The Company is protecting its case sheet and income compared to the adverse regulatory changes described as per the terms reported in the paragraph "Territorial areas" of this report.

Territorial areas

During 2011/2012, the regulatory framework of the sector was further defined, in particular with reference to territorial calls for tenders, through the issue of some ministerial decrees, which implemented several authorisations and directions envisaged by legislation.

In particular:

i) the Decree dated 19th January 2011 issued by the Ministry for economic Development in agreement with the Ministry for the Relationship with Regions and Territorial Cohesion, the territorial areas for issuing calls

for tenders to entrust the gas distribution service were identified; with subsequent Decree dated 18th December 2011, the municipalities belonging to each territorial area were also identified (the so-called Territorial Areas Decree);

ii) the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry of Employment and Social Policies on 21st April 2011 contained provisions ruling the social effects connected to the assignment of

the new gas distribution concessions, thus implementing paragraph 6 of art. 28 of Legislative Decree no. 164 issued on 23rd May 2000 (the so-called Workforce Protection Decree); iii) by Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development n. 226 of 12 November 2011 was approved the rules for

the tender criteria and for the evaluation of the tender for the concession of the service of gas distribution

(so-called Decree criteria The enactment of the Ministerial Decrees helped give certainty to the competitive environment within which operators

will move in the next few years, laying the foundations for the process of market opening started with the transposition of European directives, can actually produce the desired benefits.

The Ascopiave Group ­ like many other operators- has favourably welcomed this new regulation framework, deeming

it may create new opportunities for investments and development for average-sized operators, rationalizing the offer on the market. At the end of 2013, the Government issued Law Decree no. 145 dated 23.12.2013, by making changes to the regulatory framework with regard to the determination of the redemption value of the plants due to the outgoing operator at the end of the "Transitional Period". The Decree has been modified and transposed in to Law 9/2014, which changed substantially the original provisions of the Decree in this regard. The Law Decree ­modifying the contents of Article 15 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000, set for that the value of the reimbursement due to previous operators formerly in charge of the concessions during the transitional period should be recalculated according to conventions and contracts and, for those aspects that are not directly set forth by the parties or related to conditions that are not disciplined by the aforementioned contracts and conventions, guidelines on criteria and operating modalities for the evaluation of the reimbursement shall apply instead, following modalities set forth in Article 14, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 and following modifications. In any instance, from value of the reimbursement the private contributions related to assets are subtracted, measured according to the current tariff regulation methodology. In any case, the redemption value is deducted from the private contributions relating to local assets, valued according to the methodology of tariff regulation in force. Furthermore, should the value of the reimbursement exceed the net value of local fixed assets calculated with tariff regulations, net of public and private contributions by more than 10%, the local authority in charge of the concession shall forward the information in detail to the AEEG, pending verification, before the call for tender can be published. Law no. 9/2014 has set forth that the expiry terms stated in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Law Decree 21 June 2013 no. 69, converted into law and modified by Law 9 August 2013 no. 98 shall be extended for four additional months, and that the deadlines set out in Annex 1 to the Regulation of the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development dated 12th November 2011, n. 226 (so-called Decree criteria), concerning the areas falling in the third group of Annex 1 and the relevant terms of Article 3 of that regulation, shall be extended by four months. Law no. 9/2014 has set forth that the expiry terms stated in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Law Decree 21 June 2013 no. 69, converted into law and modified by Law 9 August 2013 no. 98 shall be extended for four additional months, and that the deadlines set out in Annex 1 to the Regulation of the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development dated 12th November 2011, n. 226 (so-called Decree criteria), concerning the areas falling in the third group of Annex 1 and the relevant terms of Article 3 of that regulation, shall be extended by four months. On 6th June 2014 the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development dated 22nd May 2014 was published on the Official Gazette, which approved the "Guidelines on criteria and application procedures for the evaluation of the redemption value of natural gas distribution systems" under Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Legislative Decree no. 69/2013, converted with amendments by Law no. 98/2013 and Article 1, paragraph 16 of the Legislative Decree no. 145/2013, converted with amendments into Law no. 9 / 2014. According to Law no. 9/2014 the "Guidelines on criteria and application procedures for the evaluation of the redemption value of the natural gas distribution plants" define the criteria for the valuation of repayments of plants to integrate those aspects that are not already provided for in the agreements or contracts, and although it is not deducible from the will of the parties. The "Guidelines" have several critical points, not only on the merits of the resulting valuations, but also in terms of scope, that the Ministry has extremely extended, to the point of considering as ineffective all the valuation agreements of the plants concluded between the plant operators and the municipalities after 12th February 2012 (date of entry into force of Decree 226/2011).

Furthermore, the same guidelines are in contrast with the provisions of art. 5 of the Ministerial Decree 226/2011. This discrepancy refers to art. 4, paragraph 6 of the Legislative Decree 69/2013, which makes explicit reference to Article. 5 of the Ministerial Decree 226/2011. In view of these illegalities, Ascopiave SpA challenged the MD on 21st May 2014 (so the Guidelines) before the administrative court (Regional Administrative Court of Lazio). As part of that judgment, the issue of the constitutionality relating to the (basically retroactive) interpretation of the new rules on the deduction of private contributions set by Law 9/2014 was raised. Lastly, with Resolution 310/2014 / R / gas - "Provisions for determining the redemption value of the distribution networks of natural gas", published on 27th June 2014, the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water System approved the provisions for determining the redemption value of the gas distribution networks, as implementation of the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 16 of LD dated 23rd December 2013, n. 145, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 21st February 2014, no. 9. This provision requires the grantor local authority to send to the Authority for verification all the documents containing the detailed calculation of the redemption value (VIR), if this value is higher by more than 10% to RAB. The Authority performs the procedures provided for by Article 1, paragraph 16 of the LD no. 145/13 within the timelimit of 90 days from the date of receipt of the documents by the contracting stations, ensuring priority according to the deadlines for the call of tender publication. By Law no. 116/2014 dated 11th August 2014 (converted by amendments to Law Decree 24th June 2014 n. 91); the legislature has provided a further extension of the time limits for the calls for tender publications. Specifically for the areas belonging to the first group as per Annex 1 to the MD 226/2011, the deadline was postponed by eight months, for the areas belonging to the second, third and fourth groups, the term was postponed by six months and finally for the belonging to the fifth and sixth groups the extension is of four months. Such extensions do not apply to areas which, although falling in the first six groups, are among the areas considered as "earth quake" because more than 15% of the delivery points falls under the municipalities affected by the earthquakes of 20th and 29th May 2012 in accordance with the Annex to the Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance dated 1st June 2012. The same law, making a further amendment to Article 15, Section 5 of the Legislative Decree 2000, has finally determined that the redemption value is to be calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts, provided that they have been concluded before the date of entry into force of the Ministerial Decree of 12th November 2011 n. 226, that is, before 12th February 2012, thus affirming the principle of retroactive application of the Guidelines, which has already been the subject of an appeal of the judicial review filed against the Guidelines. On 14th July 2015, the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Regional Affairs and Autonomies no. 106 dated 20th May 2015 was published in the Official Gazette, amending the decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226 regarding the tender criteria for awarding the gas distribution service. The most significant changes include:
1. the provisions concerning the value of the reimbursement of the plants to be applied in case of absence of specific agreements between the parties occurred before the entry into force of Decree no. 226/2011, which include to a large extent the provisions of the "Guidelines";
2. a higher maximum threshold for the amount of the annual payments that may be offered in tenders to local authorities. This threshold, previously equal to 5% of the portion of the restriction on tariff revenues to cover the local capital costs, has been brought to 10%;

________________________________________________________________________________
3. the treatment of a number of important technical and economic aspects related to the tendered energy efficiency investments, concerning the value of the amounts to be paid to local authorities and the payments to cover the costs of the operator which implements the interventions and gains the related energy efficiency certificates.
During 2015, a number of service tenders were issued, with the territorial area procedure. Many of them did not follow the envisaged lawful procedure, which among other things includes a preliminary analysis by the Authority concerning the value of reimbursement of previous plant operators. This failure to follow the envisaged procedures also pertained the general outlook of the tender and the attachments thereof before its publishing. Furthermore, the majority of tenders also differ, sometimes radically, with Ministry regulations, including as far as the offer evaluation procedures are concerned. Following current regulations, said discrepancies should be justified by the Contracting Authority. In the current outlook, the tender standardization process, which was envisaged by regulations, is severely hindered. There is a definite risk that a number of procedures will be halted due to numerous litigations concerning the current situation.

Subscription, with the Municipalities involved, of a convention for the adoption of a shared procedure aimed at the agreed quantification of the "Residual Industrial Value" of the networks.

The regulatory amendments which replaced each other over the past years and in particular the legislation which

provided for the selection of the operator of the distribution service through the so-called "territorial calls for tenders"

tool, have led to, among other things, the need to determine the Residual Industrial Value (RIV) of the plants owned by

the Operators.

Normally, in relation to this aspect, the concession agreements governed two "paradigmatic" situations, namely:

-

The early redemption (normally governed with reference to Royal Decree no. 2578/1925) and

-

The reimbursement from the (natural) expiration of the concession.

The eventuality of a "force of law" expiration, preceding the effective date of the "contractual" expiration, (as a rule)

was not envisaged (and therefore governed) in the concession deeds.

Substantially, the case in question (earlier termination imposed by law) represents a "third category", in some ways

similar to the exercise of early redemption (from which, however, it differs significantly for the lack of a will

independently formed to that effect by the Body) and in other ways similar to the expiration of the concession term

(which however has not expired).

At least until Ministerial Decree 226/2011, there were no legislative and/or regulatory norms which precisely defined

the methods and criteria to determine the R.I.V. of the plants and which could therefore complement the contractual

clauses, often deficient.

Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 as well, until the recent amendment introduced in the first place with Law Decree

145/2013, and then Law 9/2014, merely referred to Royal Decree 2578/1925, which, however, ratified the method of

the industrial estimate without setting precise assessment parameters.

The situation illustrated above entailed the necessity to define specific agreements with the Municipalities aimed at

reaching a shared estimate of the R.I.V.. Just consider that the lack of such agreements in the past has often led to

administrative and civil/arbitral litigations.

The situation of the Municipalities partners of Asco Holding S.p.A. was even more peculiar in the sense that, with the

latter, there is not a real concession deed in "canonical" form, but various deeds of assignment to Companies ("Azienda

Speciale", at the time). These deeds have ratified, at the same time, the continuation of the award of the service previously provided by the Bim Piave Consortium. It is evident that, as deeds of assignment, a real regulation concerning the purchase and/or the termination of the management was not and could not be envisaged. With the above-mentioned partner Municipalities, Ascopiave has signed a convention which implied hiring a renowned independent competent professional in order for him to determine the fundamental criteria to apply to calculate the RIV of the gas distribution plants. The related negotiated procedure performed adopting the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender ended on 29th August 2011. The expert has written a report on the "Fundamental criteria to calculate the RIV of the natural gas distribution plants located in the Municipalities currently serviced by Ascopiave S.p.A." which was approved on 2nd December 2011 by the Ascopiave Board of Directors and then by all 92 Local Bodies by City Council Resolution. In 2013 Ascopiave submitted the state of consistency and the appreciation of the plants determined applying the criteria set in the Report, offering at the same time its willingness to perform the cross-examination with the Municipalities, aimed at analysing the documents. To date, following the outcome of the technical cross-examination, 87 Municipalities (unchanged figure from 31st December) have approved the residual value. Later, it will be formalized by Administrative Public Act pursuant to art. 11 of Presidential Decree 902/1986. As part of the above process, the reciprocal relations mostly connected to the management of the service were governed as well, since both the payment of "one-off" amounts (2010 ­ signature of supplementary deeds) for Euro 3,869 thousand, and (since 2011) real fees for variable amounts and equal to the difference, if positive, between 30% of the "restriction on revenues" recognized by the tariff regulation and the amount already received by the Municipality itself as a dividend in 2009 (financial statements 2008) are envisaged.

In particular:

·

Euro 3,869 thousand in 2010;

·

Euro 4,993 thousand in 2011;

·

Euro 5,253 thousand in 2012;

·

Euro 5,585 thousand in 2013;

·

Euro 5,268 thousand in 2014 were paid for a total amount of Euro 24,968 thousand.

During 2015 Ascopiave S.p.A. made available to a number of Municipalities in the Treviso 2 ­ North and Venezia 2 ­ Inland and Eastern Veneto Territorial Areas (69 municipalities out of 92) an update on the estimate for plants as of 31st December 2014. In this update, the company applied established evaluation criteria and provided a quantification of value of private contributions that should be detracted from the remaining industrial value of the plants, pursuant to Law 9/2014. Management of Capital
The main purpose of capital management in Ascopiave is to ensure a steady credit rating and adequate levels of capital indicators. Ascopiave S.p.A. may adjust dividends paid to shareholders, reimburse capital or issue new shares.

Relevant events following the end of FY 2015
On 18th January 2016 Ascopiave and other operators have presented an appeal to the State Council against Lombardy Regional Court Sentence no. 2221/2015. On February 2016 the Law 21/2016 passed. This law contained certain provisions regarding gas distribution. Specifically, Art. 3 defines deadlines for the tenders envisaged by previous regulations from a maximum of 14 months to a minimum of 5 months, depending on the Minimum Territorial Area. At the end of the deadline for issuing tenders for the contracting authorities designated by Municipalities, the new norm envisages that the Region may grant additional 6 months to issue the tender. At the end of this period, the Region may issue a tender with a specifically appointed commissioner. Should the commissioner not be appointed in two months, the Ministry of Economic Development might opt to appoint a commissioner, with the agreement of the Region. The Law also overturned economic penalties that were previously inflicted to Municipalities in case of delayed issuing of tenders.

Relevant events following the Statement approval

On 18 March 2016 a 100% Ascopiave S.p.A. owned company was created, AP Reti Gas S.p.A., with share capital Euro 200 thousand, fully paid in.

Litigations
CATEGORY I ­ ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS

As of 31st December 2015, as far as concessions are concerned, no administrative litigations are pending.

CATEGORY II ­ LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS - CIVIL LAW

As of 31st December 2015 the following are pending:

MUNICIPALITY OF CREAZZO: An Arbitration is pending before the Civil Court of Vicenza between Ascopiave and the Municipality of Creazzo for the establishment of the industrial residual value of the distribution plants (delivered in 2005 to the new operator). The Appeal Court of Venice, with Sentence no. 2178/15, accepted the appeal of the Municipality, confirming the validity and applicability of the arbitration clause set forth in the convention and thus overruling the first-degree sentence dated 25th August 2014, with which the Judge had condemned the Municipality to the payment of Euro 1,678 thousand. While a monetary settlement is likely and advisable, we prudentially filed a claim to initiate the arbitration procedure, to avoid possible closure of the ligation consequently to the 2178/15 Sentence on 11 December 2015.

CATEGORY III ­ LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS ­ ARBITRATIONS

As of 31st December 2015 the following are pending:

MUNICIPALITY OF COSTABISSARA: An arbitration is pending between Ascopiave and the Municipality of Costabissara for the establishment of the industrial residual value of the distribution plants (delivered in to the new operator during FY 2011). The Arbitration Commission held its first meeting on 16th January 2012. Given the disagreement on this point between the parties, with a partial arbitral award, the Commission has confirmed the enforcement of the same clause. With a final Arbitration award on 25th-26th May 2015, the Commission ordered the Municipality to pay the sum of Euro 3,473 thousand, in addition to the interests at the date of filing the Award. In the same Measure the costs of the procedure were quantified in Euro 210 thousand (plus VAT, Lawyers' social security fund and overheads), two-thirds of which under the scope of the Municipality and one third under the scope of Ascopiave S.p.A.. The Award was declared enforceable by the Court of Vicenza on 7th July 2015. The Municipality, with deed notified on 12th December 2015, contested said resolution at the Appeal Court of Venice.

MUNICIPALITY OF SANTORSO: An arbitration is pending between Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Municipality of Santorso for the establishment of the residual industrial value of the distribution plants (delivered in 2007 to the new operator). The start of the procedure

________________________________________________________________________________
was necessary as a result of the Judgment dated 4th September 2013 by which the Judge declared that the Court of Vicenza has no jurisdiction for the validity of the arbitral clause set forth in the original Agreement. Noting the failure of attempts to amicable settlement, on 12th November 2013, Ascopiave S.p.A. served the litigation notice with the appointment of the party Arbitrator. The Municipality, by resolution dated 26th November 2013, appointed its Arbitrator. By decision of the President of the Court of Vicenza dated 31st January 2014 (taken upon request by Ascopiave) the third Arbitrator and the Chairman of the Panel were appointed. The Municipality has contested this procedure (also set forth in the concession agreement) supporting the applicability of the new law dated 2012 which, amending the Public Contracts Code, introduced a peculiar regulation with respect to the arbitration proceedings with the Public Bodies which envisages, among other things, the appointment of the third Arbitrator by the Court of Arbitration of AVCP (Authority for the Supervision of Public Contracts for works, services and supplies). The Authority has adhered to the request, envisaging a retroactive application of the new rule and introducing a sort of supervening invalidity of the arbitral clauses. In this perspective it has scheduled the draw of the third Arbitrator on 17th April 2014. Ascopiave S.p.A. has always expressed its opposition to this formulation (most recently with the note to the AVCP dated 15th April 2014) and therefore considers the Panel perfectly formed, which, moreover, at its meeting held on 14th April 2014, confirmed its legitimacy. AVCP's Chamber of Arbitration has submitted the extract of the minutes of the meeting held on 17th April 2014 which ratified the acknowledgement of Ascopiave S.p.A.'s communication. Therefore, the proceeding was declared extinguished. The Municipality's defence has renewed its application to AVCP, while Ascopiave S.p.A.'s lawyer has reaffirmed the position of the Parent Company in another letter dated 12th June 2014. The Panel, in hearings held on 26th June 2014 and 7th July 2014 dealt with the issue envisaging a partial award on the matter and establishing the deadlines for the Parties' briefs on 30th September 2014 and 15th October 2014. The recent Law Decree 90/2014, whose article 19 has abolished AVCP, could have a significant impact on the matter. The Parties have submitted their respective briefs (and replies) within the specified time limits. With a partial award dated 10th January 2015, the Panel confirmed the legitimacy of its constitution and therefore the full legitimacy to proceed. With order dated 27th February 2015, the Panel set an investigation by a court-appointed expert to determine the value of the plants. The investigations are currently in progress, regarding which, following the request of the court-appointed expert witness, the Chairman of the Panel has extended the original deadline by 45 days. The activities should therefore be completed by 30th November 2015. At the hearing dated 21st December 2015 the Council set forth the deadlines for the presentation of the defence (1st February 2016) in response to the Expert Witness reports.

CATEGORY IV ­ PENDING ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS - NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2015 the following are pending:

ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. ­ HEADQUARTERS EXTENSION: An appeal before the Council of State filed by the company Setten Genesio S.p.A., for the tender involving the construction of the new company headquarters and aimed at obtaining the review of the sentence no. 6335/2010 issued by the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto that, despite admitting the appeal filed by the company and thereby annulling the tender acts, rejected the request for compensation for damage (for about Euro 1,300 thousand) against Ascopiave and the company Carron S.p.A.. In order to obtain the review of the First Instance Sentence, Ascopiave S.p.A. has filed an incidental appeal. Currently

65

Ascopiave S.p.A.
________________________________________________________________________________
the only important proceeding concerns the request for an appeal on 10th May, 2011. Should none of the parties take any other action, the non-suit is scheduled in 2016. By a communication dated 29th September 2015, however, the Lawyer of the company reported that the Council of State, Section V, scheduled the public Hearing for the discussion of the appeal on 24th November 2015. The main issue will be focused on the claim for damages pursuant to the Criminal Code (Euro 1,300 thousand), in relation to which the same arguments that led to the non-acceptance in the first instance will be proposed again. Although the company hopes for a similar outcome, the risk of a partial acceptance and therefore a sentence, at least on a lump-sum basis, cannot be neglected. With Sentence no. 275/2016 dated 27th January 2016 the Council of State accepted the partial appeal of Ascopiave and consequently rejected the main appeal and the request for indemnification (Euro 1,300,000) by Setten Genesio, excluding litigation fees. Consequently Ascopiave owes nothing to said company nor will it ever owe to it in the future.

AEEGSI ­ RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 241/2013 ­ 533/2013: An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Latium, which overrules Ministerial Decree dated 5th February 2013 approving the agreement template for managing the service subsequent to the following calls, limiting to the last part of art. 21.3 where the manager "supplies the default service according to the methods defined by the Authority." This is a merely precautionary measure aiming at avoiding the risk of lack of interest in the aforesaid main judgement. Given the merely instrumental nature and Sentence no 12.06.2014, which sustained AEEGSI appeal and therefore overturned Regional Lombardy Sentence no. 3272 December 2012, Proceedings will not be carried on.

With appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy Milan (filed before the above-mentioned Judgement of the Italian Council of State), Resolution 241/2013 was contested as well. The main reasons are: failure to envisage a compensation for the default service interventions in progress; the provisions concerning delay penalties or failure to implement power failure to be paid by the distributor even if the delay or the failure to implement depend on causes not attributable to the distributor. Finally, in connection with previous appeals, the "motivation" given to the provision was contested: according to the AEEGSI, this motivation only derives from the need to obviate a sort of "incompetence" of the distributors. AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, with Resolutions 533/2013 and 84/2014. On 21st January 2014 an appeal was filed against Resolution 533/2013 before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy Milan. The reasons are similar to those that led to appeal Resolution 241/2013. In early-March 2015, it was disclosed that, with judgements no. 593 and 594/2015, the Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals of 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. and Italgas against the same resolutions 241/2013 and 533/2013. We are therefore awaiting the opinions of the Lawyers as concerns the convenience of continuing the legal actions considered that the interest in the judgement has somewhat diminished because the regulatory environment has been profoundly changed by the subsequent numerous legislative measures and there is therefore a need to evaluate other judgements with respect to the proceeding brought by other companies in the sector.

AEEGSI ­ RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 28/12 ­ 193/12 ­ 246/12 ­ 631/2013: An appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan, against the Authority for Electricity and Gas for cancelling Resolution ARG/gas 28/12, relating to the change from traditional meters to electronic meters, remotely read and managed; in particular: for the failure to recognize the residual value of the replaced meters still having a valid

seal; for the wrong (underestimated) indication/recognition of standard costs for the new appliances; for the obligation to use electronic meters only as from 1st March 2012 in spite of the fact that the technology needed is not yet available at an industrial level. Subsequently, as partial modifications to Resolution 28, the AEEGSI issued Resolutions 193/2012 and 246/2012, which, however, were not sufficient to withdraw the company's complaint. The deadline set on 1st March 2012 was cancelled and postponed to 31st December 2012. The company has filed an appeal against both resolutions with additional grounds. Similarly, Resolution 316/2012 through which the AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, has also been contested. With Resolution 631/2013 the AEEGSI further intervened on the matter, amending Resolution 28/2012. Therefore, the new stay request, submitted with reference to the previous rules, (also contested) was withdrawn. The proceedings are formally still in progress; however, by virtue of Resolution 631, they should/could be considered without further legal interest.

GUIDELINES ­ MINISTERIAL DECREE 22ND MAY 2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Latium ­ Rome against the Minister of Economic Development for the cancellation of Ministerial Decree dated 22nd May 2014 concerning the introduction of Guidelines for the determination of the residual industrial value. As part of the same proceedings, the issues of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling as concerns Law 9 and 116 of 2014, in the section which has modified art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (retrospective deduction of private contributions and time limit of agreements' validity) were raised. The Regional Administrative Court, with reference to the appeals filed by other Distributors including an application for suspension, has scheduled the hearing on 27th June 2015. Ascopiave S.p.A.'s lawyers will request that the proceedings are discussed during the same hearing, or another one to be scheduled. The Court has ordered the postponement of the discussion to another Hearing to be scheduled approximately in October-December, also considering the forthcoming entry into force (29th July 2015) of Ministerial Decree no. 106 dated 20th May 2015, amending Decree 226/2011. This, at least as far as art. 5 is concerned, essentially introduces the regulation of the Guidelines into Ministerial Decree 226/2011. As a result, on 1st October 2015, this latest Measure was also contested on additional grounds. The next hearing has been scheduled for 28th April.

AEEGSI Resolutions ARG/gas 310/2014 and ARG/gas 414/2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the AEEGSI, for the cancellation of the Resolutions ARG/gas 310 and 414/2014 related to the methods for assessing the RAB RIV delta, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (current text) when the difference is higher than 10%. To date, there are no further procedural steps

AEEGSI Resolution ARG/gas 367/2014 An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the AEEGSI, for the cancellation of Resolution ARG/gas 367/2014 related to the methods for recognizing the value of the RAB RIV delta in the section which envisages different regulations for incumbent (no reimbursement) and non-incumbent (full reimbursement) winners of the Territorial tender. With Judgement no. 2221/2015 filed on 19th October 2015, the Regional Administrative Court, confirming the previous (already reported) Judgment 1396/2015, rejected the appeal. Ascopiave

is currently assessing if an Appeal is appropriate. As far as the most impactful aspects are concerned, the Judgement has recognised the legitimacy of the asymmetric regulatory solution adopted by AEEGSI, according to which for each municipal installation, the local net invested capital (RAB), recognised to the winner of the territorial tender, will be equal to:
· The reimbursement value of the above-mentioned installation, when the new operator differs from the outgoing operator;
· The amount currently recognised by virtue of the current municipal concession, if the new operator coincides with the outgoing operator.
The asymmetric regulatory solution shall only apply for the duration of the first territorial concession. On 18th January 2016 Ascopiave appealed to this Sentence.
CATEGORY V ­CIVIL LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2015 the following are pending:
ASCOPIAVE ­ UNIT B: A civil judgment before the Court of Treviso (RG 6941/2013) following the pre-trial technical investigation, which ended with the report of the Expert witness (appointed by the Court), and started by Ascopiave S.p.A. (writ of summons dated 22nd August 2013) in order to obtain compensation for damages to the entrance floor of the "Unit B", against: Bandiera Architetti S.r.l. (Designers), Mr. Mario Bertazzon (Contract Manager) and Mr. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali S.r.l. (Contractor). The compensation request refers to an assessment of damage between approximately Euro 127 thousand (Expert witness estimate for full restoration) and Euro 208 thousand (estimate of a Third party firm for full makeover). All the Parties regularly appeared before the Court. Following the third-party notice (Insurance Company and Site engineer) the first hearing is scheduled on 17th April 2014. Upon its completion, the Judge granted the ordinary investigatory period and scheduled the next hearing on 15th July 2014. The Court, by Order dated 22nd December 2014, decided the complete renewal of the expert witness board, appointing an assessor. The appointment was confirmed in the hearing held on 13th March 2015. Ascopiave S.p.A. has appointed its own expert. The experts' investigations are currently in progress and we are awaiting the Final report of the expert witness. Meanwhile, since the "field" operations are basically completed, in order to remedy a situation of degradation and potential danger for Visitors and prior notice to the expert witness, the works to reconstruct the flooring have started.

Relations with the Agenzia delle Entrate (Inland Revenue Agency)

During 2008, the company Ascopiave S.p.A. was subject to tax audit by the Inland Revenue Office Regional Office

Following the audit, a report on findings with observations on the indirect and direct taxes was issued. During the

month of July 2008, the local Internal Revenue Office issued a notice of assessment regarding the contents of the report

on findings. The company, on 5th February 2010, filed an appeal in the Provincial Tax Commission in addition pay the sum of Euro

243 thousand following application to its pending judgment. On 30th September 2010 the Provincial Tax Commission of Treviso delivered judgment 131/03/10 filed on 14th

December 2010 upheld the action and recognizing the proper conduct tax adopted by the company.

Subsequently, the Inland Revenue Office has appealed against the first instance judgment issued by the Provincial

Commission of Treviso.
