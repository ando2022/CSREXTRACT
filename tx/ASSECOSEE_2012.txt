IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED WHEN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Basis for preparation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and assets that are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
The currency of these consolidated financial statements is zloty (PLN), and all figures are presented in thousands of zlotys (PLN '000), unless stated otherwise.
These consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going-concern basis, assuming the Group, Parent Company as well as its subsidiary companies will continue their business activities in the foreseeable future.
Till the date of approving these financial statements, we have not observed any circumstances that would threaten the Company and the Group companies' ability to continue as going concerns in the period of at least 12 months following the balance sheet date.
2. Compliance statement
These consolidated financial statements were prepared in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and IFRS adopted by the European Union. As at the date of approving publication of these financial statements, given the ongoing process of implementing the IFRS standards in the European Union as well as the Group's operations, in the scope of accounting policies applied by the Group there is no difference between the IFRS that came into force and the IFRS endorsed by the EU.
IFRS include standards and interpretations accepted by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC").
Some of the Group companies maintain their accounting books in accordance with the accounting policies (principles) set forth in their respective local regulations. The consolidated financial statements include adjustments not disclosed in the accounting books of the Group's entities, which were introduced to adjust the financial statements of those entities to the IFRS.
3. Functional currency and reporting currency
The functional currency applied by the Parent Company as well as the reporting currency used in these consolidated financial statements is the Polish zloty (PLN).
Separate and consolidated financial statements of the Group companies are drawn up in the currency of their primary business environment (in their functional currencies). The functional currencies of direct subsidiaries of ASEE S.A. include the Romanian leu (RON), Croatian kuna (HRK), Serbian dinar (RDS), Macedonian denar (MKD), euro (EUR), Turkish lira (TRY), Bulgarian lev (BGN), and Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark (BAM).
4. Changes in estimates and presentation methods
In the period of 12 months ended 31 December 2012, the Company's approach to making estimates was not subject to any substantial changes.
5. Professional judgement
Preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires making estimates and assumptions which impact the data disclosed in such financial statements. Despite the estimates and assumptions have been adopted based on the Group's management best knowledge on the current activities and occurrences, the actual results may differ from those anticipated.

All figures in thousands of PLN, unless stated otherwise

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Below are presented the main areas, which in the process of applying the accounting policies were subject to accounting estimates and the management's professional judgement, and whose estimates, if changed, could significantly affect the Group's future results.
i. Operating cash flows assumed for valuation of IT contracts as well as measurement of their completion
The Group executes a number of contracts for construction and implementation of information technology systems. Valuation of IT contracts requires determination of future operating cash flows in order to provide the fair value of revenues and expenses, as well as measurement of the progress of contract execution. The percentage of contract completion shall be measured as the relation of costs already incurred (provided such costs contribute to the progress of work) to the total costs planned, or as a portion of man-days worked out of the total work-effort required. As at 31 December 2012, receivables arising from valuation of IT contracts amounted to PLN 12,480 thousand, while liabilities due to such valuation equalled PLN 2,966 thousand.
ii. Rates of depreciation and amortization
The level of depreciation and amortization rates is determined on the basis of anticipated period of useful economic life of the components of tangible and intangible assets. The Group verifies the adopted periods of useful life on an annual basis, taking into account the current estimates.
iii. Goodwill ­ impairment test
As at 31 December 2012, the Management Board of the Parent Company performed an impairment test on goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary companies. This task required making estimates of the recoverable value of goodwill allocated to individual operating segments. The recoverable value is estimated by determination of the future cash flows expected to be achieved from the cash-generating unit and determination of a discount rate to be subsequently used in order to calculate the net present value of those cash flows. As at 31 December 2012, goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary companies amounted to PLN 487,111 thousand as compared with PLN 523,149 thousand reported as at 31 December 2011.
iv. Liabilities to pay for the remaining stakes of shares in subsidiary companies
Both as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group recognized liabilities by virtue of future payments to non-controlling shareholders in the company Multicard, Serbia. As at 31 December 2012, such liabilities equalled PLN 628 thousand, while as at 31 December 2011 they were PLN 1,266 thousand. Determination of the amounts payable under such liabilities required making estimates of the company's future financial results.
v. Deferred income tax assets
As at 31 December 2012, the Group recognized a deferred income tax asset in the amount of PLN 3,901 thousand and a deferred income tax provision of PLN 2,527 thousand. In the period of 12 months ended 31 December 2012, the balance of deferred income tax asset and provision changed by PLN 2,003 thousand, as compared with PLN -583 thousand in the corresponding period of 2011.
Based on the current financial budget and applicable tax regulations, the Group's management believes that future utilization of deferred tax asset recognized on the consolidated financial statements in the amount of PLN 3,901 thousand is very likely.
The Parent Company did not recognize the entire balance of deferred income tax asset related to the prior years' losses. Deferred income tax assets arising from tax losses were recognized in the amount of PLN 2,300 thousand, this is to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will enable writing such unutilized losses off. As at 31 December

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
2012, the Parent Company's tax-deductible losses not accounted for in deferred income tax assets amounted to PLN 73,181 thousand.

8. Major accounting policies:
i. Consolidation rules
These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company, Asseco South Eastern Europe S.A., as well as the financial data of its subsidiaries in each case prepared for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012. The financial data of subsidiary companies have been prepared using consistent accounting policies and based on uniform accounting policies applied to transactions and business events of similar nature.
Subsidiary companies are entities in which the Group holds more than half of the votes at the general meeting of shareholders or is able to direct the financial and operating policy of such entities in any other way. Assessment whether the Group controls other entities is made considering the existence and influence of potential votes, which may be exercised at the general meeting of shareholders of such entities.
All balances of settlements and transactions between the Group companies, including unrealized profits resulting from transactions within the Group, are fully eliminated during the consolidation. Losses are eliminated to the extent in which they do not indicate impairment.
Subsidiary companies are subject to consolidation in the period from the date the Group obtains control over such entities until such control ceases. The parent company maintains control over an entity when it holds, either directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, more than half of the votes in such entity unless it can be proved that such ownership does not result in the exercise of control. Control is maintained also when the Company is able to direct the financial and operating policy of a given entity. Any changes in the parent company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as capital transactions. In such events, in order to reflect changes in the ownership of a respective subsidiary, the Group shall adjust the balance sheet value of controlling interests and non-controlling interests. Any differences between the change in non-controlling interests and the fair value of consideration paid or received are recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent company.

The Group's interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the

proportionate consolidation method. All the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a

jointly controlled entity attributable to the Group are combined line by line with similar

items

in

the

Group's

consolidated

financial

statements.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group must be subject to appropriate

consolidation adjustments in order to eliminate the Group's share in mutual balances,

income, expenses and unrealized profits resulting from transactions between the Group

subsidiaries

and

a

jointly

controlled

entity.

A jointly controlled entity is recognized under the proportionate method until the time the

joint control over such entity ceases. From the date on which an entity ceases to be jointly

controlled and it does not become a subsidiary or an associate of the Group, the Group

shall account for its interest in such entity at fair value. Any differences between the

carrying value of a former joint venture and the fair value of the present investment and

also any proceeds from disposal shall be recognized in the income statement. In the event

the remaining portion of investment is significant, it shall be accounted for as an

investment in an associate.

ii. Combination of businesses under common control
A business combination involving business entities under common control is a business combination whereby all of the combining business entities are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties, both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory.
This refers in particular to transactions such as a transfer of companies or ventures between individual companies within a capital group, or a merger of a parent company with its subsidiary.
The effects of combination of businesses under common control are accounted for by the Group as a uniting of interests.
In the event of a business combination in which an investment in one subsidiary is contributed to another subsidiary or in which two subsidiaries of Asseco South Eastern Europe S.A. are combined, the carrying value of investment in the acquiree subsidiary is only transferred to the value of investment in the acquirer subsidiary. Hence, a take-over of one subsidiary by another subsidiary has no impact on the financial results of the Company or the Group.
iii. Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of an entity is initially recognized at purchase cost constituting the excess of:
· the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquired entity.
· over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
After initial recognition, goodwill is reported at the purchase cost less any accumulated impairment charges. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications to do so. Goodwill is not subject to amortization. As at the acquisition date, the acquired goodwill is allocated to every cash-generating unit which may benefit from synergy effects of the related business combination. Each cashgenerating unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall:
· represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
· not be larger than an operating segment identified in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
An impairment write-down is determined by estimating the recoverable value of a cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated. In the event the recoverable value of a cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge shall be recognized. In the event a cash-generating unit contains goodwill and a part of business of this cash-generating unit is sold, goodwill related to the disposed business shall be included in its balance sheet value for the purpose of determining a gain or loss on disposal of that business. In such circumstances the value of goodwill sold shall be measured as a proportion of the value of business disposed to the value of the cashgenerating unit retained.
iv. Restatement of items expressed in foreign currencies
The currency of measurement applied by the Parent Company as well as the reporting currency used in these consolidated financial statements is the Polish zloty (PLN).
Separate and consolidated financial statements of the Group companies are drawn up in the currency of their primary business environment (in their functional currencies). The functional currencies of direct subsidiaries of Asseco South Eastern Europe S.A. include the

All figures in thousands of PLN, unless stated otherwise

23

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Romanian leu (RON), Croatian kuna (HRK), Serbian dinar (RDS), euro (EUR), Turkish lira (TRY), Bulgarian lev (BGN), and Bosnia and Herzegovina mark (BAM).
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are first recognized at the functional currency exchange rate of the transaction date. Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are restated at the functional currency exchange rate of the balance sheet date. Foreign currency non-cash items valued at historical cost are restated at the exchange rate as at the initial transaction date. Foreign currency non-cash items valued at fair value are restated using the exchange rate as of the date when such fair value is determined.
As at the balance sheet date, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than Polish zloty are translated to Polish zlotys at the mid exchange rates of such currencies as published by the National Bank of Poland and in effect on the last day of the reporting period. Foreign currency differences resulting from such translation are reported respectively as financial income (expenses) or in shareholders' equity.
As at the balance sheet date, assets and liabilities of those foreign subsidiary companies have been restated in the reporting currency of Asseco South Eastern Europe Group using the exchange rate effective on the balance sheet date, and their income statements have been restated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Foreign currency differences resulting from such restatement are reported directly under own equity, as a separate component thereof. On the date of disposal of a foreign company, the accumulated deferred exchange rate differences carried under own equity and relating to that foreign company shall be recognized in the income statement.
The following exchange rates were applied for the purpose of balance sheet valuation:

v. Put options for non-controlling shareholders
During a year non-controlling interests are recognized in equity along with any changes in their value resulting from allocation of a portion of net profit attributable to minority shareholders, from their share in changes of other equity items as well as from any dividends declared until the balance sheet date. At each balance sheet date, noncontrolling interests are temporarily reversed, as if such minority interests being subject to put options were redeemed on that date.
The resulting financial liabilities are recognized at fair value at each balance sheet date; whereas, the difference between the values of a reversed non-controlling interest and the corresponding financial liability is disclosed in equity as at each balance sheet date.
Any exercise of put option rights is accounted for as described above; whereas, the financial liability is extinguished through an actual payment of the option exercise price.
If an option expires unexercised, any adjustments to equity made in the past at each balance sheet date shall be reversed, and the non-controlling interest shall be recognized in the amount at which it would be carried if the option was not accounted for by the Company.
The above described policy addresses the accounting treatment of currently held put option.
vi. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are disclosed at the purchase cost/production cost decreased by accumulated depreciation and any impairment write-downs. The initial value of tangible assets corresponds to their purchase cost increased by expenses related directly to the purchase and adaptation of such assets to their intended use. Such expenses may also include the cost of spare parts to be replaced on machinery or equipment at the time when incurred, when the criteria for such recognition are met. Any costs incurred after a tangible asset is commissioned to use, such as maintenance or repair fees, are expensed in the income statement at the time when incurred.
At the time of purchase tangible assets are divided into components of significant value for which separate periods of useful life may be adopted. General overhaul expenses constitute a component of assets as well.
Such assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives which are as follows:

Type

Period of useful life

Buildings and structures Leasehold improvements Computers and telecommunication equipment Furniture Air conditioners Transportation vehicles Other tangible assets

40 years 5 years 1-5 years 2-8 years 5-10 years 4-6 years 2-5 years

The residual values, useful lives as well as the methods of depreciation of tangible assets are verified on an annual basis and, if necessary, corrected with effect as of the beginning of the financial year just ended.
Should there be any events or changes indicating that the book value of property, plant and equipment may not be recovered, such assets will be reviewed for their possible impairment. If there are any indications of a possible impairment and the book value exceeds the expected recoverable value, the value of such assets or cash-generating units shall be reduced to the recoverable amount. The recoverable value of property, plant and

All figures in thousands of PLN, unless stated otherwise

25

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
equipment is the greater of their fair value (decreased by any related selling expenses) and their value in use. In order to determine the value in use, estimated future cash flows shall be discounted to the present value by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the value of money in time and the risks related to the asset. In case of an asset which does not generate cash independently, the recoverable value shall be determined for the cash-generating unit, to which such asset belongs. Impairment write-downs are accounted for as operating expenses in the income statement.
A tangible asset may be derecognized from the balance sheet after it is disposed or when no economic benefits are expected from its further use. Gain/loss on disposal of a tangible fixed asset shall be assessed by comparing the proceeds from such disposal against the present book value of such asset, and it shall be accounted for as an operating income/expense. Any gains or losses resulting from derecognition of an asset from the balance sheet (measured as the difference between net proceeds from disposal of such asset and its carrying amount) are recognized in the income statement for the period when such derecognition is made.
Investments in progress relate to tangible assets under construction or during assembly and are recognized at purchase cost or production cost, decreased by any eventual impairment write-downs. Tangible assets under construction are not depreciated until their construction is completed and they are commissioned to use.
vii. Investment property
Investment property is initially recognized at the purchase cost or production cost.
Subsequently to such initial recognition, an investment property owned by the Group is accounted for in accordance with the requirements applicable to tangible fixed assets, this is at purchase cost or production cost decreased by accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment write-downs, except for the investment property that meets the criteria to be qualified as held for sale or is disclosed in the group of assets classified as held for sale.
An investment property shall be removed from the balance sheet after it is disposed or definitely withdrawn from use, when no future economic benefits are expected from its sale. Any gain or loss resulting from removal of an investment property from the balance sheet shall be disclosed in the income statement for the period in which such derecognition is made.
Such assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives.
viii. Intangible assets
Purchased separately or as a result of merger of companies
Intangible assets purchased in a separate transaction shall be capitalized at purchase cost. Intangible assets acquired as a result of a company take-over shall be capitalized at fair value as at the take-over date.
The period of useful life of an intangible asset shall be assessed and classified as definite or indefinite. Intangible assets with a definite period of useful life are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life, and amortization charges are expensed adequately in the income statement. The periods of useful life, being the basis for determination of amortization rates, are subject to annual verification and, if needed, they are adjusted starting from the next financial year.
Except for development work, intangible assets produced by the Group on its own shall not be capitalized, but expenditures on their production shall be expensed in the income statement for the period in which they were incurred.

All figures in thousands of PLN, unless stated otherwise

26

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Impairment tests shall be performed every year for intangible assets with an indefinite period of useful life and those which are no longer used. The remaining intangible assets shall be tested for impairment if there are indications of a possible impairment in value. Should the book value exceed the estimated recoverable value (the higher of the following two amounts: net sales price or value in use), the value of these assets shall be reduced to the recoverable value.
Cost of development work
An intangible asset generated as a result of development work (or completion of the development phase of an internal project) should be recognized if, and only if, the Group is able to demonstrate:
· the technical ability to finish the construction of such intangible asset so that it would be suitable for use or sale;
· the intention of finishing the construction of such intangible asset and the intention to use or sell the item;
· the ability to use or sell such intangible asset; · how such intangible asset is going to generate probable future economic benefits. First
of all the company should demonstrate there is a market for products made with the use of the given intangible asset, or that such intangible asset may itself be sold, or that such intangible asset is useful if it is to be used by the company; · the availability of relevant technical, financial and other resources required to finish the development work and to make the intangible asset ready for use or sale; · its ability to measure reliably the expenditure for the development work attributable to such intangible asset.
Costs of development work which do not satisfy the above criteria shall be expensed in the income statement.
Costs of development work which satisfy the above-mentioned criteria are recognized at purchase cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment write-downs. All the expenditures carried forward to future periods are subject to amortization over the estimated period in which the related undertaking generates sales revenues. The costs of development work shall be amortized over the period of economic use of an intangible asset, but not longer than for 5 years.
The costs of development work are reviewed concerning a possible impairment on an annual basis ­ if the related asset has not been commissioned to use, or more frequently ­ if during the reporting period there is an indication of impairment, as a result of which the book value may not be recovered.
All the intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized under the straight-line method. Below are presented the periods of useful life adopted for intangible assets:

Any gains or losses resulting from derecognition of an intangible asset from the balance sheet (measured as the difference between net proceeds from disposal of such asset and its carrying amount) are recognized as other income or other expenses in the income statement at the time when such derecognition is made.
ix. Leases
Finance lease agreements, under which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are transferred to the Company, are recognized in the balance sheet at the commencement of the lease term, at fair value of the leased tangible asset or at present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly as expenses in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment used under finance lease agreements are subject to depreciation over the estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter.
Lease agreements, whereby the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are considered as operating leases. The initial direct costs incurred during the negotiation of operating lease agreements are added to the balance sheet value of the leased asset and are subsequently recognized over the lease term, on the same basis as revenues from rental. The conditional leasing fees are recognized as income for the period when they become receivable.
x. Borrowing costs
The costs of external financing are capitalized as a part of the production cost of tangible assets, investment property, or intangible assets, as the case may be. The borrowing costs include any interest computed using the effective interest rate, financial charges under finance lease agreements, or foreign exchange differences that are incurred as a result of external financing up to the amount of interest expense adjustment.
xi. Financial instruments
Financial instruments are divided into the following categories:
· Financial assets held to maturity, · Financial instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss, · Loans granted and receivables · Financial assets available for sale, and · Financial liabilities
All the financial assets are initially recognized at the purchase cost equal to fair value of the effected payment, including the costs related to the purchase of a financial asset, except for financial instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held to maturity are investments with identified or identifiable payments and with a fixed maturity date, which the Group intends and is able to hold till maturity. Financial assets held to maturity are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. Financial assets held to maturity shall be classified as fixed assets if their maturity exceeds 12 months from the balance sheet date.

All figures in thousands of PLN, unless stated otherwise

28

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Financial instruments acquired in order to generate profits by taking advantage of shortterm price fluctuations shall be classified as financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are measured at their market value as at the balance sheet date. Changes in these financial instruments are recognized as financial income or expenses. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss shall be classified as current assets, provided the Management Board intends to dispose them within 12 months from the balance sheet date. This does not apply to currency forward contracts that need to be classified as short-term items irrespectively of their term of maturity.
Loans granted and receivables are carried at amortized cost. They are recognized as current assets unless their maturity periods are longer than 12 months from the balance sheet date. Loans granted and receivables with maturity periods longer than 12 months from the balance sheet date are recognized as fixed assets.
Any other financial assets constitute financial assets available for sale. Financial assets available for sale are carried at fair value, without deducting the transaction-related costs, taking into consideration their market value as at the balance sheet date. If financial instruments are not be quoted on an active market and it is impossible to determine their fair value reliably with alternative methods, such financial assets available for sale shall be measured at the purchase cost adjusted by impairment charges. Provided financial instruments have a market price determined in a regulated active market or it is possible to determine their fair value in other reliable way, the positive and negative differences between the fair value and the purchase cost of such assets available for sale (after deducting any deferred tax liabilities) shall be disclosed in the asset revaluation reserve. A decrease in the value of assets available for sale, resulting from their impairment, shall be disclosed as a financial expense in the income statement.
Purchases or disposals of financial assets are recognized in the accounting books at the transaction date. At the initial recognition they are valued at purchase cost, this is at fair value plus the transaction-related costs.
Financial liabilities other than financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate.
A financial instrument shall be derecognized from the balance sheet if the Group no longer controls the contractual rights arising from such financial instrument; this usually takes place when the instrument is sold or when all cash flows generated by that instrument are transferred to an independent third party.
xii. Derivative financial instruments and hedges
Derivative instruments utilized by the Group in order to hedge against the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates include primarily currency forward contracts. Such financial derivatives are measured at fair value. Derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities depending on whether their value is positive or negative.
Gains and losses on changes in fair value of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognized directly in profit or loss for the financial year.
Fair value of currency forward contracts is determined on the basis of the forward exchange rates available currently for contracts with similar maturity.
Hedge accounting includes the following types of hedges:
· fair value hedges against the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or
· cash flow hedges against the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or with a forecast transaction, or
· hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

Cash flow hedges
The Parent Company of Asseco South Eastern Europe Group has implemented hedge accounting of future cash flows so that the financial statements fully reflected the economic content of the Group's business activities as well as its acquisitions policy. The hedging instrument is cash deposited at the euro bank accounts which is intended to act as a hedge of the liabilities arising from company acquisitions.
At the inception of the hedge, the Company formally designates and documents the hedging relationship as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. That documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or with a highly probable forecast transaction, which could affect profit or loss. The portion of gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge shall be recognized directly in equity; whereas, the ineffective portion of gain or loss on the hedging instrument shall be recognized in profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains or losses that were recognized directly other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity shall be reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a non-financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, then the Company removes the associated gains and losses that were recognized directly in equity, and includes them in the purchase cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
Gains and losses on changes in fair value of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognized directly in profit or loss for the current financial reporting period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued by the Company if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. In this case, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity shall remain separately recognized in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that remains recognized directly in equity shall be recognized in profit or loss for the current financial period.

xiii. Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group determines if there are any objective indications of impairment of a financial asset or group of financial assets.
Financial assets carried at amortized cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans or receivables valued at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment write-down is measured as the difference between the asset's book value and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future bad debt losses that have not been incurred yet) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of such assets shall be reduced either directly or by establishing an impairment write-down. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in the income statement.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are assessed for impairment individually, and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized, are not included in the collective assessment of impairment of a group of assets.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss shall be reversed. Such reversal of the impairment write-down shall be recognized in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the financial asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the date when the impairment is reversed.
Financial assets carried at cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, or on a derivative instrument that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset involved and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for similar financial assets.

31

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Financial assets available for sale
When there is objective evidence that a financial asset available for sale is impaired, then the amount of difference between the purchase cost of such asset (net of any principal repayments and amortization) and its current value decreased by any impairment charges on that financial asset as previously recognized in profit or loss, shall be removed from equity and recognized in the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on equity instruments classified as available for sale cannot be recognized in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, then the amount of such impairment loss shall be reversed in the income statement.
xiv. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of the following two values: purchase cost/production cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The Group measures the cost of consumed inventories by following the first-in first-out principle or using the specific identification method.
The Group companies are obliged to perform an aging analysis of their inventories at each balance sheet date, separately for the main groups (goods for resale, maintenance service inventories). Such analysis provides the rationale for making revaluation write-downs on inventories subject to the following rules:
· 100% write-down on inventories stored longer than 2 years,
· 50% write-down on inventories stored between 1 and 2 years.
xv. Prepayments and accrued income
Prepayments comprise expenses incurred before the balance sheet date that relate to future periods.
Prepayments may in particular include the following items: · prepaid third-party services (inclusive of prepaid maintenance services) which shall be
provided in future periods, · rents paid in advance, · insurances, · any other expenses incurred in the current period, but related to future periods.
Accrued income includes mainly maintenance services relating to future periods. The Group recognizes prepayments and accrued income if their amounts relate to future reporting periods.
xvi. Trade receivables
Trade receivables, usually with payment terms ranging from 14 and 90 days, are recognized and disclosed at the amounts initially invoiced, less any allowances for uncollectible receivables. For receivables past-due over 180 days a 50% write-down shall be recognized; whereas, receivables past-due over 365 days shall be written down by 100%. An allowance for doubtful accounts shall be determined also when it is no longer probable that the entire amount receivable will be collected, irrespective of the past-due period. Doubtful accounts shall be expensed in the income statement at the time when they are deemed uncollectible.

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Where the effect of the value of money in time is material, the amount of receivables shall be measured by discounting the expected future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the value of money in time. Should the discounting method be used, any increase in receivables over time shall be booked as financial income.
xvii. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
Cash and cash equivalents presented in the balance sheet consist of cash kept in banks and on hand by the Company, short-term cash deposits with a maturity not exceeding 3 months, and other highly liquid instruments.
The balance of cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows consists of the above-defined cash and cash equivalents. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Group decided not to present bank overdraft facilities (used as an element of financing) and restricted cash in the balance of cash and cash equivalents.
xviii. Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings
All bank loans and borrowings are initially recognized at purchase cost, being the fair value of cash received net of any costs associated with obtaining the loan.
Subsequently to such initial recognition, bank loans and borrowings are measured at amortized purchase cost using the effective interest rate method. Determination of the amortized purchase cost shall take into account any costs associated with obtaining a loan.
The difference between the cash obtained (deducted by costs relating to obtaining the credit or loan) and the repayment amount shall be presented in the income statement during the period of loan. Any gains or losses shall be recognized in the income statement after the liability has been removed from the balance sheet. All expenses relating to bank loans and borrowings are recognized in the income statement for the period they relate to.
xix. Trade payables
Trade payables relating to operating activities are recognized and disclosed at the amounts due for payment, and are recognized in the reporting periods which they relate to. Other liabilities to a significant extent also relate to operating activities yet, in contrast to trade payables, they were not invoiced.
Where the effect of the value of money in time is material, the amount of payables shall be measured by discounting the expected future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the value of money in time. Where discounting method is used, the increase in liabilities due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense.
xx. Provisions
A provision should be recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects that the expenditure required to settle a provision is to be reimbursed, e.g. under an insurance contract, this reimbursement should be recognized as a separate asset when, and only when, it is virtually certain that such reimbursement will be received. The expense relating to such provision shall be disclosed in the income statement, net of the amount of any reimbursements.

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
The Group recognizes provisions for onerous contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Where the effect of the value of money in time is material, the amount of a provision shall be determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the value of money in time and the risks related to the liability. Where discounting method is used, the increase in a provision due to the passage of time is recognized as borrowing costs.
Provision for warranty repairs
The provision for warranty repairs is established to cover anticipated future costs of warranty or service obligations resulting from the executed IT contracts. The costs of fulfilment of our warranty obligations comprise mainly labour costs (number of man-days multiplied by the standard rate) as well as the value of goods, materials and third-party services used in performing such warranty obligations. This provision is set aside in the cases where: · the client has not signed any contract for maintenance services; · the scope of the maintenance services contract does not fully cover all anticipated costs
of the fulfilment of warranty obligations; · the scope of the manufacturer's warranty for any equipment resold is narrower than
the scope of warranty the Group is contractually committed to provide to its client.
The provision amount recognized at the balance sheet date shall be proportional to the progress of the IT contract execution. In particular in the case of implementation contracts, where revenues are recognized based on the percentage of contract completion, the provision amount shall be determined by multiplying such percentage of completion by the amount of costs that individual companies of the Group expect to incur in performing the warranty obligations. Hence, the cost of provision for warranty repairs is recognized proportionally to the progress of contract execution, yet it is not included in the project cost budget and, therefore, does not affect the percentage of contract completion, as it is accounted for in parallel with the project budget.
Any costs associated with the provision of our warranty services shall be, when incurred, deducted from the established provision (utilization of the provision). At each balance sheet date, the Group verifies the amount of carried provision for warranty repairs. If the actual costs of warranty services or anticipated future costs are lower/higher than assumed when the provision was established, the provision shall be decreased/increased accordingly to reflect the Group's current expectations in respect of fulfilment of its warranty obligations in future periods.
Retirement benefits, other post-employment benefits and provision for unused annual leaves
The Group establishes a provision for the present value of liabilities relating to future payments of retirement benefits. Furthermore, the Group recognizes a provision for unused annual leaves, which relate to periods prior to the balance sheet date and which will be used in future periods. Here the amount of related payment depends on the average monthly remuneration and the number of due but untaken leave days as at the balance sheet date. Costs of both termination benefits and untaken leaves are based on estimates and recognized in accordance with the accrual accounting.

xxi. Revenues
Revenues and costs related to the execution of implementation contracts
Sales of services executed under a contract, which as at the balance sheet date are not completed but provided to a considerable extent, shall be recognized at the balance sheet date proportionally to the percentage of completion of such services, on condition the amount of revenue can be determined in a reliable way. The progress of contract execution shall be measured as a percentage of the total estimated contract execution costs incurred from the date of contract conclusion till the day when the related revenues are being determined, or as a portion of work completed out of the total work effort required. When determining the contract execution costs incurred till the balance sheet date, any expenses for future activities related to the contract shall not be taken into account.
Should it be impossible to estimate reliably the result of the contract, the revenues shall only be recognized in the amount of costs incurred which the Group expects to recover.
Should it be impossible to reliably estimate the progress of a service execution as at the balance sheet date, sales revenues shall be recognized in the amount of costs incurred in the reporting period, which should however be limited to the amount of costs that are likely to be paid by the ordering party in the future.
In case it is probable that the total contract execution costs exceed the total contract revenues, the anticipated loss shall be recognized as cost in the reporting period in which it has been detected.
Production costs of unfinished services shall comprise the costs incurred since the effective date of relevant agreement till the balance sheet date. Production costs that have been incurred prior to concluding the agreement and are related to the subject matter thereof shall be capitalized, provided they are likely to be covered with future revenues received from the ordering party.
Should the percentage progress of incurred costs, decreased by expected losses and increased by profits included in the income statement, exceed the percentage progress of invoiced sales, the amount of uninvoiced sales resulting from such difference shall be disclosed as other receivables in the balance sheet.
On the other hand, if the progress of invoiced sales exceeds the proportion of costs incurred, decreased by expected losses and increased by profits included in the income statement, then future-related (unearned) revenues resulting from such difference shall be disclosed as other liabilities.
Revenues
Accounting policies relating to the recognition of sales revenues from execution of IT contracts have been already described above in this supplementary information. Revenues shall be recognized in the amount reflecting probable economic benefits associated with the transaction to be obtained by the Group and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The Group presents its revenues from the sales of licenses, services and hardware. Such presentation appropriately reflects the business profile of the Group that is engaged in the provision of comprehensive information technology solutions based on proprietary products. Those revenues are generated from the execution of information technology projects, which include development of IT systems and maintenance services.
While recognizing sales revenues the following criteria are also taken into account:
Sales revenues
Revenues shall be recognized if the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of licenses and hardware have been transferred to the buyer and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Sales of computer software licenses are recognized

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
systematically during the term of relevant contracts. Whereas, revenues from sales of implementation services are recognized based on the percentage of their completion. Revenues relating to licensing fees shall be recognized when invoiced.
Interest
Interest income shall be recognized on a time proportion basis (taking into account the effective yield, this is the interest rate which accurately discounts future cash flows during the estimated useful life of a financial instrument) on the net book value of a financial asset.
Interest income comprises interest on loans granted, investments in securities held to maturity, bank deposits and other items.
Dividends
Dividends shall be recognized when the shareholders' right to receive payment is vested.
xxii. Taxes
Current income tax
Liabilities and receivables by virtue of current income tax, for the current and prior periods, are measured at the amounts of expected payments to the tax authorities (or repayments from the tax authorities), applying the tax rates and tax regulations legally or factually in force at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
For the purpose of financial reporting, deferred income tax is calculated applying the balance sheet liability method to all temporary differences that exist, at the balance sheet date, between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount disclosed in the balance sheet. Deferred income tax provisions are established in relation to all positive temporary differences ­ except for situations when a deferred tax provision arises from initial recognition of goodwill or initial recognition of an asset or liability on a transaction other than combination of businesses, which at the time of its conclusion has no influence on pre-tax profit, taxable income or tax loss, as well as in relation to positive temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiary or associated companies or from interests in joint ventures ­ except for situations when the investor is able to control the timing of reversal of such temporary differences and when it is probable that such temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized in relation to all negative temporary differences, as well as unutilized tax losses carried forward to subsequent years, in such amount that it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow the abovementioned temporary differences, assets or losses to be utilized ­ except for situations when deferred tax assets arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability on a transaction other than combination of businesses, which at the time of its conclusion has no influence on pre-tax profit, taxable income or tax loss; as well as in relation to negative temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiary or associated companies or from interests in joint ventures, in which cases deferred tax assets are recognized in the balance sheet in such amount only that it is probable that the above-mentioned temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that sufficient taxable income will be available to offset such negative temporary differences.
The book value of an individual deferred tax asset shall be verified at every balance sheet date and shall be adequately decreased or increased in order to reflect any changes in the estimates of achieving taxable profit sufficient to utilize such deferred tax asset partially or entirely.

36

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax provisions shall be valued using the future tax rates anticipated to be applicable at the time when a deferred tax asset is realized or a deferred tax provision is reversed, the basis for which shall be the tax rates (and tax regulations) legally or factually in force at the balance sheet date.
Value added tax
Revenues, expenses and assets shall be disclosed in the amounts excluding value added tax unless:
· value added tax paid at the purchase of goods or services is not recoverable from tax authorities; in such event the value added tax paid shall be recognized as a part of the purchase cost of an asset or as an expense, and
· receivables and liabilities are presented including value added tax.
Net amount of value added tax which is recoverable from or payable to tax authorities shall be included in the balance sheet as a part of receivables or liabilities.
9. Seasonal nature of business
The Group's activities are subject to seasonality in terms of uneven distribution of turnover in individual quarters of the year. Because bulk of sales revenues are generated from the IT services contracts executed for large companies and public institutions, the fourth quarter turnovers tend to be higher than in the remaining periods. Such phenomenon occurs for the reason that the above-mentioned entities close their annual budgets for implementation of IT projects and carry out investment purchases of hardware and licenses usually in the last quarter.
10. Corrections of material errors
In the period reported, no events occurred that would require making corrections of any misstatements.

Reversals of other provisions included primarily the reversal of a provision amounting to PLN 1,208 thousand that was established by ASEE S.A. in previous years in order to account for a potential tax liability as it was questionable, whether the costs of the public offering of shares (IPO) may be recognized as tax-deductible. The court proceedings in this case were completed in 2012. During the course of legal proceedings, the Company obtained negative interpretations of the tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of such costs. Subsequently, the Company submitted an adjustment to its income tax return, whereby most of the IPO-related costs have been treated as non-tax-deductible. Due to the utilization of tax losses and additional deductions, we have not incurred any additional tax liability, while the originally established provision has not been utilized.

Financial income for the year 2012 includes a reduction of estimated conditional payments for shares in subsidiaries by the amount of PLN 494 thousand (of which EST A.. (presently a subsidiary of ASEE Turkey) ­ PLN 85 thousand, Altius, Bulgaria ­ PLN 335 thousand, and ASEE Bulgaria ­ PLN 74 thousand). Furthermore, financial income includes the effects of valuation of derivative instruments amounting to PLN 495 thousand, as well as gains on disposal of investment fund units amounting to PLN 128 thousand. In 2011, the Group recognized a financial income of PLN 3,385 thousand on a downward revision of the estimated outstanding payment for shares in EST A.., and PLN 505 thousand following a reduction of the estimated second instalment payable for shares in ASEE Bulgaria, and a financial income of PLN 701 thousand on a downward revision in the estimated liabilities to pay out dividends from undistributed profits for the years 2009 and 2010 that were recognized by the Group pursuant to the agreement for the acquisition of BDS d.o.o. (presently ASEE Croatia). The gain on valuation of non-controlling interests in ASEE Slovenia amounting to PLN 397 thousand was recognized on a fair-value measurement of the 50% stake held in that company, which was performed as part of accounting for obtaining control of that company.
Positive and negative foreign exchange differences are presented in net amounts (reflecting the surplus of positive differences over negative differences or otherwise) at the level of individual subsidiaries.

As at 31 December 2012, the Parent Company's tax-deductible losses not accounted for in deferred income tax assets amounted to PLN 73,181 thousand. The Parent Company did not recognize the entire balance of deferred income tax asset related to the prior years' losses. Deferred income tax assets arising from tax losses were recognized in the amount of PLN 2,300 thousand, this is to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will enable writing such unutilized losses off. The utilization of those tax-deductible losses is possible till the end of 2015.
Regulations applicable to the value added tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax or social security contributions are subject to frequent amendments, thereby often depriving the taxpayers of a possibility to refer to well established regulations or legal precedents. The current regulations in force include ambiguities which may give rise to different opinions and legal interpretations on the taxation regulations either between companies and public administration, or between the public administration bodies themselves. Taxation and other settlements (for instance customs duty or currency payments) may be controlled by administration bodies that are entitled to impose considerable fines, and the amounts of so determined liabilities must be paid with high interest. In effect the amounts disclosed in the financial statements may be later changed, after the taxes payable are finally determined by the taxation authorities.

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net profit for the reporting period, attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during that financial period.
Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net profit for the reporting period, attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company, by the adjusted (for the diluting impact of potential shares) weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during that financial period, adjusted by the factor of conversion of bonds convertible into ordinary shares.
Both basic and diluted earnings per share have been translated into EUR at the arithmetic average of mid exchange rates as published by the National Bank of Poland and in effect on the last day of each month (2012: EUR 1 = PLN 4.1736; 2011: EUR 1 = 4.1401).
The table below presents net profits and numbers of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Consolidated net profit for the reporting period attributable to Shareholders of ASEE S.A.

Within the Banking Solutions segment, capitalized costs of development work are primarily related to the new lines of ASEBA and Experience products ­ state-of-the-art banking software offered in the areas of distribution channels, core banking systems, and Business Intelligence solutions.
As part of the Experience product line development, in 2012 we capitalized expenditures made for the Experience solutions platform, risk management solution (Collateral Management), and banking products management solution (Product Studio).
Whereas, as part of the ASEBA product line development, we capitalized expenditures made for ASEBA Loans Back Office (loan portfolio management module), ASEBA Relationship Manager (customer relations module), ASEBA Treasury (treasury management module), ASEBA JiMBa (mobile banking platform), and ASEBA PFM (personal finance management solution).
Another important product, whose development costs were capitalized in 2012, is LeaseFlex ­ a comprehensive solution designed to support lease and asset lifecycle management at leasing companies.

The Payment Solutions segment develops the solution marketed under the NestPay® brand. It is a B2B platform handling the settlements of online card payments between headquarters and a network of dealers, which is designed to enable banks to offer card acceptance services for web merchants.

Within the Systems Integration segment, a major product, whose development costs were capitalized, is InACT ­ an innovative "all-in-one" solution intended for internal auditors and security departments. This software supports the following functionalities: monitoring and protection against transaction frauds and internal abuse, monitoring and protection against money laundering practices. A brand new product developed by this segment in 2012 is Fidelity ­ a full-fledged solution for asset lifecycle management, dedicated primarily to large organizations with dispersed organizational structure. This system automates the full lifecycle of asset and spend processes, enabling better control, increased visibility and effective management of all corporate expenditures. The last of the most important products developed during the year reported is ASEBA live ­ a software system dedicated to support the operations of a Contact Center.
In line with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group performed a measurement of the recoverable amount of the costs of development projects in progress as

Impairment tests of goodwill from consolidation
Goodwill from consolidation is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.
Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of subsidiaries was tested for impairment of value as at 31 December 2012. The value of cash-generating units (to which goodwill has been allocated) was determined on the basis of their recoverable value, by applying the model of discounted free cash flow to firm (FCFF).
The calculations were based on the following uniform assumptions: the so-called business units were analyzed which, when put together, comprise the budget and forecasts of the whole Group; detailed forecasts covered the period of 5 years, for which increasing cash flows were assumed, while for further time of each subsidiary operations the residual value was computed assuming no growth in cash flows; the assumed increases in cash flows depend upon the strategy of the entire Group, tactical plans of individual companies, they take due account of conditions prevailing in particular markets by geography and sector, and at the same time they reflect the present and potential order portfolios. The potential orders portfolio presumes gaining new clients whilst keeping the present ones. The assumed rates of growth are not materially different from average growth observed in relevant markets, forecasts for foreign subsidiaries assume growth in EUR; the discount rate applied was equivalent to the weighted average cost of capital in the market of South Eastern Europe.
Additionally, the Parent Company carried out a sensitivity analysis of the impairment tests conducted on goodwill arising from acquisition of shares in its subsidiary companies. In the sensitivity analysis different discount rates were used in order to determine their impact on the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit. As the terminal break-even points were higher than weighted average cost of capital observed in relevant segments, no impairment write-downs on goodwill arising from acquisition of shares in those companies were made in the period of 12 months ended 31 December 2012.

The provision for the costs of warranty repairs was established in connection with the obligations to provide contractually guaranteed repair services on software and hardware products supplied to our clients.
Provision for post-employment benefits
The provision for benefits after the employment period relates entirely to pension benefits which are to be paid to the Group's employees when they go into retirement.
Other provisions
As at 31 December 2011, other provisions included primarily a provision in the amount of PLN 1,229 thousand that Asseco South Eastern Europe S.A. established for a potential income tax liability in connection with the ongoing court proceedings concerning the classification of costs related to the public issuance of shares as tax deductible.
The court proceedings in this case were completed in 2012. During the course of legal proceedings, the Company obtained negative interpretations of the tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of such costs. Subsequently, the Company submitted an adjustment to its income tax return, whereby most of the IPO-related costs have been treated as non-tax-deductible. Due to the utilization of tax losses and additional deductions, we have not incurred any additional tax liability, while the originally established provision has not been reversed.

Both as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group carried a long-term liability under put options held by non-controlling shareholders in Multicard, Serbia. Such liability corresponds to the estimated present value of future payment for the remaining stake of shares in the above-mentioned company. Determination of fair value of the liability resulting from the possible exercise of stock put options was based on the following several assumptions. The Group assumes that the stock put options will be exercised by all the minority shareholders, and as a consequence the Group will acquire a 100% share in profits. The concluded stock option agreement stipulates that the future payment shall be equal to the amount of audited net profit for the calendar year preceding the option exercise year, multiplied by a contractually predefined fixed rate. Net profit assumed for measurement of the aforesaid liability has been based on the most up-to-date financial forecasts for the current year and future periods. This put option liability is lower as at 31 December 2012 than as at 31 December 2011 following a downward revision in the expected net earnings of the subsidiary, which provide basis for the calculation of the amount payable. The change in the liability's valuation was, in accordance with the Group's accounting policy, recognized in equity in the amount of PLN 422 thousand (the remaining decrease of PLN 216 thousand in the liability's amount resulted from foreign currency translation differences). The liability has been evaluated assuming the put option will be exercised in 2015.
This foreign-currency liability has been restated in Polish zlotys at the exchange rates published by the National Bank of Poland on 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, and it amounted to PLN 628 thousand and PLN 1,266 thousand, respectively.

Liabilities due to the acquisition of shares
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had no liabilities by virtue of acquisitions of shares in companies.
Liabilities due to the acquisition of shares disclosed as at 31 December 2011 included the outstanding portion of payment for shares acquired in EST A.. (presently ASEE Turkey) in the amount of PLN 85 thousand, a liability to pay PLN 763 thousand for a 49% stake in ASEE Bulgaria, as well as a liability to pay PLN 355 thousand of the second instalment for shares acquired in the Bulgarian company Altius.
Liability for the acquisition of 49% of shares in ASEE Bulgaria, amounting to PLN 763 thousand as at 31 December 2011, was subject to a final measurement in 2012. Following such final measurement, this liability was revised down and the Group recognized PLN 74 thousand in financial income for the period of 12 months ended 31 December 2012, disclosed as 'gain on revaluation of conditional payments', and PLN 57 thousand under 'foreign exchange differences'. This liability was settled in October 2012.
In 2012, the Group also recalculated its outstanding liabilities for the acquisition of shares in EST A.. (presently ASEE Turkey), amounting to PLN 85 thousand as at 31 December 2011. Following such remeasurement, this liability was reversed and recognized as the Group's financial income for 2012 (PLN 85 thousand disclosed under 'gain on revaluation of conditional payments').
Furthermore, in 2012, the Group reversed its liabilities to pay the second instalment for shares acquired in Altius, Bulgaria, which amounted to PLN 355 thousand as at 31 December 2011. Such reduction was made as the financial results generated by that acquired company were weaker than originally expected. Hence, the Group recognized a financial income of PLN 335 thousand disclosed under 'gain on revaluation of conditional payments'.

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
Within the Group's organizational structure, the company of E-Mon, Montenegro is treated as a jointly controlled company and therefore consolidated under the proportionate method. The remaining companies incorporated within the Group are treated as subsidiaries and are subject to full consolidation.
With regard to the call options embedded in the agreement for the acquisition of Multicard, Serbia under which ASEE Serbia is entitled to buy out the remaining noncontrolling interests, the company of Multicard, Serbia is treated as a subsidiary and is subject to full consolidation.
Both as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, voting interests the Group was entitled to exercise in its subsidiary companies were proportional to the Group's equity interests in these entities.
Changes in Asseco South Eastern Europe Group structure:
During the period of 12 months ended 31 December 2012, the following changes in the Group composition were observed:
Merger of the companies of ASEE Bulgaria and Altius, Bulgaria
On 10 February 2012, there was registered a merger between our two subsidiary companies seated in Bulgaria, namely ASEE Bulgaria and Altius, Bulgaria. The merger was executed by transferring all the assets of Altius, Bulgaria to ASEE Bulgaria. As a consequence of the merger, on 10 February 2012, Altius, Bulgaria was deleted from the commercial register and all of its rights and obligations were taken over by ASEE Bulgaria. This merger had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Merger between ASEE S.A. and ITD Poland
In its current report dated 1 March 2012, our Management Board informed about the Merger Plan that was agreed upon and signed between the companies of ASEE S.A. and ITD Poland on 29 February 2012. On 1 June 2012 the District Court in Rzeszów, XII Commercial Department of the National Court Register, made an entry in the register of entrepreneurs of the Company's merger with ITD Poland. The merger was conducted pursuant to article 492 § 1 item 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, this is by transferring all the assets of ITD Poland (the Acquired Company) to ASEE S.A. (the Taking-over Company). Following the merger, the company of ITD Poland has been dissolved without going into liquidation. Because ASEE S.A., acting as the Taking-over Company, held all the shares in the Acquired Company, thereby being the sole shareholder in ITD Poland, the merger was executed according to art. 515 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, this is without increasing the share capital of the Taking-over Company, as well as pursuant to art. 516 § 5-6 of the PCCC regulating the simplified business combination procedure. The merger aims at enhancing the business potential of the merging Companies and improving their ability to effectively compete in the local and European markets. It is also expected that the merger will contribute significantly to the financial stability of business operations and, in a longer run, to the creation of higher value for shareholders of our Company.
ASEE S.A. obtained control over ITD Poland on 30 July 2010 thanks to the acquisition of shares in the group of ITD A.. (presently ASEE Turkey). At that time ITD Poland was a subsidiary of ITD A.. in Turkey. On 2 November 2010, ITD A.. and ASEE S.A. signed an agreement to sell/buy shares in ITD Poland. Following this transaction, ASEE S.A. became a direct owner of 100% of shares in ITD Poland. On 9 December 2010, the District Court for the Capital City of Warsaw issued a decision on registration of a new amount of ITD Poland's share capital that reached PLN 125,651,760. This new issuance was acquired entirely by ASEE S.A. in exchange for the non-cash contribution of IPSA BHM Investments d.o.o. seated in Serbia, which held shares in the companies of ASEE Macedonia, ASEE B&H (Sarajevo), and ASEE B&H (Banja Luka). On 31 October 2011,

Asseco South Eastern Europe Group for the year ended 31 December 2012
IPSA went into liquidation and subsequently ITD Poland became a direct owner of the above-mentioned shareholdings in Macedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The merger of ASEE S.A. and ITD Poland had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of Asseco South Eastern Europe Group.
Acquisition of a 50% stake in ASEE Slovenia by ASEE S.A. from ASEE Serbia
On 18 April 2012, ASEE S.A. was registered as a holder of 100% of shares in ASEE Slovenia. So far the direct shareholding of ASEE S.A. in ASEE Slovenia was 50%; whereas, the remaining 50% of shares were owned by ASEE Serbia. Following this transaction, ASEE S.A. has become a direct owner of 100% of shares in ASEE Slovenia. This transaction was completed as part of the Group's restructuring process intended to "flatten" and simplify its organizational structure. The said transaction had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Merger of subsidiary ASEE B&H (Sarajevo) and ASEE B&H (Banja Luka)
On 19 July 2012, there was registered a merger between our two subsidiary companies seated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, namely ASEE B&H (Sarajevo) and ASEE B&H (Banja Luka). The merger was executed by transferring all the assets of ASEE B&H (Banja Luka) to ASEE B&H (Sarajevo). As a consequence of the merger, ASEE B&H (Banja Luka) was deleted from the commercial register and all of its rights and obligations were taken over by ASEE B&H (Sarajevo). This merger had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Acquisition of shares in Sigma Danimanlik ve Uygulama Merkezi A.., Istanbul
On 14 September 2012, ASEE Group acquired a 98.68% stake in the company Sigma Danimanlik ve Uygulama Merkezi A.. seated in Istanbul. The shares in Sigma were purchased for USD 9.1 million paid in cash; whereas, 86.68% of shares were acquired directly by ASEE S.A. and the remaining 12% stake was purchased by our subsidiary ASEE Turkey. The whole acquisition of Sigma was financed with own funds of ASEE Group.

35. Objectives and principles of financial risk management
Asseco South Eastern Europe Group is exposed to a number of risks arising either from the macroeconomic situation of the countries where the Group companies operate as well as from microeconomic situation in individual companies. The main external factors that may have an adverse impact on the Group's financial performance are: (i) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates versus the Polish zloty, and (ii) changes in official interest rates. The financial results are also indirectly affected by the pace of GDP growth, value of public orders for IT solutions, level of capital expenditures made by enterprises, and the inflation rate. Whereas, the internal factors with potential negative bearing on the Group's performance are: (i) risk related to the increasing cost of work, (ii) risk arising from underestimation of the project costs when entering into contracts, and (iii) risk of concluding a contract with a dishonest customer.
Foreign currency risk
The currency used for presentation of the Group's financial results is Polish zloty (PLN); whereas, the functional currencies of foreign subsidiaries of the Group are currencies of the countries where these entities are legally registered in. Consequently, the assets and financial results of such subsidiaries need to be converted to Polish zlotys and their values presented in the Group financial statements may change as they remain under the influence of foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
Changes in the market interest rates may have a negative influence on the financial results of the Group. The Group's exposure to the above-mentioned risk may result in changes of the amounts of interest charged to the Group companies on third-party borrowings which are based on variable interest rates.
Identification: The interest rate risk arises and is recognized by individual companies of the Group at the time of concluding a transaction or financial instrument based on a variable interest rate. All such agreements are subject to analysis by the appropriate departments within the Group companies, hence the knowledge of that issue is complete and acquired directly.
Measurement: The Group companies measure their exposure to the interest rate risk by preparing statements of the total amounts resulting from all the financial instruments based on a variable interest rate. Additionally, the Group companies maintain records of debt planned to be incurred during the next 12 months, and in case of long-term instruments ­ for the period of their maturity.
Objective: The purpose of reducing such risk is to minimize expenses arising from the concluded financial instruments based on a variable interest rate.
Precautions: In order to reduce their interest rate risk, the Group companies may: (i) try to avoid taking out loan facilities based on a variable interest rate or, if not possible, (ii) conclude forward interest rate hedging agreements.
Matching: The Group gathers and analyzes the current market information concerning present exposure to the interest rate risk. At present the Group companies do not apply any interest rate hedges as their third-party borrowings are short term.
Credit risk
The Group concludes transactions only with well-known companies with a good credit rating. All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to the procedures of preliminary verification of their creditworthiness. Furthermore, current monitoring of receivables makes it possible to eliminate the risk of uncollectible receivables almost entirely.

In relation to other financial assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, financial assets available for sale and some financial derivatives, the Group's credit risk results from the contracting party's inability to settle their payments, whereas the maximum exposure to such risk is limited to the book value of such financial instruments.
There is no particular concentration of credit risk in any segment of the Group's operations.
Financial liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. This solution takes into account the maturity deadlines of investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable, other financial assets) as well as the anticipated cash flows from operating activities.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity and flexibility of financing by using various sources of funds.
The following table shows the Group's trade payables as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, by maturity period based on the contractual undiscounted payments.

Effects of reducing the foreign currency risk
The analysis of sensitivity of trade payables and receivables as well as of cash at foreign currency bank accounts to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the American dollar against the functional currencies of the Group companies indicates a potential gain of PLN 24 thousand in case the dollar depreciates 10% versus such functional currencies. However, if the euro depreciates 10% versus the functional currencies of the Group companies, the Group will potentially lose PLN 439 thousand. Hence, the cumulative

effect of weaker dollar and euro against the functional currencies of the Group companies would deteriorate the Group's financial results by PLN 415 thousand. In contrast, if the dollar and euro appreciated versus those functional currencies, the Group would recognize an additional gain of PLN 415 thousand.

Effects of reducing the interest rate risk

The risk involved in changes of interest rates does not significantly affect the financial results achieved by the Group.

Methods adopted for conducting the sensitivity analysis

The analysis of sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, with potential impact on our financial results, was conducted using the percentage deviations of +/-10% by which the reference exchange rates, effective as at the balance sheet date, were increased or decreased.
