In April 2016, Ambu acquired the patent rights to its breathing circuits product line. A breathing circuit comprises the equipment that connects the patient to the anaesthesia machine and delivers oxygen to the anaesthetised patient during surgical procedures. 3

Strategic decisions and committed efforts

FY 2015/16 was a year in which Ambu climbed new heights, and in which we exceeded the strategic targets we set ourselves in 2013. Now, we have the strength needed to see us through the years to come.

In 2013, Ambu launched its `Climbing New Heights 2017' strategy. This was a strategy plan that built further on the `GPS Four' strategy plan for the 2009-2013 period. During this period, Ambu created a stronger platform for its operations comprising well-managed factories in Asia, an extensive and global sales organisation and an infrastructure characterised by optimised processes and procedures. Last, but not least, the strategy was based on our belief that single-use visualisation products are the future. We launched our videoscopes, which have since had a breakthrough at hospitals worldwide. Last year, 200,000 videoscopes were sold by Ambu.
With `Climbing New Heights 2017', Ambu was to achieve marked growth ­ in the space of a few years reaching DKK 2bn in revenue, while at the same time increasing its EBIT margin. Also, the new strategy plan was intended to turn Ambu into a leading global player within the fields of anaesthesia and patient monitoring. Ambitious objectives, which the organisation has since been committed to fulfilling.
Ahead of targets
It is therefore only natural that we should feel pleased with the fact that our financial targets have now been met, one year ahead of schedule.
In three years, we have met the financial targets set out in our four-year strategy. We have topped DKK 2bn in revenue. We have increased our EBIT margin to 17.1%. And we have realised free cash flows of DKK 285m, a working capital ratio of 25% and a declining rate of cost. At the same time, we have developed our sales regions so that almost 50% of our revenue is now generated in the world's largest market for healthcare, the USA. Almost 42% of our revenue comes from Europe, and the rest from Asia and emerging markets. A strong platform for further expansion.
Ambu is now positioned as a strong global player within the healthcare industry, realising results which makes Ambu one of the fastest-growing companies in recent years.
Ambu has delivered strong growth quarter after quarter. Growth which is significantly above average for the industry. At the same time, we have increased our profit margin by keeping costs down. We have reached a point where our revenue has topped DKK 500m per quarter, and in a lean organisation, this means that we are reaping economies of scale which are paving the way for profitable growth.
Strengthen business
The past year has obviously been a busy one, in which Ambu has undertaken large-scale projects involving both our global supply chain and our sales function. We have

launched several new and exciting products. A videoscope for urology in partnership with Coloplast, a new aScope as well as a number of products within our core areas.
We have acquired the patents related to an important product line, namely breathing circuits. This acquisition cements our position within the breathing circuits segment, which we first started targeting following the acquisition of King Systems in 2013. Our appetite for acquisitions which create value continues, most recently with the acquisition of ETView Medical. The acquisition complements our product portfolio, and adds a number of exciting single-use products that will strengthen Ambu's position as a supplier of state-of-the-art visualisation equipment to hospitals.
These are important initiatives which strengthen Ambu's business, and which contribute to Ambu's further development. They are initiatives which are whetting Ambu's appetite for more, and which are helping us every day to develop our relations with hospitals and rescue services all over the world.

Global investments
So what is the next step now that our financial targets have been met? We are setting new goals for 2016/17 of course, and we are making sure to implement the last of the activities which are part of our Climbing New Heights strategy, before presenting our ambitious new 2020 plan in about a year's time. We are aiming higher because we believe that we can do even better. That we can become an even more relevant partner for doctors, nurses and paramedics all over the world. We believe that the introduction of advanced medical equipment for singleuse is only in its infancy.

In the period leading up to 2020, we will invest further in growth through more efficient distribution channels in both existing and new markets. We will continue to establish value-adding partnerships, and we will intensify our efforts to develop new and efficient solutions for the healthcare sector which can pave the way for continued growth in the years to come. Last, but not least, we will continue to identify companies which ­ under Ambu's ownership ­ can create further momentum.

We are in a stronger position than ever before in Ambu's 79-year history, and we are looking forward to continuing our exciting journey ­ one which is adding value for our customers, employees and shareholders.

Strategy and financial targets
Ambu's BlueSensorTM electrodes are known for providing a clear signal and for being gentle on the skin. They are used, for example, by cardiologists to perform ECG measurements (measuring heart rhythm). 8

Industry
As a global medtech company, Ambu is part of the healthcare industry. The industry is undergoing major changes due to technological developments which are increasingly paving the way for new types of solutions within established treatment areas.
Health-economic focus Global health budgets have come under increasing pressure in recent years, which has led to pressure on prices in most product categories, but also to a markedly increased focus on optimising existing courses of treatment. Performance and penalty schemes in many countries are increasingly pressurising hospitals into thinking along new lines and into increasing the costeffectiveness of their treatments and the products they use.
At the same time, population growth and increasing life expectancies are fuelling an increased demand for treating lifestyle diseases, for surgical procedures and for cosmetic treatments.
Economic and demographic developments mean that Ambu ­ as well as our competitors ­ are experiencing an increased pressure on prices as well as a need to document the efficacy of our products. Ambu has, in recent years, been able to mitigate the pressure on prices, and we are seeing an average drop in our prices of approx. 0.5-1% a year. Ambu is devoting more and more resources to health economics, i.e. to documenting the beneficial effect of our products on patient care and hospital economy.
Statutory requirements Thus, market conditions are becoming tougher, and the competition for market share is intense. At the same

time, stricter standards are being imposed on suppliers by the authorities. The local registration of new products remains a challenge, often taking years. In addition, the US health authorities have intensified their focus on companies and their infrastructure.
Hygiene Following a number of incidents in the USA, the US Food and Drug Administration has warned of a number of hygiene-related challenges due to the inadequate cleaning of videoscopes. This has directed particular attention to the risk of infection and cross-contamination associated with reusable videoscopes.
It is a trend that supports Ambu's position as a leading supplier of single-use products which eliminate the risk of contamination and infection. In addition, the use of single-use scopes also contributes to improving hospital procedures and processes, and thus the relevance of the Ambu aScope.
Market opportunities Ambu focuses on developing and selling single-use products which optimise working procedures, reduce costs and enhance patient care.
Thanks to our experience and size, we are strongly positioned in relation to our competitors and in terms of meeting customer needs and regulatory requirements. At the same time, Ambu is playing a vital role in operating rooms, as most of our products help doctors maintain patients' airways during surgical procedures. From this favourable position, Ambu therefore has considerable scope for realising further growth.

9

Business model
Ambu develops, manufactures and sells equipment for hospitals and rescue services all over the world. We develop our products in close cooperation with doctors, nurses and paramedics to ensure that our solutions are of the greatest possible relevance to the working lives of users ­ in operating rooms and when called out to accidents.
Global development Ambu's product development is global. Our innovation centre is located in Denmark, where we focus on developing completely new products, but we also have local development departments at each of our factories ­ in China, Malaysia and the USA. The local development departments are primarily engaged in updating and improving existing products and production methods.

Our own factories We own and operate our factories, which produce most of the products we sell. Moreover, we have been working with a number of subsuppliers for many years.
Specialised sales force Most of our revenue is generated through our own direct sales. Ambu has sales representatives in 19 countries, and over the past few years, our sales force has become specialised within our various business areas. Also, we have taken on a number of so-called clinical consultants to help customers use our visualisation products as expediently as possible.

Strategy
Ambu's current strategy period ends at the end of FY 2016/17, but even now ­ one year ahead of schedule ­ we have already delivered on the overarching financial targets defined back in 2013. The targets for 2016/17 were:
· Revenue of DKK 2bn, measured at fixed exchange
rates, corresponding to average organic growth of 8-9% since 2013
· An EBIT margin in the range of 17-18%, having
achieved an EBIT margin of 17.1% in FY 2015/16
· Working capital ratio of 25%, which was achieved by
the end of September 2016
Our strategy, Climbing New Heights, will continue in 2016/17 as planned, after which it is completed. The new strategy process will commence in spring 2017 with a view to being launched in October 2017. The framework for the new strategy for the period up until 2020 will be based on four objectives:
High organic growth rate Since 2013, Ambu has averaged organic growth of 89%. During the period up until 2020, we aim for Ambu to, as a minimum, continue to realise high single-digit organic growth rates. The growth will be generated partly through the continued expansion of the market for singleuse videoscopes, and partly by Ambu's core products.
Continued increase in EBIT margin Ambu has developed a scalable business model based on innovation, growth driven by high-margin single-use products and the competences required to constantly reduce costs. As a result, since 2012/13 we have been able to increase our EBIT margin by more than 5 percentage points. By maintaining this focus, in the period leading up to 2020, it is our ambition to at least achieve an increase in Ambu's EBIT margin similar to the increase realised since 2013.
Innovation Ambu will intensify its focus on innovation with a view to developing and launching more new, value-adding products for hospitals. In the period leading up to 2020, Ambu's development activities will result in new products and new applications, which will strengthen Ambu's position as a leading global supplier of high-quality products that bring economic benefits for hospitals and improve patient safety.
Growth through acquisitions and partnerships In recent years, we have carried out a number of acquisitions of enterprises as well as technologies. Going forward, we see a number of opportunities for selective acquisitions of technologies and the formation of partnerships that will strengthen our commercial and technological position through being integrated with Ambu.

Outlook 2016/17

In 2016/17, Ambu expects to realise growth in revenue markedly in excess of market growth. We expect to see solid growth in both business areas Anaesthesia and PMD, driven by our visualisation products as well as our core products.

Market conditions The general market growth in both Europe and North America is expected to remain at a low level of approx. 1-3%. The economic situation is challenging, and the general competitive situation is not expected to change materially.

In the USA, Ambu has in recent years positioned itself as a leading supplier of single-use products for hospitals and also as a strong partner with the large general purchasing organisations (GPOs). There are positive signs that this strategy will continue to create growth opportunities for Ambu.

The European economies are still characterised by low economic growth, and there are no signs that this will change any time soon. Based on Ambu's innovative product portfolio, we also expect both business areas to be able to generate growth in Europe substantially above the market growth in FY 2016/17.

In the rest of the world, Ambu has realised double-digit growth rates in recent years, and the contribution margin from these regions is becoming increasingly important for Ambu's total growth. This development is expected to continue in 2016/17.

In 2016/17, the pressure on prices is expected to be similar to previous years, i.e. in the range of 0.5-1%. The pressure on prices will affect a broad range of product lines and markets, but nevertheless the overall gross margin is still expected to increase as growth is driven by products with above-average margins.

The acquisition of ETView Medical Ltd. was finalised on 28 September 2016, and the company is therefore fully consolidated in 2016/17. Due to the company's very limited activities so far, its contribution to revenue is deemed to be organic. Integration costs are expected to be in the range of DKK 15-20m. Costs relating to structural changes, including regulatory issues in Israel, will be reported separately.

Currency expectations The outlook for 2016/17 is based on the following exchange rate assumptions:

USD/DKK CNY/DKK MYR/DKK GBP/DKK

2016/17 665

Change in relation to 2015/16

Just over 50% of Ambu's total revenue is invoiced in USD. In addition, just under 45% of revenue is invoiced in EUR or DKK, and the remaining 5% in GBP. Production costs are settled in USD, MYR and CNY.
Against this background, the effect on Ambu's EBIT of changes in the average exchange rates of USD, MYR and CNY from 2015/16 to 2016/17 is expected to be minimal. The effect of an expected 14% weakening of the GBP/DKK exchange rate is expected to impact the EBIT margin negatively to the order of 0.5 percentage points, as compared with the exchange rates realised in 2015/16.
The effect of a strengthening of 10% relative to the Danish krone is estimated to be as follows for the main currencies:

Financial outlook The financial outlook, calculated at the expected exchange rates for 2016/17, may be summarised as follows: · Organic growth in local currencies of approx. 8-10% · EBIT margin before special items of approx. 18% · Free cash flows before special items of approx.
DKK 175m · Gearing (NIBD/EBITDA) of approx. 1.75

Special items are made up of integration costs in respect of ETView Medical Ltd., which are expected to be in the range DKK 15-20m.
The outlook for the free cash flows corresponds to approx. 8% of revenue. This takes account of investments in buildings, including a new factory in Malaysia, of approx. DKK 100m.
When adjusted for investments in buildings of DKK 100m, FY 2016/17 is expected to see free cash flows of approx. 12% of revenue, corresponding to the cash flows realised in 2015/16. The outlook for free cash flows for 2016/17 takes account of significantly increased investments in innovation, which will be financed through continued improvements in the working capital.
Acquisitions and partnerships As an integrated part of the Climbing New Heights strategy, Ambu is working to identify companies and products that can supplement its current product portfolio. Ambu is also keen to enter into new partnerships with the potential to strengthen Ambu either commercially or technologically. The outlook for the year may naturally be affected by new acquisitions and/or major new partnerships.

Forward-looking statements Forward-looking statements, especially such as relate to future sales, operating income and other financial key figures, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Various factors, many of which are outside Ambu's control, may cause the actual development of the company to differ materially from the expectations contained in this report. Such factors include, but are not confined to, changes in market conditions and the competitive situation, changes in demand and purchasing patterns, fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates, and general economic, political and commercial conditions.

Financial results

Ambu revolutionised first aid in 1956 with the invention of the manual resuscitator ­ The Ambu Bag. The materials have changed, and today the bag is a single-use product, but the principle is still the same and saves lives every day all over the world.

Revenue and growth ­ product areas

Anaesthesia
In Q4, the Anaesthesia segment realised organic growth of 9% when measured both in local currencies and in Danish kroner. For the financial year, growth of 13% was posted in local currencies, or 15% in Danish kroner.
Total Anaesthesia sales accounted for 61% of Ambu's revenue in 2015/16 against 58% the year before.
Increased sales of videoscopes Growth in Anaesthesia is driven by an increase in sales of videoscopes, especially the aScope, and in 2015/16 a total of 200,000 videoscopes were sold against almost 100,000 in 2014/15, corresponding to a growth rate of 100%.
Following the launch of aScope Large in May 2016, the aScope product portfolio now consists of three variants: Slim, Regular and Large, each designed for different applications in hospital operating rooms and intensive care units. In September 2016, the US health authorities approved aScope Large for sale, allowing sales in the USA to start in Q1 2016/17.
Geographically, the growth in sales of aScope is broadly distributed. All three sales regions are reporting high double-digit growth in sales volumes in per cent, but the highest increase in sales can be seen in the North American market with triple-digit growth in volumes sold in per cent.

is not targeting. Partnerships are an important focus area in the Climbing New Heights strategy.
New factory in Malaysia aScope and Isiris production capacity currently totals 400,000 units, and in the light of the expected growth potential, a decision has been made to build a new factory in Malaysia. Once fully developed, the new factory will have the capacity to produce more than 3.5 million videoscopes. It is expected to be ready for operation in H1 2017/18.
Acquisition of new technology At the end of 2015/16, Ambu acquired ETView Medical Ltd., thereby also acquiring a fully developed single-use airway tube with an integrated camera. So far, the product has mainly been sold via distributors, but it will now be integrated into the Ambu aScope product portfolio. ETView enables constant monitoring of the positioning of the airway tube during surgical procedures. This means that ETView complements the existing aScope range by offering additional functionality in the form of continuous monitoring.
Lower growth across Anaesthesia Growth for the other Anaesthesia products ­ taken together ­ has been low. However, this is partly explained by timing differences in that sales of breathing circuits were affected by a contract in the USA, under which Ambu accepted to reduce prices by close to 10% with effect from Q1 2015/16.

The prices of aScope have generally been stable, and a margin of approx. 77% was realised in 2015/16, which corresponds to the margin realised in 2014/15. This is despite the increase in sales through distribution, as the relative share of scopes relative to monitors is continuously being improved.

The other top five Anaesthesia products, on the other hand, saw satisfactory growth somewhat above market growth. The products are resuscitators, laryngeal masks and face masks, which posted average growth of 4%.
Patient Monitoring & Diagnostics

Strategic partnerships The beginning of the year saw the launch of the urology product Isiris. The product represents the further development of the technological platform behind aScope, and has been developed in cooperation with Coloplast, which is also responsible for sales and distribution. Since the launch, the sales force has been trained, and Isiris has been introduced at hospitals in Europe. The necessary approvals are expected to be obtained in H1 2016/17, and will open the North American market to Isiris.
Ambu's cooperation with Coloplast is a good example of how development work with global partners makes it possible to address markets which we have not traditionally focused on, and which our own sales force

(PMD)
Within PMD, sales increased by 5% in Q4 when measured in local currencies, and by 4% in Danish kroner. For the financial year as a whole, growth of 3% was posted in local currencies, and 4% in Danish kroner.
Total PMD sales accounted for 39% of Ambu's revenue in 2015/16 against 42% the year before.
The PMD business area consists of three product lines: cardiology, neurophysiology and first aid. Cardiology accounts for approx. 50% of PMD sales, while the other two areas each account for around 25%.
Within PMD, neurophysiology is posting the strongest growth with double-digit growth rates for both Q4 and for

The market for cardiology came under pressure in 2015/16, but the overall growth for the business area was still positive both in Q4 and for the year as a whole. FY 2014/15 saw the divestment of the electrode factory in the UK, and production is now handled by an Indian partner. This cooperation is progressing according to

plan, and is contributing to stabilising earnings within cardiology.
In Q4, we launched a number of new PMD products which will contribute to increased growth in the future. They include a new generation of wireless manikins for training in, for example, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and the use of defibrillators.

Revenue and growth ­ markets

Q4
Q4 was, as usual, somewhat busier than the three previous quarters with revenue of DKK 573m (DKK 536m) being realised, which corresponds to growth of 8% (10%) in local currencies and 7% (21%) in Danish kroner. Revenue for Q4 amounted to 27.5% (28.4%) of revenue for the year.
Satisfactory single-digit growth in revenue was realised in Europe and North America as well as very high growth in the rest of the world.
Quarterly revenue (DKKm)

FY 2015/16
Revenue for the year was DKK 2,084m based on growth of 9% (9%) in local currencies and 10% (19%) in Danish kroner. Posting total growth of 9% in local currencies, Ambu is continuously strengthening its position in all three regions, while at the same time having fulfilled ­ one year ahead of schedule ­ its strategic target for 2016/17 of revenue of DKK 2bn, when measured at fixed exchange rates.
In North America, growth in local currencies totalled 7% (8%). Ambu's growth in sales in the USA has been negatively affected by a price reduction on breathing circuits; a three-year agreement has been made with a US GPO concerning a price reduction of close to 10% in return for exclusivity.

The effect of aScope 3 is significant, but sales of face masks, ventilation bags, needle electrodes and breathing circuits have also contributed significantly to the growth realised.

In Q4, growth in local currencies totalled 5% (16%) in Europe, and 7% (12%) in North America. In both markets, Ambu achieved growth clearly above market growth, which shows that Ambu is continuing to win market share in spite of the fact that competition is fierce.
In the rest of the world, growth of 18% (-10%) was realised in Q4 when measured in local currencies, driven by growth of 29% (22%) in Asia and Oceania, which was very positive.

In September 2015, Ambu entered into an agreement with Tri-anim Healthcare Services concerning the sale and distribution of, for example, aScope 3 in the USA. Tri-anim has an extensive sales and distribution structure focused on operating rooms and intensive care units, and made an increasing contribution to growing sales of aScope in 2015/16. Based on the current run rate, sales in North America account for close to half of total sales, in terms of volumes.
In Europe, growth in local currencies totalled 11% (11%). This is significantly higher than market growth, and shows that we are capable of winning market share. In addition, we can see that our new products are helping to boost sales of the rest of the product portfolio. Growth in Europe is broadly distributed on the underlying markets.
In the rest of the world, growth of 8% (7%) was reported in local currencies. As can be seen, this represents a

modest increase relative to the year before. The modest growth rate is primarily due to the Middle East and Latin America, where the economic situation remains difficult. In the markets in Asia and Oceania, Ambu is posting significantly higher growth of 22% (24%) for 2015/16.
In 2015/16, we strengthened our sales force by establishing direct sales in Japan and Norway, as we see a considerable potential in these markets.
Currency exposure Just over 50% of Ambu's total revenue is invoiced in USD. In addition, just under 45% of revenue is invoiced in EUR or DKK, and the remaining 5% in GBP.

Production costs are settled in USD, MYR and CNY.
In 2015/16, the average USD/DKK exchange rate was 671 (651) corresponding to an increase of 3%, while the average CNY/DKK and MYR/DKK rates fell 1% and 9%, respectively. The price of GBP has dropped dramatically since June 2016, translating into a 5% fall in the average GBP/DKK exchange rate for the year relative to 2014/15.
The fluctuations in these four main currencies correspond to an increase in revenue of approx. DKK 25m or a 1% increase in growth.

Income statement
Change in the classification of costs In connection with the presentation of the annual report for 2015/16, certain freight costs and administrative expenses have been reclassified to ensure a clearer presentation of the cost base.
In the past, Ambu has recorded freight costs under both production costs and selling costs. The freight costs associated with shipping finished products from factories to central storage facilities have thus been recognised under production costs, while the freight costs associated with shipping from central storage facilities to customers have been seen as part of selling costs. However, in future, all shipping of finished products will be recognised under selling costs, regardless of the destination.
In addition, administrative expenses linked to factories and sales companies have historically been recognised under Management and Administration rather than under the respective functions. These expenses relate to the supervision of sales or production processes, for which reason they have been reclassified.
The reclassification has been applied with effect from Q4 2015/16; comparative figures have been restated for the past seven quarters, i.e. from the beginning of FY 2014/15. Moreover, the financial highlights have been restated accordingly. The effect of the reclassification is an improvement in the gross profit margin of approx. 2 percentage points for each accounting period and a corresponding increase in the rate of cost. The EBIT margin is unaffected by this.
Gross profit The gross profit increased by 17% to DKK 1,124m (DKK 961m), while the gross margin increased from 50.9% to 53.9%.
The gross profit is positively impacted by the fact that sales of videoscopes are up 100%, while growth from core products ­ taken together ­ has been low.
Gross profit is affected positively by economies of scale at the factories in step with the volume increases as well as savings realised by the factories. The direct

production costs have been reduced by the equivalent of an approx. 1 percentage point gross margin increase. The improvements have taken place across factories and products.
The improvement of the gross margin has been constant over the course of a year, increasing from 52.6% in Q1 to 55.5% in Q4.
In 2015/16, the aggregate effect of pressure on prices is deemed to have been in the range of 0.5-1.0%, and is thus unchanged relative to previous years. This is reflected in the improved gross margin, as explained above. Price pressures affect all products with the exception of aScope, which is largely sold at agreed fixed prices.
Costs Ambu has a strong focus on cost control, and the rate of cost has been reduced significantly over the past three years. Total capacity costs increased to DKK 768m (DKK 725m). This includes an increase in capacity costs of approx. DKK 15m as a result of changes in exchange rates.
The rate of cost was 37% (38%), corresponding to a reduction of 1 percentage point.
Selling and distribution costs increased by just under 3%. The underlying increase in the pure selling costs is somewhat above this level, but is reduced by freight and distribution cost savings of approx. 1 percentage point of revenue. These savings have been realised partly as a result of improved resource utilisation and partly on account of low freight rates for container transport from Asia to both Europe and the USA.
Development costs increased by DKK 11m, corresponding to 20%, while the cash effect of the development activities increased by DKK 7m, corresponding to 12%, cf. note 2.5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Management and administrative expenses increased by 13% to DKK 221m. The increase is due to an increase in activity levels back in H2 2014/15, which was only fully

16

phased in in 2015/16, after which the quarterly management and administrative expenses will be constant (approx. DKK 55m). Rate of cost ­ five-year summary
Operating income (EBIT) EBIT was DKK 356m (DKK 236m), corresponding to an EBIT margin of 17.1% (12.5%) and thus an increase of more than 50% in EBIT in nominal terms. This includes minor exchange rate effects of approx. DKK 10m. With an EBIT margin of 17.1%, the strategic target for 2016/17 has been met one year early. EBIT (DKKm) and EBIT margin

Tax on profit for the year The profit for the year adjusted for non-deductible and non-taxable items is taxed at a rate of 23% (29%). The substantial reduction in the effective tax rate is due to a different distribution of profit between territories compared to 12 months ago, resulting in increased tax efficiency.
Net profit This results in a net profit of DKK 250m (DKK 152m).
Balance sheet
At the end of September 2016, Ambu had total assets of DKK 2,366m (DKK 2,254m).
Working capital has been reduced to DKK 521m (DKK 551m), corresponding to 25% (29%) of revenue for the year. Following this reduction, Ambu has achieved the long-term target for a reduction in funds tied up defined in 2013 for the current strategy period, and which was to be achieved by the end of 2016/17. The reason for this significant reduction is primarily a considerable reduction in overdue debtors as well as general increases in the efficiency of the related processes. In addition, the inventory turnover ratio has been increased.
At year end, trade receivables amounted to DKK 418m (DKK 473m). This corresponds to a reduction in the average number of credit days by 15 to 67 days at the end of the year. The efforts which have gone into improving the collection of trade receivables have thus had a significant, positive effect in 2015/16.
The credit risk attaching to outstanding debtors is deemed to be unchanged, and the year was not affected by bad debts to any significant extent.
Working capital relative to revenue*

Net financials Net financial expenses of DKK 30m were posted, against net financial expenses of DKK 21m the year before. The change is attributable to lower market value adjustments and fair value adjustment of earn-out in 2014/15. The changes are composed as follows:
· Interest expenses on bank and bond debt totalled DKK -30m (DKK -29m).
· Translation adjustments of working capital and USD loans to a subsidiary as well as market value adjustments of interest and foreign currency swaps resulted in aggregate foreign currency translation adjustments of DKK +4m (DKK -10m).
· Adjustment of the earn-out provision and the interest element of shorter discounting period of DKK -4m (DKK +18m).

* Pro forma-adjusted for King Systems
At the end of the year, inventories totalled DKK 287m (DKK 278m).
At the end of September 2016, cash totalled DKK 35m (DK 48m), in addition to which Ambu had unutilised credit facilities totalling DKK 135m.
At the end of September 2016, financial net debt totalled DKK 955m (DKK 731m), of which DKK 700.5m is financed via corporate bonds. Interest-bearing net debt totalled 2.1 (2.2) x EBITDA for the year.

Cash flow statement
Free cash flows Cash flows from operating activities amounted to DKK 369m (DKK 208m).
Payments of income tax totalling DKK 75m (DKK 37m) are recognised due to timing differences. Changes in working capital make a positive contribution of DKK 8m (DKK -70m) to cash flows, as trade receivables were significantly reduced in the course of the year.
Cash flows from investing activities before company acquisitions totalled DKK -84m (DKK -101m), corresponding to 4% (5%) of revenue. Investments consist mainly of investments in production plant and equipment, and development projects. The falling level of investment is due to the last instalment of DKK 15m having been paid in respect of the new factory in Malaysia in 2014/15. Adjusted for this, the level of investment is unchanged.
Free cash flows before acquisitions of enterprises and technology hereafter amounted to DKK 285m (DKK 107m), corresponding to 14% (6%) of revenue.
The purchase price agreed for ETView Medical Ltd. was USD 16m on a debt-free basis, corresponding to DKK 107m, of which an amount of DKK 93m is recognised under investing activities. The remaining DKK 14m concerns non-interest-bearing debt which Ambu takes

over and settles as it falls due. At the end of 2015/16, DKK 10m had been paid, while DKK 4m falls due later.
Acquisitions of enterprises and technology reduced cash flows by DKK -155m (DKK -17m). The acquired assets include both the intellectual property rights related to one of Ambu's most important product lines, breathing circuits, which were acquired in May 2016 at a price of USD 9m, or DKK 59m, and the acquisition of ETView Medical Ltd. in August 2016 at a price of DKK 93m.
Free cash flows after acquisitions of enterprises and technology amounted to DKK 130m (DKK 90m).
Financing activities Cash flows from financing activities totalled DKK -80m (DKK -92m), and relate to dividend and incentive scheme payments as well as the acquisition of treasury shares.
In the course of the financial year, two share buyback programmes were initiated to cover outstanding share option programmes. Both share buyback programmes have now been completed, and all outstanding share options are fully covered. At the end of September 2016, Ambu's portfolio of treasury shares comprised 1,365,472 shares, corresponding to 2.82% of the outstanding Class A and Class B share capital.

Risk management
Ambu has established policies and procedures which guarantee the efficient management of the identified risks, and the Ambu management focuses on ensuring satisfactory clarity about the group's risks at all times.
Risk policy and risk-taking
Risk assessments are naturally integrated into Ambu's decision-making processes, and an important element in ensuring continued growth. Risk management also contributes to protecting Ambu's business, employees, assets and reputation.
Ambu's activities involve a number of general and specific commercial and financial risks which may have a negative impact on the company's future growth, activities, financial standing and results. Ambu seeks to identify and quantify these risks via internal control and risk management systems, and the risks are hedged and limited to the greatest possible extent. However, the nature of Ambu's business, including the development of new products, means that the company undertakes risks on an ongoing basis. The risk management systems are designed to ensure that only calculated risks are taken, and that these are constantly monitored and managed.
The risks which are deemed to have the largest potential impact on Ambu's business are described below. The description is not necessarily exhaustive, however, and the risk factors are not ranked in any order of priority.
Commercial risks
Competition and market conditions In all Ambu's most important markets, there is constant economic and political focus on reducing healthcare costs ­ a trend which is only further exacerbated in an environment of low global economic growth. At the same time, there is a general demand for efficiency increases in the healthcare sector. These structural changes are leading to a pressure on prices, while at the same time low-priced copies of products are being marketed in some product areas.
Ambu is constantly seeking to adapt its business to respond to these trends, among other things via the following activities: · As an integrated part of product development, the
question of how new products can contribute to streamlining hospital routines is considered. This is a principal element in the development of single-use products. Through clinical and health economics studies, Ambu is also working to document the savings and benefits of using Ambu's products, and the resulting data are used actively in connection with sales activities. A good example is Ambu's visualisation products. · Ambu is constantly seeking to position its products in a manner which ensures that price is not the determining sales parameter. · Over the past few years, Ambu has upgraded its competences within sales via group purchasing

organisations (GPOs). In Ambu USA, significant competences have been built up over many years within this area, as a large part of hospital purchasing takes place via this channel. In Europe, the proportion of purchases made via group purchasing organisations is stable, but on the other hand, the use of public tenders is widespread. · By having factories in China, Malaysia and the USA, production costs are optimised, and close interaction is maintained with the most important markets, thereby maintaining Ambu's competitiveness. There is ongoing focus on optimising production and on identifying the most expedient locations and structure, including partnerships with production in India. · In recent years, Ambu has focused on optimising its supply chains. An efficient and competitive supply chain is crucial to ensuring that we can control the commercial and regulatory risks to which we are exposed by virtue of our global presence.
Product development Ambu's possibilities for realising its strategic targets depend on its ability to develop unique, high-quality products.
Ambu takes a targeted approach to improving its existing products, developing new products and generally strengthening the company's ability to innovate, for example by ensuring a strong commercial focus in its product development activities. Considerable investments are continuously being made in product development and the marketing of new products, and resources are continuously being invested in systems which can monitor the contributions made by individual projects and products to achieving the financial targets.
Ability to attract and retain employees In order to attract and retain employees with the right competences, Ambu focuses on developing the individual employee, on continuous career development and on delegating a considerable degree of responsibility to its employees.
Trademarks, branding and patents The company logo and name create coherence between the company and its products and make the company easily recognisable to its customers and stakeholders. The Ambu name is included in all product names, and the active branding is intended to help prevent plagiarism. A branding strategy and a branding manual have been prepared to ensure the ongoing updating of the Ambu brand.
It is company policy to patent products with a high market value or growth potential. In the medtech industry, opinions often differ as to whether a given product is patented or not, for which reason patent cases may result in considerable costs to protect Ambu's rights or to defend Ambu against alleged infringements of patents. To minimise the risk of such cases being instituted, before embarking on any new projects, Ambu makes a

23

point of ascertaining whether patents exist within a particular project area, thereby establishing what sort of `freedom to operate' Ambu can expect.
Production and quality Operating disturbances or stoppages at Ambu's production units may affect Ambu's ability to deliver. In order to manage this risk, the production units are subject to regular inspections, including inspections by external insurance brokers and other consultants. The conclusions from such reviews, combined with our own ongoing monitoring of the production environment, regularly result in the introduction of new measures in the form of fire protection, validation of alternative suppliers of critical components and raw materials as well as the building of safety stocks.
The siting of Ambu's production facilities has been based on a risk assessment, including, among other things, an assessment of the risk of natural disasters, of the political climate, of issues related to foreign exchange and of the possibilities of attracting employees with the required qualifications.
In step with the growth in revenue, production capacity is continuously being assessed, resulting in continuous expansion of Ambu's production facilities as well as factory capacity.
Ambu's products are most often used in critical situations, and product quality is vital to the company's commercial success. Quality assurance is therefore a focus area for Ambu, both due to external regulatory requirements and as an active commercial parameter. With a view to meeting user needs and minimising patient risks, risk assessments, clinical trials and process validations are carried out in connection with product development and production, and Ambu's quality organisation is strengthened on an ongoing basis. Ambu lives up to the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European CE requirements.
The FDA carried out two inspections of Ambu in FY 2015/16 (as opposed to one inspection the year before), which were so-called routine inspections. The inspections took place at our factories in Malaysia and China in April and May, respectively, in 2016. Both visits resulted in a small number of simple recommendations, which could quickly be implemented. With regard to the FDA Warning Letter issued to the factory in the USA in October 2013, the FDA paid its most recent visit to this factory in March 2015. Ambu has since allocated

considerable resources to making the required improvements and corrections to the processes used. The Warning Letter stands, but has only limited commercial impact, and we are therefore now awaiting a visit by the FDA to the factory and hopefully a decision to issue a Warning Letter close-out letter.
Ambu organises regular mock inspections by independent consultants with a view to ensuring continuous improvements to our system and process quality.
IT security Ambu has established special procedures to be followed in the event of potential IT breakdowns. The emergency support system includes, among other things, the conclusion of service level agreements for all businesscritical systems and the use of external data hosting, while redundancy has been established for the most important business systems. In recognition of the complexity of maintaining the emergency support system ­ and for example retaining the necessary IT expertise ­ a decision has been made to outsource certain IT operations. As from the end of Q3 2016/17, the operation and maintenance of networks and servers, including back-up processes, access control and firewalls, will be outsourced to a partner.
Insurance The company's insurance policy lays down the overall framework for the extent and management of insurance risks. The insurance policy contains guidelines on the group's security and insurance matters. Insurance matters and insurance risks are assessed annually in cooperation with insurance brokers. In addition to statutory insurance cover, the company has taken out product liability and operating loss insurance. Properties, operating equipment and inventories are covered on an all-risk basis at replacement cost.
Financial risks
The developments in Ambu's results and equity are impacted by a number of financial risks, including foreign exchange risks, interest rate risks, liquidity risks and credit risks. Ambu has centralised the management of financial risks in the group's finance function, which also acts as a service centre for all subsidiaries. The group does not engage in speculative transactions. Financial risks and financial risk management are described in further detail in note 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Corporate governance

Principles

Ambu is managed with reference to the company's

vision, mission, values, Code of Conduct and the Five

Star Leadership management concept. The legal

framework for Ambu's management is constituted mainly

by statutory requirements, stock exchange rules and

company

law,

NASDAQ

Copenhagen's

Recommendations on Corporate Governance, best

practice and the company's internal rules on insider

trading and the handling of confidential information by

management and employees.

Shareholders
The shareholders own Ambu and exercise their right to make decisions at the annual general meeting, for example adopting the annual report, deciding on amendments to the Articles of Association, electing members of the Board of Directors and appointing the company's auditors. At the annual general meeting, shareholders are entitled to ask the Board of Directors and the Executive Board questions and suggest items for consideration.

All shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting. The notice convening the annual general meeting is published at least three weeks and at the most five weeks before the date of the meeting. The documents are sent out to shareholders who have requested that the notice be sent out. The notice can also be found on the Ambu website.

Ambu's Articles of Association do not impose any restrictions on ownership or voting rights, but the share capital is divided into Class A and Class B shares. Class A shares carry ten votes per share, while Class B shares carry one vote per share.
The Class A shares are non-negotiable, and according to Ambu's Articles of Association, a transfer of more than 5% of the total number of Class A shares at a price higher than that quoted for the company's Class B shares can take place only if the buyer offers all holders of Class A and Class B shares to buy their shares at the same price.
The Board of Directors regularly discusses the existing ownership structure with the holders of Class A shares. The Board of Directors and the holders of Class A shares agree that the ownership structure has been and remains expedient for all the company's stakeholders, as it creates a sound framework for the implementation of Ambu's strategy and plans, thereby safeguarding the interests of all shareholders. Moreover, the ownership structure does not restrict the planned activities in any way.

Board of Directors
Ambu has a two-tier management structure, consisting of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The two bodies are independent of each other, and there is no overlap in membership.

On behalf of the shareholders, the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall management of Ambu, the formulation of objectives and strategies as well as the approval of the overall budgets and action plans. The Board of Directors also performs overall supervision of the company's activities, and ensures that Ambu is managed in a responsible manner and in compliance with legislation and the Articles of Association.
Composition of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors currently has six members who have been elected by the shareholders at the annual general meeting and three members elected by the employees pursuant to the Danish rules on employee representation. The members elected by the shareholders are elected for one year at a time. The age limit is 65 years for new appointments and 70 years for reappointments. The employee-elected members are elected for a four-year term as stipulated by law.
A gradual succession has taken place in recent years among the members elected by the shareholders. While the chairman and the vice-chairman have been members of the Board of Directors for six years, the other members have been on the Board of Directors for between one and five years. The succession has brought new competences to the Board of Directors, and a good mix of different experience, backgrounds and ages has been created.
For the Board of Directors to undertake its responsibilities and act as a good sounding board for the Executive Board and the Executive Management Team, the following competences are particularly relevant: Insights into the management of a global growth company, insights into the medico and medtech industries with both public and private-sector customers, experience with innovation, experience with the acquisition and divestment of enterprises and insights into risk management and financial affairs. Ambu's Board of Directors is deemed to possess these competences and to be of the right size.
None of the members elected by the shareholders represent a controlling shareholder or have direct or indirect interests in the company over and above their interests as shareholders. All members elected by the annual general meeting are considered to be independent members, as defined by NASDAQ Copenhagen.
Duties of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors held a total of 12 meetings during the financial year, of which 11 were physical meetings and one was a conference call. The previous year, seven meetings were held. On one occasion, one board member elected by the general meeting was unable to attend.
The Executive Management Team participates in the meetings of the Board of Directors to ensure a direct dialogue and that the Board of Directors is well-informed about the company's operations.

25

Moreover, the Audit Committee held four meetings during the year. The Audit Committee consists of three members of the Board of Directors, in addition to which the President & CEO and the CFO participate in the meetings. The auditors appointed by the general meeting also participate in the meetings. The purpose of the committee is to assist the Board of Directors in ensuring the quality and integrity of the presentation of the company's financial statements, reporting and auditing.
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses Ambu's risk exposure and initiatives launched to counter these risks. At the same time, the committee monitors all accounting and reporting processes, the auditing process and the work and independence of external auditors. The Charter of the Audit Committee and the review of the control and risk management systems in connection with the financial reporting can be found at www.ambu.com/auditcom.
The Board of Directors has set up a Remuneration Committee with three members of the Board of Directors, which held four meetings in the course of the financial year. Ambu's President & CEO participates in the meetings. The duties of the committee are to ensure that the remuneration offered by Ambu is competitive and sufficient to attract and retain the members of the Executive Board and to recommend future incentive schemes. The Charter of the Remuneration Committee can be found at www.ambu.com/remunerationcom.
In addition, the Board of Directors has established a Nomination Committee, which consists of the chairman and the vice-chairman of the Board of Directors. Ambu's President & CEO occasionally participates in the committee meetings. The committee has held one meeting. The Nomination Committee is charged with evaluating the composition of the Executive Management Team and with evaluating and possibly renewing the Board of Directors so as to ensure that the board members live up to the requirements and possess the skills needed in a fast-growing company. The Charter of the Nomination Committee can be found at www.ambu.com/nominationcom.
The Board of Directors is authorised to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10% of Ambu's share capital and to increase the share capital by up to 9.9%.
Executive Board
The Board of Directors appoints the Executive Board and lays down its terms of employment. The Executive Board is responsible for Ambu's day-to-day management, including the development of Ambu's activities and operations, its risk management, financial reporting and internal affairs. The Executive Board also prepares the company's strategy, budgets and targets for presentation to the Board of Directors. The delegation of powers and responsibilities by the Board of Directors to the Executive Board is described in Ambu's Order of Business and the provisions of the Danish Companies Act (Selskabsloven).
The Executive Board consists of President & CEO Lars Marcher and CFO Michael Højgaard.

Corporate governance
The Board of Directors has considered the new recommendations from the Committee on Corporate Governance (www.corporategovernance.dk) from May 2013, and which was most recently amended in November 2015, and has systematically reviewed the recommendations in a document which can be found on the Ambu website (www.ambu.com/corpgov).
Ambu complies with all the committee's recommendations.
Report on the gender
composition of management,
pursuant to Section 99 b of the
Danish Financial Statements Act
Both on the Board of Directors and generally, Ambu will ensure that the most qualified person is appointed to a given position. The performance of all employees and managers is therefore assessed with reference to individual targets, and managers at all levels are measured in 180-degree surveys and assessed by their superiors and employees with reference to the Five Star Leadership management concept. The evaluations form the basis of, for example, promotions and the delegation of new responsibilities to ensure that such decisions are based on performance and objective criteria.
As a global group, Ambu wants to encourage diversity and create equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity and political and religious convictions. This ambition is described in Ambu's Code of Conduct, which can be found on the Ambu website (www.ambu.com/CoC), and a policy has been prepared to ensure an increased proportion of women in management.
According to this policy, Ambu will work to find more female candidates with a view to increasing the underrepresented gender's share of members of the Board of Directors elected by the annual general meeting to at least one out of six by 2017. At present, all members of the Board of Directors elected by the shareholders are men, while two of the employee-elected members of the Board of Directors are women. In December 2015, two of the Board members elected by the shareholders were replaced with a view to strengthening the skills of the Board of Directors within production and innovation. In order to identify the right candidates, the Nomination Committee was assisted by an external recruitment agency, which was asked to present the Nomination Committee with a broad field of international applicants, including at least one qualified candidate of each gender for the two seats on the Boards of Directors. However, the choice fell on two male candidates as they were deemed to be the most highly qualified, and the above targets have thus not yet been met.
For companies covered by the requirements of Section 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the proportion of female managers at other management levels, i.e. employees with staff responsibility, is 40%.

26

In recruiting managers, Ambu will continue to ensure that the proportion of female candidates short-listed for a position equals the proportion of female applicants. In connection with promotions to managerial positions, Ambu will endeavour to ensure that at least one female candidate is considered.

For a complete report on Ambu's corporate governance, including the policy on diversity and the Board of Directors' views on all the recommendations from the Committee on Corporate Governance, see the Corporate Governance section on the website (www.ambu.com/corpgov).

Remuneration

Remuneration policy According to the remuneration policy adopted by the general meeting, the remuneration paid to the Board of Directors and the Executive Board must be competitive and ensure that Ambu is able to attract and retain the necessary competences. The remuneration offered must also be structured so as to promote value creation and appropriately align the interests of the management with the interests of the shareholders.
Executive Board The remuneration for the Executive Board is determined by the Board of Directors based on market levels, Ambu's financial position and the competences, efforts and results of the individual members of the Executive Board. Members of the Executive Board receive a fixed basic remuneration, the usual benefits such as company car and telephone, pension as well as cash bonuses and share options. In the past financial year, the remuneration received by the Executive Board totalled DKK 15.9m (DKK 13.0m), which is composed as follows for the two executives:

Ambu has one-year bonus programmes for the Executive Board and the rest of the Executive Management Team as well as other managers and specialists. The Executive Management Team receives a cash bonus if the company as a whole meets the targets defined. Bonuses for other managers and specialists are conditional upon overall targets for the company as well as area-specific targets.
The notices of termination to be given by Ambu to members of the Executive Board cannot exceed 18 months, and the notice of termination to be given by the members of the Executive Board to Ambu cannot normally exceed 9 months. Moreover, any severance pay to members of the Executive Board, for example in the event of a change of control, is subject to a maximum value corresponding to two years' remuneration.

Board of Directors Members of the Board of Directors do not receive variable remuneration and are not part of share-based incentive programmes, but receive a fixed annual remuneration, which is approved by the general meeting.
In 2015/16, the basic remuneration for board members, which was most recently adjusted at the general meeting in December 2014, constituted DKK 225,000. The Chairman receives three times the basic remuneration, while the Vice-Chairman receives two times the basic remuneration. Furthermore, the chairmen of the board committees receive a remuneration of DKK 125,000, while committee members receive DKK 75,000. The total remuneration paid to the Board of Directors, including the board committees, constituted DKK 3,250,000 in 2015/16. (2014/15: DKK 3,250,000). Members of the Nomination Committee do not receive a separate fee.
Share options In November 2015, Ambu introduced a new share option scheme for the Executive Management Team, as the allocation of shares under the previous scheme from 2013 stopped at the end of FY 2014/15.
The new 2015 scheme comprises a total of 289,708 share options, which were allocated in November 2015. Final allocation is conditional upon the achievement of certain financial targets in each of the financial years 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18. The financial targets are determined by the Board of Directors for one year at a time and announced in the annual report.
Calculated according to the Black-Scholes model, the total value of the scheme is DKK 7m, and the costs associated with the scheme have been expensed on a continuous basis ­ in 2015/16, a total of DKK 1.9m was expensed in respect of the scheme.
Based on the results for FY 2015/16, 77,134 options will be allocated to the two members of Ambu's Executive Board, while 33,788 options will be allocated to the other three members of the Executive Management Team. 178,786 options already allocated are now outstanding for final allocation during the next two financial years subject to the achievement of the financial targets.
The allocation of the options is regulated by the guidelines for incentive pay adopted by the general meeting in December 2014.

Shareholders and investor relations

Return The opening price quoted for Ambu's Class B share at the beginning of the financial year was 181, rising to a closing level at the end of the financial year of 356, thereby securing a 97% return for shareholders, exclusive of dividend. By comparison, the MidCap index on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen rose by 8% in the same period, while the Health Care index decreased by 9%.
The change in the share price increased Ambu's market capitalisation from DKK 8.7bn to DKK 17.2bn, with the value of both Class A and Class B shares being recognised at the price quoted for the Class B share. Ambu's market capitalisation is thus the highest among the MidCap companies listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen.

in the prospectus in connection with the listing of Ambu A/S in 1992. In November 2015, a new shareholders' agreement was made between the holders of the Class A shares, in which the agreed terms and conditions were updated. The updated shareholders' agreement now regulates the relationship between the three lines of the family and the family's views on the company's dividend policy, the appointment of candidates to the Board of Directors of the company, decisions concerning the possible conversion of Class A shares into Class B shares as well as the process of transferring or selling Class A shares.
The shareholders' agreement regulates only the family's holdings of Class A shares, while family's holdings of listed Class B shares are not regulated by the shareholders' agreement.

Ambu's Articles of Association also contain provisions on the trading of Class A shares.

In addition to the Class A shares, the family also holds 2,864,859 Class B shares, corresponding to 6.9% (of the Class B share capital). The family thus controls a total of 20.1% (20.8%) of the combined Class A and Class B share capital and 64.9% (65.2%) of the votes. In the course of the year, the family sold approx. 0.4 million Class B shares.

Liquidity Approx. 12.6 million (14.3 million) shares were traded in the course of the financial year, corresponding to an average of 50,000 shares per business day, and 30% of the total number of Class B shares were thus traded, down from 35% the year before. At the end of September 2016, Ambu was thus the 35th-most traded share on NASDAQ Copenhagen based on trading over the preceding nine months.

The international ownership interest has increased slightly, and it is estimated that just over 26% (25%) of the capital is now owned by institutional investors from Sweden, the UK, Germany, the USA etc.
On 30 September 2016, the total number of shareholders in Ambu having arranged name registration of their holding was 6,393 (5,233), who held a combined 97% (90%) of the total share capital.
As at 30 September 2016, the following shareholders had filed ownership of more than 5% of the share capital and/or votes:

Shareholders The share capital has increased to DKK 120,926,800 following three capital increases in connection with the exercise of employee warrants issued in 2011 and 2012. The number of Class B shares has increased from 41,397,920 to 41,506,720 shares of DKK 2.50 each. The number of Class A shares is unchanged at 6,864,000 shares of DKK 2.50 each. There have been no changes in the rights attached to the shares or in the negotiability of the shares.
Ambu's Class B share is listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen under ISIN code DKK0010303619 and shortname AMBU-B, while the Class A share is unlisted and non-negotiable. All Class A shares are owned by the three lines of descendants of Ambu's founder Holger Hesse.
Back in 1987, a shareholders' agreement was made by the holders of the Class A shares, which was described

Corporate bonds In March 2013, Ambu issued corporate bonds generating proceeds of DKK 701m. The bonds were purchased by a circle of Danish and international institutional investors, and in December 2013 they were listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen.
Since the introduction in March 2013, the spread between the bond and the mid-swap curve has narrowed from 2.18% to approx. 0.93% as at 30 September 2016.
Investor relations Each quarter, a conference call has been held focusing on the interim report, and each quarter Ambu has participated in a considerable number of meetings and conferences with investors in Denmark and abroad.
Ambu strives to ensure a high and uniform level of information for its stakeholders, and seeks an active dialogue with investors, share analysts, journalists and the general public.
Communication takes the form of the regular issue of company announcements, investor presentations, conference calls, meetings etc. The aim is to ensure a well-founded share price that reflects both the actual and the expected creation of value in Ambu. This is done by ensuring that investors' knowledge of Ambu is up to date, and that Ambu is regarded as credible, accessible and professional.
The share is covered by analysts from ABG Sundal Collier, Carnegie Bank and Danske Market Equities.
The www.ambu.com website is updated on an ongoing basis with information about Ambu's results, activities and strategy, and all company announcements and financial statements can be viewed and downloaded there.
Ambu's IR policy now prescribes a four-week `quiet period' as opposed to three weeks. This means that Ambu does not comment on topics relating to Ambu's business and which may be price-sensitive during a period of four weeks up to the release of financial reports.
In the course of the financial year, Ambu issued 50 company announcements, of which 22 were announcements concerning insiders' trading in the share, share buy-back programmes and major shareholder announcements.
The people in charge of Investor Relations and the contact with analysts, investors, shareholders, the press etc. are:

Annual general meeting

Proposals to the annual general
meeting
The annual general meeting will be held on 12 December 2016 at IDA Mødecenter, Kalvebod Brygge 31-33, 1780 Copenhagen V, Denmark.

Ambu is developing positively and has posted high organic growth in recent years. Continuing this development and further strengthening Ambu's market position will require focused investments in both innovation and production. Ambu's strategy is to be open to acquisitions as well as investments in new technological platforms. It is Ambu's intention to continue to pursue a balanced dividend policy, distributing about 30% of the net profit for the year, but also to regularly review the dividend policy should investments or acquisitions significantly impact Ambu's debt structure.

The Board of Directors proposes to the annual general meeting that a dividend of DKK 1.55 (DKK 0.95) per share be declared for 2015/16, corresponding to 30% (30%) of the net profit for the year. The Board of Directors deems this to be a reasonable level in view of Ambu's financial resources and the outlook for the coming financial year.

Against this background, the Board of Directors proposes that the net profit for the year of DKK 250m be appropriated as follows (DKKm):

Dividend of DKK 1.55 per share

Payment of the dividend will be effected automatically via VP SECURITIES A/S immediately after the annual general meeting.
Moreover, the Board of Directors proposes to the annual general meeting: · that the Class A shares be registered with VP
securities and that the existing Class A share certificates be cancelled.

The agenda for the annual general meeting with annexes is expected to be announced on Friday 18 November 2016. On the website, shareholders can sign up to attend the annual general meeting, and download all relevant material in relation to the general meeting.

We are committed to abiding by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. In the absence of adequate laws and regulations, we refer to recognised international standards and industry norms.
Organisation of CSR work The CSR organisation has been strengthened, and the CSR work is now being handled by the executive vice presidents for Finance, Operations and Sales together with staff from R&D and the legal department. The CSR unit meets every quarter and on an ad hoc basis as and when required.
Ambu's CSR work in 2015/16
Below follows a description of the initiatives announced in the latest annual report, including the results achieved by Ambu in 2015/16.
Substitution of classified phthalates in products Ambu is dedicated to ensuring that our products are as safe for the environment and for patients as at all possible. Ambu has very successfully substituted classified phthalates in a wide range of products, for example laryngeal masks, face masks and resuscitators. In 2015/16, Ambu updated and extended its policy on the use of phthalates in medical devices to also include training manikins. The goal is to ensure that, by the end of 2019, all Ambu's products and training manikins are free of classified phthalates.

Human rights and business ethics We work continuously to strengthen our profile in the field of human rights and do not accept discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, skin colour, gender, age, sexual or political orientation, and we focus on ensuring that nobody is exposed to injustice or abuse, and that everybody enjoys freedom of speech.
We are continuing our work on human rights, among other things through our Code of Conduct, which supports the basic human rights, prohibits child labour and guarantees a safe work environment. Our Code of Conduct also prohibits bribery and corruption. With a view to aligning our ethical guidelines for important suppliers and distributors, we have in the current year combined our two codes of conduct for suppliers and distributors into a common set of rules, and the process of implementing the new Code of Conduct has been initiated.
We have not made observations that may indicate that our rules have been broken.
Ambu collaborates with educational institutions, which means that we take on trainees, interns and students for the benefit of both Ambu and the people concerned.
Work environment Ambu remains focused on ensuring a safe and healthy work environment, which has resulted in another green smiley from the Danish Working Environment Authority. Our production units follow the same management system.
Evaluating experience with end-of-life environmental profiles In cooperation with external partners, Ambu has prepared an end-of-life environmental profile for the aScope 3 videoscope. In the course of 2015/16, experience with end-of-life environmental profiles has been gained from the market. Environmental documentation in the form of end-of-life profiles are deemed to be relevant, but sometimes difficult to communicate.
Climate Ambu has obtained climate data from its production units pursuant to the guidelines described in the Green House Gas Protocol (GHGP) Scope 1 and Scope 2 for the past three years, and the data have been converted into CO2 equivalents per year. The data show that the development in CO2 emissions (in %) is less than the increase in production output (in tonnes). Ambu expects significant growth in the years to come. Increased production means an increased impact on the environment. Ambu will continue its work to reduce the increase in CO2 equivalents from production relative to the increase in production volumes.

34

Environment The production units have been working to increase the recycling of production waste via waste separation at source as well as selling the waste for recycling outside Ambu. Over a two-year period, we have succeeded in increasing the level of recycling significantly through focused efforts.

Initiatives in 2016/17
In the next financial year, focus will be on the following initiatives: · Continue the substitution of classified phthalates · Work to establish climate targets for the increase in
CO2 equivalents relative to the increase in production volumes · Continue the implementation of the updated Code of Conduct

35

Statements and reports
Ambu has developed training manikins since the 1960s. In 2016, we launched the new generation of Ambu® Man, which is a wireless manikin for training first aid. The product family consists of manikins in the following sizes: adult, junior and baby.

Independent auditor's report

To the shareholders of Ambu A/S
Auditor's report on the consolidated financial statements and the
financial statements
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of Ambu A/S for the financial year 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016, pp. 40-93, which comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including significant accounting policies for both the group and the company. The consolidated financial statements and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements and financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Furthermore, the management is responsible for maintaining such internal control as the management deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements pursuant to Danish audit legislation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Our audit has not resulted in any qualifications.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's and the company's assets and liabilities and financial position as at 30 September 2016 as well as of the results of their activities and cash flows for the financial year 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
Statement on the management's review
We have read the management's review pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act (Årsregnskabsloven), pp. 4-35. We have not performed procedures additional to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements. Against this background, we believe that the information provided in the management's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements.

Section 1: Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements
This section provides an overview of the accounting policies applied as well as material estimates and assessments by management. All the companies in the Ambu group follow the same accounting policies, and the basic practice is described in this section. The specific accounting policies are included under the respective notes in Sections 2-5.
45

Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements
Notes on the consolidated financial statements ­ Section 1

1.1 Basis of preparation

The group's general accounting policies are described below. In connection with this, specific accounting policies have been incorporated into each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements:

2.1 Revenue 2.2 Staff costs 2.3 Share-based payment 2.6 Other operating expenses 2.8 Tax on profit for the year 2.9 Provision for deferred tax

3.1 Intangible assets 3.2 Impairment test 3.3 Property, plant and equipment 3.4 Inventories 3.5 Trade receivables 4.2 Categories of financial instruments

4.3 Net financials 4.5 Share capital and treasury shares 4.6 Earnings per share 5.1 Other provisions 5.5 Divestment of subsidiary 5.9 Adoption of the annual report and distr. of profit

General The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the EU as well as additional Danish disclosure requirements for the annual reports of listed companies. Ambu A/S is a public limited company domiciled in Denmark.

The financial statements of the parent company Ambu A/S are presented separately from the consolidated financial statements and can be found on the last pages of this report. The parent company's separate accounting policies are shown in conjunction with the financial statements of the parent company.

The accounting policies described below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in the years presented. Accounting policies have been applied consistently with previous years with the exception of the changed classification described in note 1.2.

Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is also Ambu A/S's functional currency. All amounts are rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.

The annual report has been prepared in accordance with the historical cost principle, except for derivative financial instruments and earn-out obligations presented as other provisions, which are measured at fair value.

Definition of materiality The consolidated financial statements represent matters that have been deemed to be material or required under the IFRS provisions or additional Danish disclosure requirements.

Ambu includes qualitative and quantitative factors when assessing whether a relationship is material. If the presentation or disclosure of a matter does not increase the informative value for the person reading the financial statements, the matter is deemed to be immaterial.

Material accounting estimates In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the management makes material accounting estimates, assessments and assumptions which form the basis of the presentation, recognition and measurement of the group's assets and liabilities for accounting purposes.

The estimates made are based on assumptions deemed to be reasonable by the management, but which are naturally subject to uncertainty. Such assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or incidents may occur. Furthermore, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause the actual results to deviate from the estimates.

Information about material estimates, assessments and assumptions applied where a change will significantly impact the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:

2.1 Revenue 2.9 Provision for deferred tax

3.1 Intangible assets 3.2 Impairment test

3.4 Inventories

Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise Ambu A/S and companies in which Ambu A/S has a controlling interest. Control is deemed to be obtained if Ambu A/S owns more than 50% of the voting rights, or if Ambu A/S in any other way has a controlling interest in the company.

The subsidiaries' financial statements are adjusted if necessary to ensure that their accounting policies are consistent with those of the rest of the group. All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are fully eliminated on consolidation.

46

Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements
Notes on the consolidated financial statements ­ Section 1
1.1 Basis of preparation (continued)
Foreign currency translation A functional currency is determined for each company in the Ambu group. The functional currency is the currency used in the primary economic environment in which the individual subsidiary operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses in connection with the settlement of these transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at the exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement under financial items.
Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate applicable at the balance sheet date and the exchange rate applicable at the date on which the receivable or payable occurred or the exchange rate stated in the most recent annual report is recognised in the income statement under net financials.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to Danish kroner at the exchange rates for balance sheet items applicable at the balance sheet date and at average exchange rates as far as income statement items are concerned. Exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the net assets of such subsidiaries at the beginning of the year using the exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date and the translation of income statement items from the exchange rates applicable at the transaction date to the exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments under equity.
Foreign currency translation adjustment of intercompany balances, which are regarded as a supplement to the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, is recognised in the consolidated financial statements in other comprehensive income under a separate reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments.
New accounting regulation Ambu has adopted all relevant new and updated accounting standards issued by the IASB effective as of 1 October 2015. The adoption of these standards has not had a material financial effect on the statement of Ambu's results, assets and liabilities or equity in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the financial years presented.
No accounting standards need to be adopted in FY 2016/17 which will have a material financial effect on the statement of Ambu's results, assets and liabilities or equity in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for 2016/17.
Standards not yet adopted Other relevant standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB, but not yet approved by the EU, have not been incorporated into this annual report. These standards and interpretations are expected to be adopted when they become mandatory.
IFRS 15 `Revenue from Contracts with Customers' was issued in May 2014 and amended in April 2016. It will enter into force for financial years starting on 1 January 2018 and will thus apply as from Ambu's FY 2018/19. The management is currently assessing the effect of the new standard.
IFRS 16 `Leases' was issued in January 2016 and enters into force on 1 January 2019. The standard regulates the accounting treatment of leases and is expected to have a significant impact on the group's financial statements. The management has not made any calculations yet to clarify the impact of IFRS 16 on the group's accounting figures.
Presentation of income statement Income and expenses are recognised according to the accruals concept. The income statement is presented by functions where the respective cost impacts the function to which the cost is deemed to relate. The group's functions are divided into production, sales and distribution, development, as well as management and administration.
Production costs Production costs comprise costs incurred in generating the revenue for the year. Such costs include direct and indirect costs for commodities and consumables, freight costs incurred in connection with the purchase of commodities etc., production wages and salaries for support functions and factory management, rent and leases as well as depreciation and impairment of plant.
Selling and distribution costs Selling and distribution costs comprise costs for sales staff, advertising and exhibitions, depreciation, impairment and operation of central warehouses, as well as all costs relating to the transport of goods from the group's factories to the customers. In addition, amortisation of the identified intangible assets acquired by the company is recognised: Customer relations and trademarks.
47

Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements
Notes on the consolidated financial statements ­ Section 1
1.1 Basis of preparation (continued)
Development costs Development costs comprise salaries and costs which, directly or indirectly, can be attributed to product improvements and the development of new products which do not meet the criteria for capitalisation of an internally generated development project. In addition, the amortisation and impairment of capitalised development costs as well as amortisation of rights and acquired technologies are recognised.
Management and administrative expenses Administrative expenses comprise expenses incurred for management and administration, including expenses for the administrative staff, office premises and office expenses, as well as amortisation and impairment.
Presentation of balance sheet Prepayments Prepayments recognised under assets comprise costs incurred in respect of the coming financial year measured at cost.
Equity Reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated financial statements comprises exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries to DKK as well as foreign currency translation adjustments of intercompany balances regarded as a supplement to the net investment in foreign subsidiaries. Reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments was zeroed on 1 October 2004 in accordance with IFRS 1.
Business combinations Newly acquired enterprises are included in the consolidated financial statements as from the date of acquisition. Comparative figures are not restated for newly acquired enterprises. In connection with the acquisition of new enterprises in which Ambu obtains a controlling influence, the purchase method is applied. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprises are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised, provided that such assets can be recognised separately or originate from a contractual right and the fair value can be measured reliably. Deferred tax on the reassessments made is recognised. The date of acquisition is the date when Ambu obtains actual control over the acquired enterprise.
For business combinations, the positive balances (goodwill) between the cost of the enterprise and the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment test. The first impairment test is carried out by the end of the year of acquisition. Upon acquisition, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units, which will subsequently form the basis of an impairment test. Goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign entity with another functional currency than DKK are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated to the functional currency of such entity using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of enterprises are expensed.
Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared on the basis of the indirect method and shows the group's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year. Cash flows from operating activities comprise profit or loss before tax adjusted for non-cash operating items, changes in working capital, financial items received and paid and income tax paid. Cash flows from investing activities comprise payments made in connection with the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and activities, as well as investment, development, sale and improvements of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The conclusion of finance leases is considered to be non-cash transactions. Cash flows relating to assets held under finance leases are recognised as payment of interest and repayment of debt. Cash flows from financing activities comprise changes to the size or composition of share capital and costs incidental thereto as well as the arrangement of loans, the repayment of interest-bearing debt, the purchase and sale of treasury shares and the payment of dividend to the group's shareholders.
Cash flows denominated in currencies other than Danish kroner (DKK) are translated using average exchange rates, unless such rates deviate materially from the exchange rates applicable at the transaction date.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash less short-term bank debt.

1.2 C hange in the classification of certain items in the income statement

The comparative figures for FY 2014/15 have been restated as a result of a reclassification made between certain items in the income statement.
As a consequence of this reclassification, the group's costs for the transport of goods from the group's factories to central warehouses and to Ambu's customers have been grouped under Selling and distribution costs, and costs relating to function-specific employees, including middle managers and quality assurance staff, have been reclassified from Management and administrative expenses to either Production costs or Selling and distribution costs.

With this reclassification, the management assesses that the financial statements will to a greater extent reflect the actual distribution of the group's costs and resources between the various functions.

The impact of the changes on the comparative figures is shown below.

Net profit for the year
This section contains notes relating to the profit for the year from the group's activities.
In 2015/16, Ambu improved its operating profit (EBIT) by 4.6 percentage points to 17.1%, corresponding to an increase of DKK 120m.
The absolute increase was driven by reported growth of 10%, while a 3.0 percentage point improvement in the gross margin and a reduction in capacity costs of 1 percentage point increased the EBIT margin. By maintaining the same level of capacity costs, including the number of employees, Ambu has demonstrated the scale of the existing business.

§ Accounting policies Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement, provided that delivery and passing of risk to the buyer have taken place before the end of the year, and provided that the income can be measured reliably and is expected to be received.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration, exclusive of VAT and taxes collected on behalf of a third party. At the time of recognition of income, estimates are also recorded for a number of discounts. These are recognised as a reduction of gross revenue to revenue.
Based on IFRS 8 `Operating Segments' and the internal reporting to the management in their assessment of the group's results, financial position and allocation of resources, an operating segment has been identified which is concerned with the development, production and sale of medico products. This reflects the management's approach to the allocation of resources and the management of the organisation. Revenue by markets is distributed based on the purchasing country.

! Material accounting estimates
Sales discounts Sales discounts are offset against Trade receivables and primarily concern sales in the USA. Distributor discounts in the US market are subject to estimation uncertainty as the actual discount is not determined until the distributor's sale to the end-customer (hospitals, clinics etc.). Sales discounts are the difference between the price agreed with the end-customer and the distributor's list price. Sales discounts are calculated on the basis of a combination of previous experience and sales data from distributors. Sales discounts total DKK 51m (2014/15: DKK 76m).

2.3 Share-based payment

The Board of Directors is authorised by the annual general meeting to allocate share options (to the Executive Board and the Executive Management Team) and warrants (to a broad circle of middle managers etc.) and in accordance with the group's guidelines on incentive pay. Each option entitles the holder to buy an existing Class B share in Ambu A/S. A warrant entitles the holder to buy a newly issued Class B share in Ambu A/S. The vesting period of all schemes is three years from the date of allocation, after which the exercise period runs for three years. For the 2011 and 2012 warrant schemes, however, the exercise period runs for two years.
The overview shows the assumptions for allocated schemes that had not been fully exercised at the beginning of the financial year. A detailed explanation of each scheme is provided at the bottom of the note.

2.3 Share-based payment (continued)
Below is a description of schemes which had not been fully exercised at the beginning of the financial year.
1. Share option scheme (Executive Board) In October 2009, CEO Lars Marcher was awarded a total of 756,000 share options, which were allocated successively over a period of three years by one-third each year. The share options were allocated for the first time on 1 October 2009. The share options can be exercised for a period starting three years after the respective share options have been allocated and ending six years after the share options have been allocated. The first subscheme entitles the holder to buy one Class B share of DKK 20.94, with the price of other subschemes increasing by 8.0% p.a.
2., 3., 4. Share option scheme (Executive Management Team) In February 2013, the Executive Management Team was allocated a total of 1,225,590 share options (of which 811,804 are reserved for the Executive Board), which will be allocated successively over a period of three years provided that specific financial targets are achieved. The annual targets are determined by the Board of Directors and published in the annual report prior to the vesting year. The first subscheme entitles the holder to buy one Class B share of DKK 43.20, with the price of other subschemes increasing by 8.0% p.a. The financial targets were achieved in full for FY 2012/13, and based on this, 346,184 options were allocated, 229,304 of which went to the Executive Board. The financial targets were achieved in full for FY 2013/14, and based on this, 403,588 options were allocated, 267,328 of which went to the Executive Board. The financial targets were partially achieved for FY 2014/15, and based on this, 470,778 options were allocated, 315,172 of which went to the Executive Board.
5. Share option scheme (Executive Management Team) In November 2015, a total of 289,708 share options were allocated to the Executive Management Team (233,922 of which are reserved for the Executive Board). The share options will be allocated successively over a period of three years, provided that specific financial targets are achieved. The annual targets are determined by the Board of Directors and announced in the annual report for the coming year. The first subscheme entitles the holder to buy one Class B share of DKK 196.30, with the price of other subschemes increasing by 8.0% p.a. The financial targets were achieved in full for FY 2015/16, and based on this, 77,134 options are allocated to the Executive Board, while 33,788 options are allocated to the three other members of the Executive Management Team.
6., 7., 8., 9., 10. Warrant scheme (broad circle of middle managers etc. ) Warrant schemes were established in April 2011, April 2012, December 2013, December 2014 and November 2015. The purpose of the warrant schemes is to promote the creation of value in Ambu by achieving the company's strategic objectives and creating identical interests among the participants in the warrant schemes and the company's shareholders. The warrant schemes established in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 comprised 49, 69, 52, 22 and 46 senior employees in Denmark and abroad. Under all warrant schemes, each warrant entitles the holder to buy one Class B share with a nominal value of DKK 2.50 at a price of 40.13 under the 2011 scheme, at a price of 39,50 under the 2012 scheme, at a price of 66.30 under the 2013 scheme, at a price of 115.30 under the 2014 scheme and at a price of 196.30 under the 2015 scheme.Warrants under the 2015 scheme are allocated on the condition that specific financial targets are achieved. These targets are determined by the Board of Directors and published in the 2014/15 annual report. The total number of warrants allocated under the 2011 scheme was 444,000, 507,600 under the 2012 scheme, 400,000 under the 2013 scheme, 400,000 under the 2014 scheme and 154,000 under the 2015 scheme, corresponding to 0.9%, 1.1%, 0.8%, 0.8% and 0.3% of Ambu's share capital. The financial targets were achieved in full for FY 2015/16, and based on this, 153,000 warrants will be finally allocated.
§ Accounting policies The group's share-based payment has been treated in accordance with the rules on equity-based schemes where the fair value of the allocated schemes at the time of allocation is calculated according to the Black-Scholes model. This value is expensed over the vesting period for each of the respective schemes and is taken to equity. On recognition of the fair value during the vesting period, account is taken of the number of employees who are expected to obtain a final right to the schemes, including the conditions to which the allocation is subject. This estimate is reassessed at the end of a period so that only the number of rights expected to be allocated are recognised.

2.7 Financial risks from operating activities

Foreign currency risk s The largest part of Ambu's revenue, production costs and capacity costs is invoiced and paid in foreign currencies, and all assets and liabilities in the subsidiaries' balance sheets are denominated in foreign currency. As a consequence, fluctuations in these exchange rates against DKK might impact Ambu's financial position and results. The most important exchange rates are USD, MYR, CNY and GBP (collectively referred to as `main currencies').

Sensitivity analysis The following table shows the impact on the group in the event of a 10% fluctuation in the main exchange rates relative to the recognised financial instruments. The development of 10% constitutes the management's assessment of a realistic exchange rate development within the main currencies. The financial instruments comprised by the sensitivity analysis include the group's trade receivables, cash, short-term and long-term payables, trade payables and forward exchange contracts.

Hedging of expected future transactions In order to hedge future expected net cash flows for purchasing silver for the production, the group has entered into a derivative financial instrument which hedges the purchase price of silver throughout 2016/17. Interest rate swaps have been entered into in order to hedge a variable interest element in leased domicile.

Hedging of currency development A currency swap has been entered into under which Ambu pays USD 40m and receives an agreed amount in DKK. The swap was entered into for the purpose of hedging cash flows from the US business on later repayment of the bond loan.

§ Accounting policies The tax for the year, which consists of current tax and changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement with the portion attributable to the profit or loss for the year, and in equity with the portion attributable to amounts recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Tax is provided on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates applicable in the individual countries.

§ Accounting policies Deferred tax assets are assessed on an annual basis and are only recognised to the extent that such assets are likely to be used.
Deferred tax is measured under the balance-sheet liability method on the basis of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences resulting from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised under other non-current assets at the expected usable value, either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity.
Adjustment is made of deferred tax in relation to eliminations made as regards unrealised intercompany profits and losses.
Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the taxation rules and tax rates which, pursuant to the legislation in force at the balance sheet date, will apply in the individual countries at the time when the deferred tax is expected to become payable as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax is calculated on share-based payment to the extent that the individual scheme is tax-deductible for the group. Deferred tax is calculated as the difference between the value of the share-based payment at the time of allocation and the fair value, whichever is the higher. Deferred tax assets from share-based payment schemes are recognised proportionately over the vesting period.

! Material accounting estimates At the end of September 2016, the company recognised a tax loss and other timing differences of DKK 89m (2015: DKK 67m) stemming from the US operating activities. Based on the management's expectations for the future and approved budgets, the value of these tax losses and timing differences has been recognised at DKK 41m (2015: DKK 21m).
In the period prior to the acquisition on 28 September 2016, ETView had built up a tax loss stemming from operating activities in Israel. This loss totals DKK 24m, which Ambu will be able to set off against future taxable income from Israel. The management has estimated the value of this asset to be DKK 0m.
As at 30 September 2016, the unrecognised tax asset totalled DKK 72m (2015: DKK 45m).

Section 3: Invested capital and working capital

This section consists of explanatory notes relating to Ambu's total investments of DKK 239m, including development projects, production capacity and the acquisition of ETView Medical Ltd. The section also contains notes describing the working capital of DKK 521m at the end of the financial year.

Investments for the year are relatively high relative to previous years ­ primarily as a result of the acquisition of IP relating to breathing circuits as well as the acquisition of ETView Medical Ltd.

Ambu is working continuously to optimise inventories through production planning and the reduction of safety stocks. However, the physical location of our factories in Asia does entail transport times of up to eight weeks from the factories to the regional warehouses in Europe and the USA. A significant proportion of inventories is therefore in transit at any one time and thus not available for sale.

Trade receivables had fallen by 12% from DKK 473m to DKK 418m at the end of September 2016. This has been achieved concurrently with reported growth of 10% for the year. At the same time, debtor days were reduced from 82 to 67.

3.1 Intangible assets (continued)

§ Accounting policies On initial recognition, goodwill is recognised at cost in the balance sheet as described under `Business combinations'. Subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised.

At the time of acquisition, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the business combination; however, not to a lower level than the lower of segment level and the level on which goodwill is monitored as part of the internal financial management. The management has identified an operating segment to which goodwill is allocated.

Acquired technologies, trademarks and customer relations primarily comprise identified technologies.

Development projects that are clearly defined and identifiable and where the technical utilisation degree, sufficient resources and a potential future market or scope for use in the company can be proven, and where the company intends to produce, market or use the project, are recognised as intangible assets where the cost of the project can be calculated reliably and there is sufficient certainty that the future earnings or the net selling price can cover the production costs, selling and distribution costs as well as management and administrative expenses. Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Recognised development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost comprises salaries and other external expenses, e.g. consultancy fees, travel expenses etc., which are directly attributable to the group's development activities.

Upon completion of the development activity, development projects are amortised according to the straight-line method over the estimated useful life as from the time when the asset is ready for use. The basis of amortisation is reduced by impairment losses, if any.

Rights in the form of distribution rights and licences etc. are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Rights are amortised according to the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining term of the agreement and the useful lives of the assets.

Other intangible assets, including intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Other intangible assets are amortised according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets.

Intangible assets are amortised according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets/components as follows:

Acquired technologies, trademarks and customer relations Completed development projects Rights Goodwill is not amortised.

5-15 years 5 years
5-20 years

! Material accounting estimates Intangible assets identified in connection with the acquisition of enterprises When applying the purchase method in connection with the acquisition of enterprises, the management makes material estimates and assessments. On 28 September 2016, Ambu acquired the entire share capital in ETView Medical Ltd. at a price of DKK 90m, and on 15 February 2013, Ambu acquired the entire share capital in King Systems Corp. at a price of DKK 813m.
In connection with the acquisition of ETView Medical Ltd., the management identified technologies worth DKK 99m.In connection with the acquisition of King Systems Corp., intangible assets of DKK 131m were identified: technologies (DKK 105m), trademarks (DKK 18m), customer relations (DKK 5m) and order book (DKK 3m).
All identified intangible assets have finite useful lives and will therefore affect EBIT negatively until the fair value, calculated at the date of the acquisition, is fully amortised.
Useful lives of intangible assets The assessment of the useful lives of identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of enterprises is subject to material estimates where the assessments made are based on the management's experience as well as advice from specialists. The useful lives of completed development projects are estimated on completion of the project at which time amortisation of cost begins. The useful life of the asset may subsequently be changed if the management believes that the original assumptions on which the useful life and any residual value are based have changed significantly.

Notes on the consolidated financial statements ­ Section 3
3.2 Impairment test
Goodwill The Ambu group is managed as one single unit, for which reason the management monitors goodwill as a whole. Consequently, the impairment test is based on the Ambu group's total cash flows. The market value of Ambu A/S's shares based on the traded price for the shares on NASDAQ Copenhagen is far higher than the booked equity. Therefore, the management has concluded that the net selling price calculated on the basis of a level 1 fair value measurement proves that there is no indication of impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets Continuous impairment tests are made in respect of both completed development projects and development projects in progress where the management compares the estimated future net cash flows with the carrying amount of the asset. The impairment tests made have not resulted in any indication of impairment.
§ Accounting policies The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated and is impaired to the recoverable amount in the income statement if the carrying amount is higher. Impairment of goodwill is recognised as a separate item in the income statement. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, the first time being by the end of the year of acquisition. Development projects in progress are also subject to an annual impairment test. The carrying amount of other non-current assets is assessed on an annual basis to establish whether there is any indication of impairment. When such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less expected selling costs and the value in use. The value in use is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset or the cash-generating unit in which the asset is included. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement under production costs, selling and distribution costs, development costs as well as management and administrative expenses, as appropriate. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed in so far as the assumptions and estimates on the basis of which the impairment is made have been changed. Impairments are only reversed in so far as the new carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount of the asset after amortisation, had the asset not been impaired.
! Material accounting estimates Impairment tests require material estimates of how future events will affect the value of development projects. The value of completed development projects amounts to DKK 101m (2015: DKK 61m), while the value of development projects in progress is DKK 41m (2015: DKK 58m). For other intangible assets with finite useful lives, the management assesses whether there are internal or external indications of impairment. If there are indications of impairment, an impairment test is carried out, and the tested intangible asset is written down to the lower of recoverable amount and carrying amount.

DKKm

§ Accounting policies Land and buildings, including investment property, plant and machinery and other plant, fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Cost comprises the acquisition price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is ready for use. The cost of self-constructed assets comprises direct and indirect costs of materials, components, subsuppliers, wages and salaries. The cost of a total asset is divided into separate elements which are depreciated individually when the useful lives of the individual elements differ.

For assets held under finance leases, cost is calculated at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of the future minimum lease payments. For calculating the present value, the internal rate of interest of the lease is used as the discount rate or an approximation of this value.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings, including investment property Building installations Plant and machinery Other plant, fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment Land is not depreciated.

10-25 years 10 years
2-10 years 3-5 years

The basis of depreciation is calculated in consideration of the residual value of the asset and is reduced by impairment, if any. The residual value is fixed at the date of acquisition and is subject to annual review. When the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, depreciation will no longer take place.
In connection with changes in the depreciation period or the residual value, the effect of depreciation is recognised in future as a change in the accounting estimate.

Depreciation is recognised in the income statement under production costs, selling and distribution costs, development costs or management and administrative expenses, respectively, in so far as depreciation is not included in the cost of self-constructed assets.

§ Accounting policies Inventories are measured at the lower of cost calculated according to the FIFO principle and net realisable value. The net realisable value is calculated as the selling price less costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
The cost of goods for resale as well as commodities and consumables comprises the acquisition price plus delivery costs.
The cost of manufactured goods and work in progress comprises the cost of commodities, consumables, direct labour costs and production overheads in the form of logistics and planning costs, production management as well as expenses for production facilities and equipment etc.

! Material accounting estimates Production overheads with the value of inventories added are calculated on the basis of a standard cost method, which is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure valid assumptions. Changes in the assessments made will affect the valuation of inventories and operating profit (EBIT). The carrying amount of capitalised production overheads totals DKK 43m (2014/15: DKK 45m).

Trade receivables had fallen by 12% from DKK 473m to DKK 418m at the end of September 2016. This has been achieved concurrently with reported growth of 10% for the year. The development of trade receivables is attributable to the management's increased focus on debt collection through monitoring and improved business processes in 2015/16.

Credit risk s A share of the trade receivables is overdue by more than three months. Reference is made to the detailed description of credit risks in note 4.1 where the management regards the risk of bad debts as being low.

Description of the acquired activities ETView Medical Ltd. is located in Misgav, Israel, and produces single-use airway tubes with integrated camera through strategic suppliers. The airway tubes are sold globally and mostly through distributors; however, at the acquisition date, ETView was directly represented on the US market through its own sales staff. The acquisition of ETView strengthens Ambu's portfolio of visualisation products.
The most important asset is identified acquired technologies consisting of a patented visualisation technology platform. The fair value measurement is based on future sales budgets and is thus subject to some estimation uncertainty. Technologies are valued in accordance with the Relief from Royalty method and is amortised over the estimated useful life of 15 years.
The statement of the pre-acquisition balance sheet for ETView still remains to be completed at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill Goodwill is recognised at the amount by which the calculated purchase price exceeds the identifiable net assets. The calculated goodwill can be ascribed to employee know-how. The recognised goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Information about the acquired enterprise In the period from the acquisition date and until 30 September 2016, ETView has contributed DKK 0m to consolidated revenue and DKK 0m to the operating profit for the year. Had ETView been consolidated as from 1 October 2015, ETView would have contributed DKK 15m to revenue and DKK -16m to the operating profit. The stated figures have been calculated before the effect of purchase price allocations.

Section 4:
Financial risk management, capital structure and net financials
This section provides an overview of Ambu's capital structure, net financials as well as a description of the measures taken by management to prevent and reduce the financial risks to which Ambu is exposed.
Helped by a 38% increase in EBITDA, Ambu realised the expected debt multiple of 2.1 most recently announced.
In FY 2015/16, acquisitions were made of enterprises and technology totalling DKK 155m, which has increased the debt multiple by 0.4. Since arranging the bond loan in 2013, Ambu has been working to reduce the gearing to approx. 1.75, and this is still the intention.
At the end of September 2016, interest-bearing debt corresponds to a weighted cost of capital of 2.8%, which is predominantly fixed-interest. A significant part of the cost of capital pertains to the company's corporate bonds, with a nominal value of DKK 700.5m, maturing in March 2018.
Net financials are reduced by DKK 9m as a result of non-market value adjustments and other non-cash items. The underlying cash interest payment is unchanged, and in the region of DKK 30m.

4.1 Financial risk management

As an international player, Ambu is exposed to certain market risks, including fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates as well as the development in commodity prices.

Foreign currency risk s Fluctuations in foreign currency and foreign currency's impact on the group's financial objectives are continuously monitored by Ambu's Corporate Accounting department. See note 2.7 for further information about foreign currency risks.

Interest rate risk s It is group policy to hedge material interest rate risks in respect of the group's loans. Hedging is normally done by concluding interest rate swaps with floating-rate loans being converted to fixed-rate loans.

The main part of the group's debt is arranged as fixed-rate loans through the issue of bonds. A probable change in interest rates will thus not have a significant effect on the income statement or equity.
Commodity prices The world market price of silver can impact electrode production costs significantly. Management therefore hedges the silver purchases for the year. The hedging takes the form of derivatives hedging the expected purchases for the year. Reference is made to note 2.7 regarding the fair value of the hedge.
Liquidity risk s Financing and sufficient liquidity are fundamental to Ambu's continued operation and growth. Liquidity is managed centrally from Ambu's head office. No cash-pool solutions are applied, but intercompany loans have been extended by Ambu A/S to a few subsidiaries.
The objective of the cash management is to ensure a return for the shareholders and to ensure that adequate and flexible cash resources are being maintained, thus enabling Ambu to honour its current obligations, such as repaying loans and settling other liabilities.
The liquidity risk is countered by a consistent focus on budgeted and realised cash flow.
In March 2013, Ambu A/S issued bonds at a nominal value of DKK 700.5m. The bonds carry a fixed interest rate of 3.375% and a yield to maturity of 3.506%. The bonds must be repaid in full in March 2018. The fair value of the bonds issued was DKK 724m as at 30 September 2016 (2014/15: DKK 729m). The debt can be attributed to level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as the bond is listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen.
With the acquisition of King Systems in 2013, the net interest-bearing debt rose significantly, increasing the focus on cash management. The debt, which was arranged through the bond issue in 2013, is serviced by way of the ordinary operating income. Plans are to partially refinance the debt at maturity in 2018.

The cash resources consist of unutilised credit facilities in banks which are specified below:

Unutilised credit facilities

30.09.15 197

Credit risk s Ambu is exposed to credit risks in respect of bank deposits and trade receivables. The maximum credit risk corresponds to the carrying
Cash is not deemed to be subject to any credit risks as the company's primary banks are SIFI banks.
Outstanding trade receivables are monitored on a regular basis in accordance with the company's debtor policy, which is based on concrete debtor assessments of private customers. Public-sector customers are an important part of the company's receivables, and it is believed that no debtor risks are associated with public-sector customers. In the event of uncertainty as to a customer's ability or willingness to pay a receivable and where it is deemed that the claim is subject to risk, a write-down is made to hedge such risk.
Provisions are made for bad debts on the basis of an individual assessment of the risk. No material changes were made during the financial year with regard to provisions for bad debts nor were any material losses ascertained.

§ Accounting policies Debt to credit institutions etc. is recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the `effective rate of interest method' so that the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised under financial expenses in the income statement for the duration of the loan term.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised as from the transaction date and are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated on the basis of current market data as well as accepted valuation methods.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and fulfilling the criteria for hedging the fair value of a recognised asset or liability are recognised in the income statement together with any changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability as regards the hedged part.

Changes in the part of the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and fulfilling the criteria for hedging future cash flows, and which, in an efficient manner, hedge changes in the value of the hedged item, are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate reserve for hedging transactions under equity until the hedged transaction is realised. At this time, gains or losses on such hedging transactions are transferred from equity and recognised under the same item as the hedged item. When hedging proceeds from future borrowings, the gains or losses on hedging transactions are, however, transferred from other comprehensive income over the term of the loan.

For derivative financial instruments which do not fulfil the conditions for treatment as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement.
The capitalised remaining lease obligation in respect of finance leases, measured at amortised cost, is also recognised under financial liabilities.

Other liabilities are measured at amortised cost, including corporate bonds issued.

4.5 Share capital and treasury shares

Share capital Ambu's share capital is divided into two share classes of DKK 2.50 per share each. A Class A share carries 10 votes per share, while a Class B share carries one vote per share. There is no difference between the economic rights pertaining to the individual share classes. All shares are paid in full.

The Board of Directors' proposal for a 1:4 share split was approved by Ambu's shareholders on 17 December 2014. In FY 2015/16, several capital increases were implemented in connection with the exercise by employees of warrants issued in 2011 and 2012. In consequence hereof, Ambu's share capital was increased by a nominal amount of DKK 272,000 through the issue of 108,800 Class B shares at a weighted price of 39.66.

§ Accounting policies Earnings per share are presented as both earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share are calculated as the net profit for the year divided by the average number of outstanding shares. Diluted earnings per share are calculated as the net profit for the year divided by the sum of the average number of outstanding shares including the diluting effect of outstanding share options and warrants that are `in the money'. The diluting effect of share options and warrants that are `in the money' is calculated as the difference between the number of shares that could be acquired at fair value for the proceeds from the exercise of the share options and allocated warrants.

During the financial year, Ambu settled provisions in the amount of DKK 4m (2014/15: DKK 21m) in respect of earn-out and technology purchases.

Reversal of unused amounts concerns a change in the assumptions underlying the value-in-use calculation of the purchase price payable in connection with technology acquisitions in the amount of DKK 12m.The value adjustment for the year, which can be ascribed to the shorter discount period, amounts to DKK 4m (2014/15: The effect of the shorter discount period amounted to DKK 7m, to which should be added remeasurement of the earn-out agreement of DKK -25m).
As at the balance sheet date, provisions concerned the earn-out agreement relating to the acquisitions of First Water Heathcote Ltd. as well as debt deriving from the purchase of pain pump and other technology.

§ Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when the group, as a result of an event having occurred before or on the balance sheet date, has incurred a legal or actual liability, and it is probable that economic benefits will flow from the group in order to settle the liability. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, provisions are discounted using a before-tax discount rate. When applying a discount rate, the change in provisions due to the timing is recognised as a finance cost.

Operating leases have been entered into with Danish and foreign lease companies and with an original lease period of up to 15 years, being non-terminable on the part of both parties. The leases are normally renewable for a minimum of one year at a time, and the lease payments are normally fixed throughout the term of the lease. The lease commitment has been calculated on the basis of the payments falling due during the term of the lease. The property leased in Denmark carries an option to purchase. The option to purchase is based on the estimated fair value at the time of its exercise.
