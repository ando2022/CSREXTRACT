Welcome to BASF
Our integrated corporate report combines financial and sustainability reporting to inform shareholders, employees and the interested public about the 2016 business year.

Chemistry for a sustainable future
Our innovations contribute to a sustainable future. We support the United Nations in the implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which create the framework for sustainable business practices at the economic, social and environmental levels. In drafting these development goals, the United Nations worked together with nongovernmental organizations, international trade associations, employee representatives, scientists, policymakers and industry. BASF was actively involved in the development of the SDGs as a member of working groups.
On the following pages, we share how BASF contributes to the SDGs: with responsible production, solutions for clean water, products for sustainable agriculture and to combat h unger, and with contributions to infrastructure, industry and innovation.
Cover photo and page 1: We drive digital transformation under the banner "BASF 4.0": In plants at the Ludwigshafen site, e mployees can access information at any time using s pecial tablets and QR codes.

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
Our contribution to a sustainable future

PRODUCTION
The BASF Verbund's strengths lie in highly efficient, innovative value chains that extend from basic chemicals right through to high-value-added products. We use resource-saving processes to make products that create value for our customers and the environment.

Sustainable, improved production
Greater supply security combined with more efficient and environmentally friendly production: BASF switched over its production process for the monomer acrylamide to a modern enzyme-based process. Acrylamide is used for the production of water-soluble flocculation aids in wastewater treatment and papermaking, as well as mineral p rocessing and enhanced oil recovery. The bio catalytic production method results in less waste than the copper catalysis previously used. The p rocess takes place at room temperature and under normal atmospheric conditions, resulting in energy savings and greater environmental compatibility. It also generates fewer by-products. BASF has been producing bio-acrylamide in Suffolk, Virginia, since 2014 and started up a new bio-acrylamide plant in Bradford, England, in 2016. A third plant is being built in Asia and should start up in 2017. With three state-of-the-art production facilities located directly in key markets, BASF is able to quickly and sustainably meet regional d emand.
F or more on bio-polyacrylamide, see basf.com/bioacrylamide

Milestone: To bolster its worldwide polyacrylamide production network, BASF started up the new world-scale production plant for bio-acrylamide in Bradford, England.

Production in North America: BASF has been producing bio-acrylamide in Suffolk, Virginia, since 2014.

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Naturally lighter
"Weight savings" is a key term in modern automotive engineering, as lighter vehicle components reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions for the end customer. To produce lightweight, innovative auto parts made from environmentally friendly substances, manufacturers need the right materials from the supplier industry. Such as BASF's binding agent Acrodur®: The acrylic resin can be processed in a simple and e specially environmentally friendly manner; the only by-product generated is water. Acrodur® is used, for e xample, in collaboration with partners to create a new vehicle roof frame u sing renewable hemp. The natural fiber construction is strengthened with Acrodur®, making the roof frame up to 40% lighter compared with regular steel components.
F or more information, see basf.com/nonwovens

Lighter weight: The binding agent Acrodur® 950 L provides the strength and heat-resistance needed in the world's first vehicle roof frame made entirely of natural fibers.

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

WATER
Water is a valuable resource. It needs to be handled responsibly, and new methods of wastewater treatment are in demand. Two examples show how BASF helps.
Clean water: Dr. Kevin McPeak is a scientist in residence at the BASF Sustainable Living Laboratory at Louisiana State University. He researches portable filtration and disinfection systems for drinking water ­ harnessing visible sunlight.

Purified by the sun
Clean water is essential for our health. We need new and simple solutions to produce safe drinking water ­ especially in developing countries where traditional, energy-intensive methods of water treatment are difficult to put into practice. At the United States' Louisiana State University, new ideas have room to develop: As the major sponsor, BASF provided the university's College of Engineering with $1 million to help construct the BASF Sustainable Living Laboratory. The laboratory, in operation since fall 2016, focuses on researching sustainable solutions for global challenges. Dr. Kevin McPeak is the lab's first scientist in residence. He and his team are working on portable filtration and disinfection systems for drinking water. "We are investigating light-driven oxidation processes that safely and effectively inactivate pathogens," McPeak explains. Instead of the ultraviolet light used in traditional methods for sun-supported water treatment, he harnesses visible sunlight. Ultraviolet light makes up a mere 5% of the solar spectrum. By contrast, visible light accounts for more than 40% of the spectrum, which means that McPeak harnesses several times as much energy than traditional methods. This, in turn, allows for quicker and more effective disinfection. With his research, McPeak wants to create a simple and inexpensive solution for developing countries to transform polluted water into drinking water.

Largest water treatment plant on the Rhine: The BASF wastewater treatment plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, purifies almost 100 million cubic meters of the company's production water every year. Even wastewater from the surrounding towns and communities is purified.

A better energy footprint: Dr. Peter Schmittel is manager of the wastewater treatment plant. He and his team work on improving the facility's energy footprint ­ with great success.

Tiny helpers, big impact
BASF's wastewater treatment plant is one of the largest in Europe. It purifies nearly 100 million cubic meters of wastewater from BASF's production each year, in addition to another 20 million cubic meters of wastewater from the German towns of Ludwigshafen, Frankenthal and Bobenheim-Roxheim. The core of the plant is b iological purification: Bacteria transform polluted water into sewage sludge, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Keeping the wastewater moving and the bacteria supplied with oxygen requires a lot of energy. Without changing water volume or quality, BASF has increased the plant's energy efficiency by 28% compared with 2012 and reduced costs by around 3 million over this period. In addition, 18,000 fewer metric tons of CO2 are emitted annually. "Efficient biological p urification is the key to our success. Solid m atter is already better separated in the p recleaning phase, reducing not only the amount of pollution in the biological pools, but also the energy requirement for aeration," explains plant manager Dr. Peter Schmittel. BASF also reduced the bacteria concentration by 50%. The remaining bacteria are better supplied with o xygen, which enables them to work even more efficiently.
F or more on the water treatment plant, see basf.com/wastewater-treatment-plant

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
FOOD
In 2050, nearly ten billion people will live on Earth. Our innovative solutions for efficient and environmentally friendly agriculture and animal feed make an important contribution toward keeping people supplied with s ufficient and nourishing food.
Improved feed conversion
Sustainability is a core criterion in the development of BASF's feed additives portfolio. This means we not only e valuate additives based on their n utritional value, we also consider a dditional positive effects on animal feed and the environment. In pig and poultry feeding, the enzyme Natuphos® improves digestion of important n utrients such as p hosphorus, p roteins, calcium and zinc. The feed is more environmentally friendly, as the animals excrete less phosphorus, reducing the impact on water. Thanks to Natuphos®, the animals are also better able to utilize the energy from their food, reducing the overall feeding costs. In pig farming, adding the organic acid Amasil® lowers the pH value of the pigs' food, creating an environment that is inhospitable to harmful bacteria. The lower amount of bacteria c onsumed reduces the animals' microbial load, improving their vitality. Furthermore, Amasil® extends the food's shelf life, enabling farmers to provide their animals with the needed nutrients in high quality.
F or more on feed additives, see: animal-nutrition.basf.com
Enzymes for sustainable agriculture: The animal feed additive Natuphos® helps farmers raise healthy animals.

Knowledge on a global scale
BASF opened a new research and development center for biological crop protection and seed solutions in L imburgerhof, Germany. Together with other research sites in Brazil, Argentina, France, England, South Africa, China, Australia, the United States and Canada, Limburgerhof is part of an international network of expertise. Its goal is the global exchange of research results that have been tried and tested in different climate zones and under various local parameters. In this network, BASF researches naturally occurring organisms and cultures and their potential use in biological crop protection. This is how we pursue our goal of supplementing our classic portfolio of chemical crop protection and offering farmers an even more comprehensive product portfolio. We combine knowledge of b iological microorganism fermentation with chemical formulation expertise and d evelop new solutions for better seed treatment. Farmers then profit from seeds that provide plants with all-around p rotection from the very beginning. S owing is simulated and optimized in order to provide farmers with the best p ossible application and handling.
F or more on crop protection solutions, see basf.com/agro

Networked research: The new research and development center in Limburgerhof, Germany, is part of our global network of R+D sites and testing centers for biological crop protection and seed treatment solutions.
Protected seeds: Seed treatments and refining support plants' undisturbed d evelopment from the very beginning. This later increases yields.

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

I N F R A S T R U C T U R E , I N D U S T R Y, I N N O VAT I O N
Infrastructure, industry and innovation are three important pillars of sustainable development. While infrastructure provides the basic foundation for all business processes, innovations ­ such as in the field of digitalization ­ expand our technological possibilities.

Smart Manufacturing: The steam cracker in Ludwigshafen has state-of-the-art information and automation technology at its disposal.

Driving digital transformation
The BASF 4.0 project team is evaluating possibilities for more intensive use of digital technologies and business models, and drives the digital trans formation of BASF. Under the banner "Smart Manufacturing," BASF implements digital technologies and applications in its plants with the goal of making production more efficient and even safer. This includes the "predictive maintenance" approach. A model-based analysis of the data can, for example, better predict the optimal point in time for maintenance measures, reducing unscheduled repairs and shutdowns and optimizing coordination between maintenance and production processes. The steam cracker ­ the heart of production in Ludwigshafen ­ already uses predictive maintenance through the application of state-of-the-art information and automation technology. S everal thousand sensors track process data, like pressure and temperature, around the clock in order to monitor and optimally direct the plant. Another Smart Manufacturing project is "Augmented R eality." Plant employees are supported in their work with industry-specific tablet devices that p rovide access at any time to digital information. Working processes are made more transparent and efficient.

Digital and mobile: Special tablet devices give plant employees access to information at any time.

CHEMISTRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Delhi Metro: BASF developed customized concrete waterproofing solutions for the subway system of the Delhi, India, metropolitan region.

Expertise for big visions
Delhi is one of the largest cities in the world. The pulsing metropolis of over 16 million people is one of the most important centers of commerce and trade in India. After the expansion of its metro, over 270 stations along approximately 330 kilometers of rail will run under the surface of the city. To date, only the cities of London, Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing boast larger subway networks. Construction projects on this scale would hardly be possible without innovative and robust construction materials. For the expansion of the Delhi Metro, the BASF team in India won the project tender with their customized concept proposal, including the use of BASF waterproofing solutions for concrete. BASF's Master Builders Solutions line of concrete solutions are currently used in underground transport systems all over the world, such as in China, Singapore, the United States and Poland. Railway tunnel construction is another area that uses BASF's construction chemicals solutions. In Switzerland, for example, concrete additives and cement-based injections for waterproofing were employed in building the world's longest rail tunnel, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, and its feeder, the Ceneri Base Tunnel. Especially in megaprojects, the high performance of BASF construction chemicals in sometimes extremely demanding conditions is an important distinguishing feature.

How we create value

BASF Report 2016

BASF's success is supported by both financial and nonfinancial value drivers. We want to understand how these interact, and derive targeted measures for increasing the positive impact of our actions and further minimizing the negative effects. This intention forms the basis of our integrated reporting.
The following overview provides examples of how we create value for our company, the environment and society. It is modeled on the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). Both financial and nonfinancial value drivers ­ such as environmental, production-related, personnel and knowledge-based factors, along with aspects of society and partnerships ­ form the foundation of our actions. Through our business model these inputs are transformed into various outputs ­ the results o f our actions.

About This Report 3

Content and structure

Requirements and topics

 As an integrated report, the BASF Report also serves as a progress report in terms of U.N. Global Compact
 Sustainability reporting follows Global Reporting Initiative's G4 "comprehensive" international guidelines
The BASF Report combines the major financial and non- financial information necessary to thoroughly evaluate our performance. We select the report's topics based on the following reporting principles: materiality, sustainability context, completeness, balance, and stakeholder inclusion. In addition to our integrated report, we publish further information online. Links to this supplementary information are provided in each chapter.
Our sustainability reporting has been based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards since 2003 already. For the BASF Report 2016, we have chosen the GRI's "comprehensive" disclosure criteria.
In addition, we served as a pilot enterprise in the development of the framework for integrated reporting of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). Following this pilot phase, we have been active in the IR Business Network since 2014 in order to discuss our experience with other stake holders and at the same time receive inspiration for enhancing our reporting. This report addresses elements of the IIRC framework by, for example, using graphics to illustrate how we create value or demonstrate the relationships between financial and nonfinancial performance in the chapters for the segments. The information in the BASF Report 2016 also serves as a progress report on BASF's implementation of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and takes into consideration the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership of the Global Compact LEAD platform.
The GRI and Global Compact Index can be found in the online report, providing information on GRI indicators and topics relevant to the Global Compact principles.

 Financial reporting according to International F inancial Reporting Standards, German Commercial Code and German Accounting Standards
 Sustainability reporting focused on material topics
The information on the financial position and performance of the BASF Group is based on the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and, where applicable, the German Commercial Code, the German Accounting Standards (GAS), and the guidelines on alternative performance measures from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Internal control mechanisms ensure the reliability of the information presented in this report. BASF's management confirmed the effectiveness of the internal control measures and compliance with the regulations for financial reporting.

To Our Shareholders 7
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors

Dear Shareholder,
In 2016, we achieved the goals we set for ourselves for growth and earnings. We successfully grew in the chemicals business and further improved profitability. It was foreseeable that earnings in Oil & Gas would not match the previous year's level. The oil price declined further ­ by around 15%, to an average of $44 per barrel for Brent crude in 2016. Furthermore, we had divested our gas trading and storage business in the third quarter of 2015. As a result, BASF Group's EBIT before special items of 6.3 billion was slightly lower overall, down by 6% versus the previous year. As expected, sales declined considerably, by 18% to 57.6 billion.
2016 also painfully demonstrated to us that, despite all our caution and protective measures, risks in the chemical industry cannot be ruled out. In October an accident occurred during maintenance work on a pipeline at the Ludwigshafen site. An explosion resulted in the deaths of four people. Our sympathy is with their families and friends. We are doing everything we can to fully investigate the accident and we will continue to be open and transparent in reporting the findings. If there are ways of further improving our safety, we will pursue them.
The BASF team worked hard to quickly implement solutions to the initial major disturbances to the logistics supplying the site. As a result, the economic consequences are considerably smaller than had been expected in the immediate aftermath of the accident. This was an impressive demonstration of the strength of the BASF team. And for this as well, I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to all employees on behalf of the Board of Executive Directors, especially since 2016 was also a challenging business year.
2016 got off to a weak start with the oil price at times dipping below $30 per barrel for Brent crude. Our customers were feeling uncertain and were hesitant to place orders. In the first quarter we did not achieve any volume growth. Throughout the rest of the year the impact of our strict spending and cost-discipline measures continually increased. Our excellence program DrivE also delivered the anticipated contributions. Both of these factors played a role in the positive earnings momentum.
As the year progressed, we were able to increase BASF's growth. Our sales volumes rose from quarter to quarter. Particularly in Asia, we continuously increased our sales volumes in the chemicals business and grew strongly. This shows that the high investments we made in research and development and new production capacity in recent years are paying off. The Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments, where we provide our customers with tailor-made solutions for their applications, contributed in particular to this. In both of these segments we significantly improved our profitability, even more than we had expected one year ago. In the Chemicals segment, our earnings nearly matched the previous year's level and were thus slightly better than expected. Despite considerable price erosion for many products as a result of lower raw material prices, we were able to keep margins stable in many cases.

8 To Our Shareholders
Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors 

BASF Report 2016

"The chemicals business and our crop protection business successfully contributed to considerable improvement in EBIT after cost of capital."
"We have bundled, focused and accelerated our digitalization activities under the name BASF 4.0."

Our crop protection business performed moderately well in a difficult market environment. Volumes were below the prior-year level, but we managed to keep EBIT before special items stable thanks to strict cost management ­ we consider this a solid result compared with other industry players.
In the Oil & Gas business we made dramatic adjustments to our costs and expenditures in response to the changing market conditions. As expected, sales and earnings in the segment were significantly below the previous year's level. An important development was our increased production of oil and gas in 2016. Following the sale of our gas trading business we are concentrating on the exploration and production of oil and gas.
We want to create value for our shareholders. The benchmark for this is positive EBIT after cost of capital. The considerable improvement in 2016 is especially satisfying because the chemicals business and our crop protection business successfully contributed to this. We were thus able to more than offset the price-related negative contribution from our Oil & Gas business.
As a shareholder, you deserve to appropriately share in this success. We are continuing our dividend policy and propose to raise the dividend again, by 10 cents to 3.00 per share. BASF shares thus once again offer a high dividend yield of 3.4% based on the closing share price at the end of 2016.
The BASF share price trend in 2016 reflected the earnings momentum as well as future expectations. In a volatile market environment our share price developed positively. It closed out the year at 88.31, around 25% higher than at the end of the previous year. The performance of our shares was also impressive: With dividends reinvested, the value of our shares rose by 30%, thus considerably outperforming the DAX 30 (7%), Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 (4%) and MSCI World Chemicals (11%) Indexes.
Five years ago, we introduced our "We create chemistry" strategy. It focused on growth from investments, innovation and the further development of our portfolio.
In recent years, we have increased our investments in new plants worldwide. We have thus created the conditions to enable organic growth. After a phase of high investments, especially in emerging markets, we scaled these back in 2016 as previously announced. In the coming years we plan to invest at a comparable level. We are now filling the existing capacity in our plants and we want to build on the volume growth momentum seen last year.
Innovation and sustainability ­ which are closely related ­ are key pillars of our strategy. In order to offer customized solutions to our customers in the various regions and markets, we have continuously expanded our global research and development activities. In 2016 we further developed our approach to innovation. Our researchers are working on using digital technologies even more. We are integrating digital technologies in our research processes and using data to explore new questions. We also want to make greater use of scientific models to predict the properties of chemical structures. These measures help us strengthen our long-term competitiveness and take advantage of new growth opportunities.
Digitalization will change BASF in other areas, too. We have bundled, focused and accelerated our digitalization activities under the name BASF 4.0. The digital transformation will influence the way we manage our factories in the future, how we work seamlessly with our suppliers and customers, and how we tap and develop new business opportunities and markets. This report contains examples of how we are doing this. We see digitalization as an opportunity for BASF and for our employees ­ and we will actively shape it.

Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors

We also want to continue to grow profitably with acquisitions. In 2016 we purchased Chemetall, a leading global supplier of surface treatments. Chemetall's products can, for example, protect metals from corrosion or facilitate their machining. They are used in industries such as automotive and aerospace. This business is very close to customers and perfectly complements our coatings activities. At the same time, we have divested activities that were no longer an optimal fit for our portfolio, such as the industrial coatings and polyolefin catalysts businesses, which we successfully sold.
The process of structural change in the chemical industry continues, following what appear to be the prevailing trends. BASF adheres to simple principles: Every business should achieve a leading market position if possible and be successful on its own ­ especially in comparison with its direct competitors. And each business benefits from BASF and from our Verbund ­ not only in production and logistics but also in research and development and with customers. The Verbund is and will remain the core of BASF. It demands and fosters excellence.
In 2017, we want to grow further and all segments should contribute to this. More importantly, our earnings should rise again, also in the Oil & Gas business, where we assume an average oil price of $55 per barrel of Brent crude in 2017. Business so far this year is in line with our expectations. These expectations are also based on the assumptions that economic conditions will be similar to 2016 and chemical production worldwide will rise by around 3.4%.
However, political uncertainties in particular have rarely been this high. The impact of Brexit remains unpredictable; it affects our competitiveness as well as that of our customers in our home market of Europe, where, moreover, important elections are taking place. Protectionism may seem sweet at first, but it is poison. Around the world, we are seeing a trend towards trying to create prosperity through isolation rather than cooperation. This is another reason why our strategy of producing as much as possible in the local markets is still the right approach.
In the long term, Asia will continue to be the growth driver in the global chemicals market. And China is by far the largest market. In the growth markets in particular we have systematically invested in production, research and development and sales and marketing. We can therefore offer our local customers tailor-made solutions and successfully participate in this growth.
We are cautiously optimistic for 2017. In light of the major uncertainties, we will continue our strict discipline with respect to expenditures and costs. An ongoing task is the further development of our portfolio. We will continue to drive forward the digital transformation in our research and development, in production and in the development of new business models that connect us even more closely with our customers. I can assure you that the BASF team is full of energy and drive ­ and we will prove it once again in 2017.
Yours,

"In 2017, we want to grow further and all segments should contribute to this."
"In the growth markets in particular we have systematically invested in production, research and development and sales and marketing."

Proposed dividend per share

DJSI World, CDP
BASF once again included in sustainability indexes

Stock markets in 2016 were again marked by a high level of volatility. Particularly contributing to this were fluctuating economic figures in China, crude oil prices and the referendum in the United Kingdom on E.U. membership. In this volatile environment, the BASF share rose by 24.9%, trading at 88.31 at the end of 2016. We stand by our ambitious dividend policy and will propose a dividend of 3.00 per share at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting ­ an increase of 3.4% compared with the previous year. BASF enjoys solid financing and good credit ratings.
BASF share performance
 BASF share gains 24.9% in 2016  Long-term development continues to clearly
outperform benchmark indexes
Weak economic data from the United States and China as well as turbulence in the crude oil market led to a negative start to the 2016 stock market year. Gains in oil prices, solid U.S. labor market data and better economic indicators for China led to stock market recovery during the second quarter. The uncertainty leading up to the United Kingdom's referendum on E.U. membership influenced the further course of the second quarter. Stock markets suffered considerable losses following the vote on June 23, 2016, to leave the E.U. Share prices

subsequently recovered thanks to factors such as improved Chinese economic data and the U.S. Federal Reserve's initially unchanged interest rate policy. In the fourth quarter, the extension of the European Central Bank's bond-buying program as well as hopes for a growth-promoting economic policy from the newly elected U.S. president led to a year-end rally. On December 30, 2016, Germany's benchmark index, the DAX 30, reached a year's high of 11,481 points, as did the BASF share price at 88.31. This equates to a 24.9% rise in the value of BASF shares compared with the previous year's closing price. Assuming that dividends were reinvested, BASF shares gained 30.1% in value in 2016. The BASF share thus outperformed the German and European stock markets, whose benchmark indexes DAX 30 and DJ EURO STOXX 50 gained 6.9% and 3.7% over the same period, respectively. As for the global industry indexes, DJ Chemicals increased 10.8% in 2016 and MSCI World Chemicals 11.2%.
Viewed over a five and ten-year period, the long-term performance of BASF shares still clearly surpasses these indexes. The assets of an investor who invested 1,000 in BASF shares at the end of 2006 and reinvested the dividends in additional BASF shares would have increased to 3,538 by the end of 2016. This represents an annual yield of 13.5%, placing BASF shares above the returns for the DAX 30 (5.7%), EURO STOXX 50 (0.9%) and MSCI World Chemicals (7.0%) indexes.

Proposed dividend of 3.00 per share
At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend payment of 3.00 per share. We stand by our ambitious dividend policy and plan to pay out nearly 2.8 billion to our shareholders. Based on the year-end share price for 2016, BASF shares offer a high dividend yield of 3.4%. BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the fifteen companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX 30. We aim to increase our dividend each year, or at least maintain it at the previous year's level.

Broad base of international shareholders

With over 500,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest publicly owned companies with a high free float. An analysis of the shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2016 showed that, at 18% of share capital, the United States and Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional investors. Institutional investors from Germany accounted for 11%. Shareholders from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold 11% of BASF shares, while institutional investors from the rest of Europe hold a further 17% of capital. Approxim ately 29% of the company's share capital is held by private investors, most of whom reside in Germany. BASF is therefore one of the DAX 30 companies with the largest percentage of private shareholders.

BASF a sustainable investment

Good credit ratings and solid financing

 BASF once again included in DJSI World sustainability index in 2016
 CDP again awards BASF leadership status and honors company's sustainable water management
In September 2016, BASF shares were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the sixteenth year in succession. As one of the most well-known sustainability indexes, the DJSI World represents the top 10% of the 2,500 largest companies in the S&P Global Broad Market Index based on economic, environmental and social criteria.
BASF has participated in CDP's environmental data repor ting program since 2004. The CDP represents more than 820 institutional investors who manage over $100 trillion in assets. The CDP's indexes serve as assessment tools for investors. In 2016, BASF achieved a rating of A- and gained leadership status once again. In an analysis of the largest 350 enterprises in Germany, Austria and Switzerland by market capitalization, CDP named BASF among five companies whose efforts have contributed significantly to a reduction in environmental emissions. In addition, BASF was one of 24 companies in 2016, out of a total of 607 assessed by CDP, to receive the top grade of "A" for sustainable water management, putting it among the world's leading enterprises in this area.
For more on the key sustainability indexes, see basf.com/sustainabilityindexes For more on energy and climate protection, see page 103 onward

Rated "A1/P-1/outlook stable" by Moody's and "A/A-1/outlook stable" by Standard & Poor's, BASF enjoys good credit ratings, especially compared with competitors in the chemical industry. Rating agency Scope has also been evaluating our creditworthiness since September 2016. It rates BASF at "A/S-1/outlook stable."
At the end of 2016, the financial indebtedness of the BASF Group was 16.3 billion. Liquid funds including marketable securities amounted to 1.9 billion. The average maturity of our financial indebtedness was 5.6 years. The company's medium to long-term debt financing is predominantly based on corporate bonds with a balanced maturity profile. In 2016, BASF issued several bonds to finance, among other things, the acquisition of Chemetall. For short-term debt financing, BASF SE has a commercial paper program with an issuing volume of up to $12.5 billion. As backup for the commercial paper program, there are committed, broadly syndicated credit lines of 6 billion available; these are not being used at this time.
For more on financial indebtedness and maturities, see page 56 onward and the Notes from page 204 onward
Analysts' recommendations
Around 30 financial analysts regularly publish studies on BASF. At the end of 2016, 43% recommended buying our shares (end of 2015: 32%) and 39% recommended holding them (end of 2015: 40%), while 18% had a sell rating (end of 2015: 28%). The average target share price ascribed to BASF by analysts was 79.65 in December 2016.

Close dialog with the capital market
 Roadshows for institutional investors and talks with rating agencies
 BASF Roundtable Asia Pacific  Information events for private investors
Our corporate strategy aims to create long-term value. We support this strategy through regular and open communication with all capital market participants. To keep institutional investors and rating agencies informed, we host numerous one-on-one meetings and roadshows worldwide. We also hold informational events to provide private investors with a n insight into BASF. In 2016, around 1,500 private investors took the opportunity to attend such events in Germany and Austria.
At the end of September 2016, we informed analysts and investors at our "Roundtable Asia Pacific" event in London about our activities in the region as well as the growth potential for the chemical industry. With the aid of concrete measures and examples, it was explained how BASF intends to continue growing profitably in the Asia Pacific region in the future.
In 2016, we once again held special events aimed toward investors who base their investment decisions on sustainability criteria. There, we outlined in particular our measures for climate protection and energy efficiency. In addition, we offered several special creditor relations roadshows, where creditors and credit analysts could learn more about our business and financing strategy.

Investors can find comprehensive information about BASF and BASF shares on our website and on social media platforms.
Analysts and investors have confirmed the quality of our communication work: We took first place among European chemical companies in the annual survey conducted by B ritain's IR Magazine. Institutional Investor Magazine recognized BASF in such areas as best investor day and best investor relations program in the European chemical industry. Moreover, the British IR Society honored the integration of sustainability reporting into BASF's corporate communications activities with first place in this international category. BASF won the Building Public Trust Award from auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for best integrated corporate report in 2015. The award, which was presented in Germany for the first time, is intended to recognize companies for their open, honest and transparent reporting, not just of the classic repor ting elements but also nonfinancial aspects such as sustain ability, risk management and corporate governance.

BASF has companies in more than 80 countries and supplies products to numerous customers in nearly every part of the world. In 2016, we generated 43% of our sales (excluding Oil & Gas) with customers in Europe. In addition, 26% of sales were generated in North America; 22% in Asia Pacific; and 9% in South America, Africa, Middle East. Viewed over the entire BASF Group, 45% of our sales were to customers in Europe, 25% in North America, 21% in Asia Pacific and 9% in South America, Africa, Middle East.
We operate six Verbund sites and 352 additional production sites worldwide. Our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen is the world's largest integrated chemical complex. This was where the Verbund principle was originally developed and steadily honed before being implemented at additional sites.

The Verbund system is one of BASF's great strengths. Here, we add value as one company by using our resources e fficiently. The Production Verbund intelligently links production units and energy demand so that, for example, the waste heat of one plant provides energy to others. Furthermore, one facility's by-products can serve as feedstock elsewhere. This not only saves us raw materials and energy, it also avoids emissions, lowers logistics costs and makes use of synergies.
We also make use of the Verbund principle for more than production, applying it for technologies, knowledge, employees, customers, and partners, as well. Expert knowledge is pooled into our global research platforms.

The BASF brand

Global standards

 Above-average awareness of, and trust in, BASF brand in chemical industry
We rely on a strong brand in order to further expand our position as the world's leading chemical company. Our brand is derived from our strategy and our corporate purpose ­ "We create chemistry for a sustainable future" ­ as well as our strategic principles and values.
"Connected" describes the essence of the BASF brand. Connectivity is one of BASF's great strengths. Our Verbund concept ­ realized in production, technologies, knowledge, employees, customers and partners ­ enables innovative solutions for a sustainable future. The claim that "We create chemistry," as stated in the BASF logo, helps us embed this solution-oriented strategy in the public consciousness. Our brand creates value by helping communicate its benefits for our stakeholders as well as our values.
Wherever our stakeholders encounter our brand, we want to convince them that BASF stands for connectivity, intelligent solutions, value-adding partnerships, an attractive working e nvironment and sustainability. This contributes to our customers' confidence in their buying decisions and to our company value.
We are constantly developing our brand image. We regularly measure awareness of and trust in our brand, and therefore in our company. A global market research study conducted every two years showed in 2016 that, in terms of awareness and trust, BASF is above the industry average in numerous countries. The study collected data on respondents' aided awareness of BASF and our most important competitors. Our goal is to continue increasing awareness of BASF in all of our relevant markets.

 We act according to clearly defined values and s tandards of conduct that comply with or go beyond laws and regulations
 We review our performance with regular audits
Our standards fulfill or exceed existing laws and regulations and take internationally recognized principles into account. We respect and promote: ­­The ten principles of the U.N. Global Compact ­­The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two
U.N. Human Rights Covenants ­­The core labor standards of the ILO and the Tripartite
D eclaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterp rises and Social Policy (MNE Declaration) ­­The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises ­­The Responsible Care Global Charter ­­The German Corporate Governance Code
We stipulate rules for our employees with standards that apply throughout the Group. We set ourselves ambitious goals with voluntary commitments and monitor our performance in terms of the environment, health and safety using our Responsible Care Management System. In terms of labor and social standards, this takes place using three elements: the Compliance Program (including the external compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations), and the global management process for the respect of international labor norms.
Our business partners are expected to comply with prevailing laws and regulations and to align their actions with internationally recognized principles. We have established monitoring systems to ensure this.

Innovations for a sustainable future

Business expansion in emerging markets

Innovations in chemistry are needed to meet the needs of the growing world population on a long-term basis. The development of innovative products and solutions is, therefore, of vital significance for BASF. In the long term, we aim to continue significantly increasing sales and earnings with new and improved products. Effective and efficient research is therefore indispensable.
We drive intensive research and development activities in our established business areas. One focus of our research is on the enhancement and innovative application of specific key technologies. They pool the diverse competencies of our international Research and Development Verbund to strengthen our competitive ability in the long-term. We also work on specific growth fields in order to develop future business fields for BASF. With our research, we aim to make a decisive contrib ution to innovative solutions for global challenges and contribute to sustainable development.
Our three global technology platforms are each based in one of the regions particularly significant for us: Process R esearch & Chemical Engineering (Ludwigshafen, Germany), Advanced Materials & Systems Research (Shanghai, China) and Bioscience Research (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). We want to continue expanding our research and development activities on a global level, and are also adapting this to the growth in regional markets. The stronger global presence of our research and development opens up new opportunities to actively participate in worldwide innovation processes and gain access to talent.
For more on innovation, see page 32 onward

In the years ahead, we want to grow even more vigorously in the emerging markets and further expand our position there. Today's emerging markets are expected to account for around 60% of global chemical production in 2020. We aim to benefit from the above-average growth in these regions and therefore plan to invest more than a quarter of our capital expenditures1 there between 2017 and 2021.
Growth in the emerging markets remained overall stable in 2016 as compared with the previous year. In China, government support measures kept growth from slowing down as much as we had expected. The other emerging markets of Asia were able to largely retain their growth dynamic. Gross domestic product continued to drop in South America. Brazil found itself in a severe recession, while gross domestic product decreased slightly in Argentina, as well. Economic performance in Russia shrank only marginally after sharp declines in the previous year; a contributing factor was the stabilization of oil prices. Overall, the emerging markets of eastern Europe were able to post slight growth once again.
Compared with 2015, sales (excluding Oil & Gas) at our companies headquartered in the emerging markets declined by 3% to 14,849 million. Increased sales volumes could only partly compensate for negative currency and price effects. Measured by customer location, sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in the emerging markets fell by 4% to 18,742 million. This brought sales to customers in emerging markets to around 34% of total sales (excluding Oil & Gas) in 2016. In the years ahead, we want to continue expanding this percentage.

1 We define relevant suppliers as those showing an elevated sustainability risk potential as identified by risk matrices and with respect to corresponding country risks. Our suppliers are evaluated based on risk due to the size and scale of our supplier portfolio.

Growth and profitability

As determined in 2015, our aim for the years ahead is, on average, to grow sales slightly faster and EBITDA considerably faster than global chemical production (excluding pharma ceuticals; 2016: 3.4%), and to earn a significant premium on our cost of capital. Moreover, we strive for a high level of free cash flow each year, either raising or at least maintaining the dividend at the prior-year level. The goals for sales and EBITDA are based on the 2015 figures, excluding contributions from the business disposed of in the asset swap with Gazprom in September 2015.

28 Management's Report
Our strategy -- Value-based management 

BASF Report 2016

Value-based management

"We add value as one company" is one of the four principles of our "We create chemistry" strategy. To create value in the long term, a company's earnings must exceed the cost of stockholders' equity and borrowing costs. This is why we strive to earn a significant premium on our cost of capital. To ensure BASF's long-term success, we encourage and support all employees in thinking and acting entrepreneurially in line with our value-based management concept. Our goal: to create awareness as to how each and every employee can find value-oriented solutions in the company's day-to-day operations and implement these in an effective and efficient manner.
EBIT after cost of capital
 Performance and management indicator
Income from operations (EBIT) after cost of capital is a key performance and management indicator for the BASF Group, its operating divisions and business units. This figure combines the company's economic situation as summarized in EBIT with the costs for the capital made available to us by shareholders and creditors. When EBIT exceeds cost of capital, we earn a premium on our cost of capital and exceed the return expected by our shareholders.
Calculating EBIT after cost of capital
 Cost of capital determined using cost of capital percentage and cost of capital basis
To calculate EBIT after cost of capital, we take the BASF Group's EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other ­ not allocated to the segments ­ and subtract the cost of capital of the BASF Group from the resulting figure. Cost of capital is determined by applying cost of capital before taxes to the value of the cost of capital basis at each month end. Monthly cost of capital is then added up over the course of the year.
The cost of capital percentage (weighted average cost of capital, WACC) is determined using the weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs. The cost of equity is ascertained using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Borrowing costs are determined based on the financing costs of the BASF Group. EBIT after cost of capital, which we use as a steering parameter, is a pretax figure. Therefore, we use the current average tax rate to derive the pretax cost of capital percentage from the WACC. The projected net expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment in the cost of capital percentage.
The cost of capital basis consists of a segment's oper ating assets plus the customer and supplier financing not included there. Operating assets comprise the current and noncurrent asset items1 used by the operating divisions.

Value-based management throughout the company
 Exercising a value-oriented mindset in day-to-day business by every employee
For us, value-based management means the daily focus placed on value by all of our employees. To this end, we have identified value drivers that show how each and every unit in the company can create value. We develop performance indicators for the individual value drivers that help us to plan and pursue changes.
An important factor in ensuring the successful implementation of value-based management is linking the goals of BASF to the individual target agreements of employees. In the operating units, the most important performance indicator is EBIT after cost of capital. By contrast, the functional units' contribution to value is assessed on the basis of effectiveness and efficiency.
All this forms a consistent system of value drivers and key indicators for the individual levels and functions at BASF. In addition to EBIT after cost of capital, EBIT and EBIT before special items are the most significant performance indicators for measuring economic success as well as for steering the BASF Group and its operating units.
We primarily comment on EBIT before special items on a segment and division level in our financial reporting. Special items arise from the integration of acquired businesses, restructuring measures, impairments, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, and other expen ses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities. Adjusting for special items makes EBIT before special items an especially suitable figure for illustrating development over time. In addition to EBIT before special items, we also report on sales as a further main driver for EBIT after cost of capital. BASF's nonfinancial targets are focused more on the long term, and are not used for short-term steering.
According to our value-based management concept, all employees can make a contribution in their business area to help ensure that we earn the targeted premium on our cost of capital. We pass this value-based management concept on to our team around the world through seminars and training events, thereby promoting entrepreneurial thinking at all levels within BASF.

Our strategy -- Sustainability management

Sustainability management

Sustainability is an integral part of our corporate strategy. Using the various tools of our sustainability management, we carry out our company purpose: "We create chemistry for a sustainable future." Sustainability is integrated into our core business, in line with our strategic principle "We drive sustainable solutions." This is how we seize business opportunities and minimize risks along the value chain.

They provide strategic orientation for BASF's commitments in meeting the growing challenges along the value chain: ­­We source responsibly. ­­We produce safely for people and the environment. ­­We produce efficiently. ­­We respect people and treat them fairly. ­­We drive sustainable solutions.

Strategy
 Recognizing significant topics and trends  Taking advantage of business opportunities  Minimizing risks
As the world's leading chemical company, we aim to add value in the long term for our company, the environment, and society. Sustainability is a driver for growth as well as an element of our risk management. That is why we incorporate aspects of sustainability into our decision-making processes and have defined clear responsibilities in our organization.
We have created structures to promote sustainable, entrepreneurial actions all the way from strategy to implementation. The Corporate Sustainability Board is BASF's central steering committee for sustainable development. It is comprised of the heads of our business, corporate and functional units as well as of the regions. A member of the Board of Executive Directors serves as chair. We have also established an external, independent Stakeholder Advisory Council. Here, international experts from science and society contribute important external perspectives to discussions with BASF's Board of Executive Directors, thereby helping us expand our strengths and identify our potential for improvement.
Through our materiality analysis, constant dialog with stakeholders, and our many years of experience, we are continuously developing a better understanding of significant topics and trends as well as potential opportunities and risks along our value chain.
We were already using a materiality analysis back in 2013 to identify such topics as energy and climate, water, resources and ecosystems, responsible production, and employment and employability. A strategic evaluation process built upon this in 2015 and 2016 to define new focus topics along the value chain.

Relevant topics resulting from these commitments form the focal points of our reporting, which we integrate into our longterm steering processes.
We take advantage of business opportunities by offering our customers innovative products and solutions that contribute to sustainable development. We ensure that sustainability criteria are integrated into our business units' development and implementation of strategies, research projects, and innovation processes. For example, we analyze sustainability- related market trends in customer industries, such as the packaging industry, in order to zero in on taking advantage of new business opportunities.
Our risk management supports our long-term business success. We aim to reduce potential risks in the areas of environment, safety and security, health protection, product stewardship, compliance, and labor and social standards by setting ourselves globally uniform requirements that frequently go beyond legal requirements. Internal monitoring systems and complaint mechanisms enable us to check compliance with these standards: they include, for example, questionnaires, audits and compliance hotlines. All employees, managers, and Board members are required to abide by our global Code of Conduct, which defines a mandatory framework for our b usiness activities.
Our investment decisions for property, plant and equipment and financial assets also involve sustainability criteria. Our decision-making is supported by expert appraisals that assess economic implications as well as potential effects on the environment, human rights or local communities.

Parts of our business activities, such as the use of new technologies, are frequently viewed by our stakeholders with a critical eye. In order to increase societal acceptance for our business activities, we take on critical questions, assess our business activities in terms of their sustainability, and communicate transparently. Such dialogs help us to even better understand society's expectations of us and which measures we need to pursue in order to establish trust and build partnerships.
To involve our stakeholders even more closely, members of the Board of Executive Directors once again met with the Stakeholder Advisory Council in 2016 to discuss important aspects of sustainability. Topics include further integrating sustainability into our company, as well as our new "Value to Society" approach. This involves evaluating the societal benefits and costs generated by BASF's business activities.
We have a particular responsibility toward our production sites' neighbors. With the established community advisory panels, we aim to promote open exchange between citizens and our site management, and strengthen trust in our activities. In 2016, we developed new, globally applicable requirem ents for community advisory panels at our sites. These minimum requirements are oriented toward the grievance mechanisms outlined in the U.N. Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. We keep track of their implementation through the existing global databank of the R esponsible Care Management System.
BASF is involved in worldwide initiatives with various stakeholder groups, such as the U.N. Global Compact. BASF's Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors is a member of the United Nations Global Compact Board. As a member of the U.N. Global Compact LEAD initiative, we support the implementation of the "Agenda 2030" and its Sustainable D evelopment Goals. BASF is also active in local Global Compact networks.
We are part of the Global Business Initiative on H uman Rights (GBI). This group of globally operating companies from various branches aims to ensure implementation of the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. With international experts at the GBI conference in South Africa, we discussed how we can support a mining company and BASF supplier in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to human rights.
Our lobbying and political communications are conducted in accordance with transparent guidelines and in keeping with our publicly stated positions. BASF does not financially support political parties. In the United States, employees at BASF

Corporation have made use of their right to establish a Political Action Committee (PAC). The BASF Corporation Employee PAC is a voluntary, federally registered employee association founded in 1998. It collects donations for political purposes and independently decides how these are used, in accordance with U.S. law.

Creating value
 Value to Society: method for assessing economic, environmental and social impact of business activities along the value chain
 Evaluating sustainability performance to steer product portfolio
We want to measure the value proposition of our actions along the entire value chain, aware that our business activities are connected to both positive and negative impacts on the environment and society. We strive to increase our positive contribution to society and minimize the negative effects of our business activities.
In order to achieve this, we need to understand better than ever how our actions impact society and the environment. We already have many years of experience evaluating our products and processes using such methods as eco-efficiency analyses, the Sustainable Solution Steering® portfolio analysis, or BASF's corporate carbon footprint.
Building on this, BASF has been developing a new method with external experts since 2014 to perform the first monetary assessment of the economic, ecological, and social impacts of its business activities along the value chain: the "Value to Society" approach. It enables a direct comparison between financial and nonfinancial effects on society, along with how these interact.
This transparency supports the integrated character of our actions, contributing to BASF's long-term success. The results of these assessments are helpful in our discussions with stakeholders, in internal progress measurements, and in decision-making processes.
We contribute our approach and expertise to current debates on the monetary value of the economic, environmental and social impact of business decisions. We share our experie nce in networks and are involved in the corresponding standardization processes within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Significant sustainability concern identified and action plan in development

A significant lever for the targeted steering of our product portfolio, based on the sustainability performance of our products, is the Sustainable Solution Steering® method. By the end of the 2016 business year, BASF had conducted sustainability assessments and ratings for 95.9% of its entire relevant portfolio of more than 60,000 specific product applications ­ which account for 53.2 billion in sales. We consider the products' application in various markets and industries. Because of increasing sustainability requirements on the market, we regularly conduct reassessments of existing product categories as well as of the relevant portfolio.
"Accelerator" products make a particular contribution to sustainability in the value chain. That is why we want to increase the proportion of sales from Accelerator products to 28% by 2020. In 2016, this figure was at 27.2%.

2020 Goal
Increase proportion of sales generated by Accelerator products

to 28%

One of our Accelerator products for the agricultural sector is Limus®, an additive for urea-based fertilizers. Using purely urea-based fertilizers means the loss of a large portion of nitrogen ­ one of the most important crop nutrients ­ through the activity of the urease enzyme. Adding Limus® inhibits this enzyme and ensures a constant supply of nitrogen. At the same time, less ammonia is released into the atmosphere. Ammonia contributes to smog, as well as to overfertilization and alternation of the ecosystem. Limus® thus leads to more consistent harvest yields while protecting the environment.
"Transitioners" are products with specific sustainability challenges that are being actively tackled. Due to the adjustment of the portfolio under evaluation, the number of these products rose in 2016. A fuel additive from our Keropur® line is one example of how we enhance the sustainability performance of our products. Such innovative fuel additives increase the efficiency of combustion engines. The result is reduced fuel consumption, and therefore fewer pollutant emissions. Keropur® 3638 is categorized as a Transitioner because it

contains a liquid hydrocarbon mixture. This hydrocarbon mixture contains naphthalene, which categorizes it as a CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) substance. In order to address some of our customers' occupational safety concerns, a research project was begun and a solution developed. Customers can now obtain the alternative Keropur® 3708, free of CMR substances.
For all products classified as "Challenged," we aim to d evelop prompt plans of action, even in the case of portfolio revisions and product reassessments. These action plans can include research projects, reformulations or even replacing one product with an alternative product. At the end of 2016, action plans had been created for 100% of Challenged products.
We furthermore promoted sustainability topics in 2016 through various joint projects with partners along the value chain. One such project involved supporting the agricultural trading company AGRAVIS Raiffeisen AG, based in Münster/ Hannover, in conducting calculations for the manufacture of sustainable feed mixes. BASF developed an online calculation program that compares various feed mixes for pigs using sustainability criteria along the entire value chain. The under lying eco-efficiency analysis measures various parameters like emissions to water, land use, CO2 emissions and costs. Customers can use this information to figure out how to reduce their products' environmental impact while keeping an eye on costs. For example, a comparison between conventional and optimized feed mixes showed how impact on the environment can be significantly reduced while production costs remain nearly unchanged. Major factors here included minimizing water and land use. With new combinable feed mixes containing grain by-products and other ingredients, reductions can be attained in the use of arable land for producing feed for hogs.

A growing need for food, clean water and energy, limited resources and a booming world population ­ reconciling all these factors is the greatest challenge of our time. Innovations based on chemistry play a key role here, as they contribute decisively to new solutions. Effective and efficient research and development are a prerequisite for innovations as well as an important growth engine for BASF. We work in interdisciplinary teams on innovative processes and products for a sustainable future. This is how we ensure our long-term business success with chemistry-based solutions for almost all sectors of industry.
For BASF, innovation is the key to successfully standing out from the crowd in a challenging market environment. Our innovative strength is based on our global team of highly qualified employees with various specializations. We had around 10,000 employees involved in research and development in 2016. Our three global technology platforms are each run from one of the regions particularly significant for us ­ Europe, Asia Pacific and North America: Process Research & Chemical Engineering (Ludwigshafen, Germany), Advanced Materials & Systems Research (Shanghai, China) and Bioscience Research (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). Together with the development units in our operating divisions, they form the core of our global Know-How Verbund. BASF New Business GmbH and BASF Venture Capital GmbH supplement this network with the task of using new technologies to tap into attractive markets and new business models for BASF.
In 2016, we generated sales of over 10 billion with products launched on the market since 2011 that stemmed from research and development activities. In the long term, we aim to continue significantly increasing sales and earnings with new and improved products.
Global network
 Network with around 600 universities, research institutes and companies
Our global network of about 600 universities, research institutes and companies forms an important part of our KnowHow Verbund. We collaborate with them in many different

disciplines. The direct access to external scientific expertise, new technologies and talented minds from various disciplines strengthens our portfolio with creative new projects.
In our excellence program "UNIQUE ­ The BASF Academic Partnership Program," we are working intensively with fifteen leading universities around the world. BASF also runs four postdoc centers that pool collaborations with several research groups on a regional level. The North American Center for Research on Advanced Materials (NORA) and the California Research Alliance (CARA) are located in North America. The Joint Research Network on Advanced Materials and Systems (JONAS) is active in Europe, while the Network for Advanced Materials Open Research (NAO) covers the Asia Pacific region.
In order to continuously promote exchange with external customers and partners, we have integrated the Creator Space® approach from our 2015 anniversary year into our regular research activities. We use this program to develop innovative ideas.
Strategic focus
 Enhanced innovation approach with strong focus on customers and markets
 Increased use of digital technologies  Globalizing research and strengthening regional
competencies
Our research pipeline comprised approximately 3,000 projects in 2016. Expenses for research and development amounted to around 1,863 million, slightly below the prior year's level (1,953 million). This was particularly attributable to the rearrangement of research activities in plant biotechnology and the corresponding adjustment of site structure in North America and Europe. Operating divisions were responsible for 79% of total research and development expenses in 2016. The remaining 21% was allocated to cross-divisional corporate research focusing on long-term topics of strategic importance to the BASF Group. We strive to maintain the recent years' high level of spending on research and development.
Innovations based on chemistry require market-oriented research and development focused on the needs of our customers. That is why our cross-divisional corporate research is closely aligned with the requirements of our operating

BASF Report 2016 

Management's Report 33
Innovation

divisions. In order to bring promising ideas to market as quickly as possible, we regularly assess our research projects using a multistep process and focus our topics accordingly. Creativity, efficiency and collaboration with external partners are among the most important success factors.
We enhanced our innovation approach in 2016 with the aim of increasing our company's power of innovation and s ecuring long-term competitive ability. We aim to achieve this by honing our research focus on topics that are strategically relevant for our business, strengthening our existing scientific processes and methods and introducing new ones, and optimizing organizational structures.
In so doing, we restructured cross-divisional corporate research in 2016 to create more space for the quick review of creative research approaches. At the same time, we tailored our previous technology fields even more toward the needs of the BASF Group. They have been rearranged into multiple, strategic key technologies that are constantly being further developed. We also place our focus on the innovative application of specific key technologies that are of central significance for our operating divisions. Examples include polymer technologies, catalyst processes and strategies for the development of biodegradable and bio-based materials.
In order to develop future business fields with high sales potential for BASF, we develop specific growth fields. These are regularly reviewed in terms of their attractiveness for BASF.

When they mature, we transfer them to the operating divisions and promote the development of new approaches with high market potential. In addition, we have set a course for systematically using digital technologies in research and development. In the years ahead, existing expertise in fields like modeling and simulation will be consistently expanded and new digital work areas will be developed.
After rearranging our research activities in plant biotechnology, we undertook further organizational adjustments to our global R+D structures at the end of 2016. Research activi ties in Singapore were discontinued toward the end of the year due to market developments. We are pursuing the research topics located there at other sites. Research and development activities at the European research sites in Basel and Düsseldorf were restructured in order to be able to support the operating divisions there more effectively.
Our global research and development presence is vital to our success. In 2015, we had completed the expansion of the Innovation Campus Asia Pacific in Shanghai, China. A second Innovation Campus Asia Pacific is now being set up in Mumbai, India, in order to continue strengthening our regional research capacities. There, the focus areas in research will be on crop protection and method development.

We want to continue advancing our research and development activities in Asia especially, as well as in North America, and are adapting this to the growth in regional markets. This increased presence outside Europe creates new opportunities for fortifying and expanding customer relations and scientific collaborations and for gaining access to talented employees. The result will be to strengthen our Research and Development Verbund and make BASF an even more attractive partner and employer, both on a global level and in the regions.
Ludwigshafen remains the largest site in our Research Verbund. In the nearby BASF agricultural center of Limburgerhof ­ headquarters of the Crop Protection division ­ a new research and development center for biological crop protection and seed solutions was opened in April 2016.
The number and quality of our patents also attest to our power of innovation and long-term competitiveness. We filed around 850 new patents worldwide in 2016. For the eighth time in succession, we headed the rankings in the Patent Asset Index in 2016 ­ a method which compares patent portfolios industry-wide.
For a multiyear overview of research and development expenditures, see the Ten-Year Summary on page 233
Research focus areas ­ examples
 Innovations based in chemistry to answer important questions of the future
Our focus areas in research are derived from the three major areas in which chemistry-based innovations will play a key role in the future: resources, environment and climate; food and nutrition; and quality of life.
The field of efficient energy systems reveals high innovation and market potential. In this context, BASF is working on such topics as the development of high-temperature superconductors based on yttrium barium copper oxide, which transmits electricity at low temperatures with negligible loss and enables savings potential in generating and transporting power. Its current-carrying capacity is twenty times greater than that of copper, the most commonly used material in electrical lines. Two milestones have been achieved on the path toward a market launch: BASF and the global energy company American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) announced a licensing agreement and research cooperation together in March 2016. Furthermore, Deutsche Nanoschicht GmbH, a 100% subsidiary of BASF New Business GmbH, started up a pilot plant for manufacturing high-temperature super conductors in May 2016.

As the market leader in chemicals, BASF holds a special responsibility toward people and the environment. Accor dingly, new products undergo comprehensive environmental and toxicological testing before being brought to market. These tasks are appointed to the Bioscience Research technology platform and include the search for new methods to reduce, improve or replace the animal testing required by law. We are the global forerunner in the chemical industry in developing such alternative methods. In May 2016, LuSens, an alternative method developed by BASF, was validated by the European Union. LuSens is one component of a three-part testing strategy that enables reliable screening for allergic skin reactions on contact with chemicals.
3-D printing involves the development of innovative materials. Compared with injection molding, 3-D printing offers advantages such as lower costs in small-series production, more time efficiency, and the realization of complex structural elements in a single manufacturing process. In the chemical industry, BASF has a broad material portfolio for 3-D printing at its disposal. BASF New Business GmbH is constructing a development center in Heidelberg, Germany, to develop improved materials and optimize the interplay between materials and 3-D printers, together with partners like printer manu facturer Farsoon Technologies. Furthermore, our Advanced Materials & Systems Research technology platform is active in this field at the sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Basel, Switzerland; Wyandotte, Michigan; and Shanghai, China. One attest to BASF's competencies in material development is U ltrasint PA6 X028, launched in April 2016. This powder, based on polyamide 6, is geared toward use in the laser sintering technique widely used in 3-D printing. Compared with conventional polyamides, it provides superior mechanical stability and higher heat resistance. Furthermore, BASF a nnounced its intention in November 2016 to expand its cooperation with American printer manufacturer HP in order to move forward with the development of new 3-D print materials.
In the E.U.-supported PRODIAS1 project, researchers and developers of our Process Research & Chemical Engineering technology platform are working together with partners from industry and academia on methods and processes that allow products based on renewable raw materials to be produced efficiently and with fewer resources, while simultaneously increasing the competitiveness of these products. The biotechnological processes used, like fermentation, mostly take place in diluted aqueous systems that demand energy- intensive steps for separation and purification. Through the use of freeze concentration ­ a technique typical in the food industry ­ we managed to concentrate biotechnologically produced products in an especially gentle manner with negligible losses for the first time in 2016.

Chemicals: In 2016, we established the Amsterdam-based Synvina C.V. joint venture with Avantium to produce and market furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from renewable resources on an industrial scale. The most significant use of FDCS is the production of polyethylenefuranoate (PEF), a new polymer used for applications such as food and beverage packaging. Compared with conventional plastics, PEF demonstrates higher barrier properties for gases like carbon dioxide and oxy gen, leading to a longer shelf life for packaged products. In addition, its higher mechanical strength allows for thinner ­ and therefore lighter ­ packaging.
Our new HydroBlue®90 demonstrates that innovation and enhancement are even possible for products that were patented over 100 years ago. The product originally went to market as an auxiliary agent in dyeing textiles with indigo. Today, HydroBlue®90 ensures consistent high quality in the dyeing process. This stability is important for textile producers, as signs of faulty coloring in denim do not usually appear until after the garment is already finished. New HydroBlue®90 is especially highly concentrated, shelf-stable, odorless and dust-free.
With Ultramid® C37LC, BASF launched a new, high- quality copolyamide on the market in 2016. It ensures a stabler and more efficient production process for shrink films used in food packaging. Films produced with Ultramid® C37LC are considerably softer and more transparent than those made from conventional materials. Manufacturers of fishing nets and lines can also further increase the quality of their products using the new plastic.
Performance Products: Flexible food packaging must fulfill the highest functional requirements; at the same time, interest is growing in environmentally friendly solutions. That is why we are constantly enhancing the ink bonding agents of our Joncryl® FLX product line and the laminating adhesives of the Epotal® range. These water-based products provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to solvent-based systems for flexible packaging. With Epotal®, packaging manufacturers can also shorten the processing time between order placement and delivery.

Lavergy® Pro 104 L is a newly developed protease ­ or protein-splitting enzyme. Liquid detergents formulated with this enzyme are already powerfully effective at low washing temperatures, removing certain tough stains considerably better than the established market standards. Lavergy® Pro 104 L is even more powerful when combined with our high-performance detergent polymer Sokalan® HP 20. Expertise in both biology and chemistry allows us to offer customers even more opportunities to precisely customize liquid detergent formulations.
Farmers require high-quality feed for their animals. Yet preserved feed, typically in the form of silage, and water are both susceptible to pathogenic microorganisms. Adding our Lupro-Mix® NA organic acid mixture inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and mold, allowing livestock to receive silage and water of the highest quality. Farmers also benefit from the fact that Lupro-Mix® NA is easier and safer to use than comparable products, while remaining nevertheless economical.
Plastic components offer possibilities to make vehicles lighter, more comfortable, and more aesthetically pleasing. Additives like light stabilizers are used to maintain the original properties and appearance of materials and surfaces for as long as possible. Tinuvin® 880 is a novel light stabilizer that significantly increases the durability of plastic parts exposed to UV radiation and heat, making it suitable for automotive applications that require plastics to stand up to high levels of stress. Tinuvin® 880 can also be used in the construction, agricultural and packaging industries.
Functional Materials & Solutions: To meet ever-tightening exhaust regulations for diesel vehicles, manufacturers employ special catalysts for nitrogen oxides (NOX) such as lean NOX trap (LNT) technology, that is, NOX adsorbers. With EMPRO® LNT, BASF has launched a new generation of these catalysts that are especially robust and powerful, even under widely various driving conditions, like city traffic, country roads, or interstate highways.
MasterSuna SBS is a new concrete additive that allows previously unsuitable types of sand to be processed into highgrade concrete. Clay minerals in sand usually prevent concrete superplasticizers from doing their job. With MasterSuna SBS, even sand containing high levels of clay can be used in the production of consistently high-quality concrete. Concrete producers save considerable costs, as they no longer need to pay for the transport of more suitable sands from distant sand pits. Fewer sand pits need to be opened, as well, which helps protect the environment and landscape.

Our Cool Coatings automotive coating technology combines innovative functional properties with a sophisticated design that allows for a broad color palette. The coating formulation reflects infrared light, reducing the vehicle's surface temperature by up to 20°C. This passive temperature management reduces the inside temperature by up to 4°C. Cool Coatings thus enables our customers to save on air conditioning, which decreases fuel consumption or, in the case of electric vehicles, increases range.
Ultramid® Advanced N, our new portfolio of heat-resistant polyamides, gives customers in different industries greater freedom for innovation, such as when it comes to developing technically sophisticated end-user products. It allows for the construction of lighter, smaller and more high-performance plastic components for demanding operating conditions, such as in automotive construction, household appliances or entertainment electronics. With Ecovio® EA, BASF has developed a high-performance foam that is bio-based and compostable. Its excellent properties make it especially suitable for the transport packaging of valuable, heavy or fragile goods that require high shock resistance and durability.
Agricultural Solutions: We are working with farmers around the globe to improve the quality and yield of their agricultural production while taking into account societal expectations and requirements. To achieve this, we constantly invest in our development pipeline in order to expand our portfolio both in and beyond conventional crop protection ­ such as in biological solutions. In 2016, we invested 489 million in research and development in the Crop Protection division, representing around 9% of sales for the segment.
Our well-stocked innovation pipeline comprises products with a launch date between 2016 and 2026. With a peak sales potential1 of 3 billion, the pipeline comprises innovations from all business areas. The herbicide Engenia® is being introduced to the North American market for the 2017 growing season. It serves as a key component of dicamba and glyphosate- tolerant cropping systems for soy and cotton. We are also planning the launch of the new insecticides Inscalis® and

broflanilide. Inscalis® combats piercing-sucking pests like aphids and whiteflies. An application for approval was submitted in 2016. Broflanilide is effective against chewing insects, like potato beetles and caterpillars, in specialty and field crops; use is also planned in professional pest control. With its novel mode of action, it is highly effective in low doses and will play an important role in resistance management.
We submitted the first approval applications for our new fungicide, Revysol®, in 2016. The active ingredient Revysol® is highly effective in combating a number of hard-to-control fungal infections, like Septoria tritici, an agent that causes leaf blotch in wheat. It will be offered in regionally and customer- specific product formulations and used in all important field and specialty crops worldwide. The first market launches are scheduled for the 2019 growing season upon registration with the relevant authorities.
For more on Inscalis®, see page 81
Oil & Gas: The Wintershall Group concentrates its innovation-related activities on improving the success rate of exploration, developing technologies for reservoirs with challenging development and production conditions, and increasing the recovery factor of reservoirs.
In the Düste crude oilfield in Germany, we tested an innovative and environmentally friendly method for increasing the reservoir's recovery factor and have achieved positive initial results. Wintershall developed a concept within the BASF Verbund for microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR): We aim to use tiny life forms found in the reservoir, like microbes and microorganisms, to produce more crude oil. Fed nutrients, these multiply and produce various natural substances as metabolic products that can increase the oil recovery factor. Unlike other enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies, the use of microbes in MEOR can have several production- increasing effects at the same time. We also successfully managed, for the first time, to model these effects outside of the reservoir, allowing for more efficient use. A larger field test is scheduled to begin in 2017.

Optimization
Of our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures

In addition to innovations, investments and acquisitions make a decisive contribution toward achieving our ambitious growth goals. We are intensifying our investment in emerging markets and in North America. We use targeted acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.

By investing in our plants, we create the conditions for our desired growth while constantly improving the efficiency of our production processes. For the period from 2017 to 2021, we have planned capital expenditures1 totaling 19.0 billion. We want to invest more than a quarter of this amount in emerging markets and expand our local presence in order to benefit from the growth in these regions. In North America, investments in new production facilities form the basis of future growth. We also continue to develop our portfolio through acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth, are driven by innovation, offer added value for our customers, and reduce the cyclicality of our earnings. Investments and acquisitions alike are prepared by interdisciplinary teams and assessed using diverse criteria. In this way, we ensure that economic, environmental and social concerns are included in strategic decision-making.

We invested 4,222 million in property, plant and equipment in 2016. Total investments were therefore 1,429 million lower than in the previous year and 531 million above the level of depreciation3 in 2016. Our investments in 2016 focused on the Chemicals, Performance Products and Oil & Gas segments.
In Ludwigshafen, Germany, we started up further sections of our integrated TDI complex in 2016. TDI production began in August 2016. In November 2016, the TDI plant was temporarily shut down due to a technical defect in one part. Repairwork was ongoing at the time of this report's release. We continued work on revamping the new superabsorbent technology at the site in Antwerp, B elgium, and plan to complete this in 2017.
With our partner, PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad, headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, we completed construction on the new aroma ingredients complex at the integrated chemical site in Kuantan, Malaysia. Production facilities for citral and L-menthol will be gradually started up. In June 2016, we began construction of a new automotive coatings plant in Shanghai, China, together with our partner Shanghai Huayi Fine Chemical Co. Ltd., based in Shanghai, China. With these investments, we are expanding our presence in the emerging markets of Asia.
We are constructing an ammonia production plant in Freeport, Texas, together with Yara International ASA, headquartered in Oslo, Norway. At our site in Geismar, Louisiana, we completed the expansion of our butanediol capacities in 2016. The capacity expansion of our dicamba production in Beaumont, Texas, is expected to start up in 2017.
In the Oil & Gas segment, we invested primarily in field development projects in Argentina, Norway and Russia in 2016.

We gained 155 million worth of property, plant and equipment through acquisitions in 2016. Additions to intangible a ssets including goodwill amounted to 2,789 million.
On September 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Guangdong Yinfan Chemistry ("Yinfan") in Jiangmen, China, and integrated the business into the Coatings division. This enabled us to add the Yinfan product line to our portfolio of automotive refinish coatings in Asia Pacific and gain access to a state-of-the-art production facility for automotive refinish coatings in China.
The purchase of global surface technology provider Chemetall from Albemarle Corp. in Charlotte, North Carolina, was completed on December 14, 2016. With the acquisition of this business, our Coatings division supplements its port folio of tailor-made technology and system solutions for surface treatment. The purchase price amounted to $3.1 billion.
Effective January 1, 2017, we acquired the Henkel Group's western European building material business for professional users, broadening the portfolio of our Construction Chemicals division.
For more information on acquisitions, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 174 onward

Divestitures
We completed the sale of the global polyolefin catalysts business to W.R. Grace & Co., based in Columbia, Maryland, on June 30, 2016. The transaction involved technologies, patents, trademarks and the transfer of production plants in Pasadena, Texas, and Tarragona, Spain. These activities had been assigned to the Catalysts division.
On August 26, 2016, we divested our global photoinitiator business to IGM Resins B.V., based in Wallwijk, Netherlands. The transaction comprised technology, patents, trademarks, customer relationships, contracts and inventories as well as the photoinitiator production site in Mortara, Italy. These activi ties had been organized under the Dispersions & Pigments division. High-performance photoinitiators for electronics customers were not part of the transaction, as the electronics industry is one of BASF's strategic focus areas.
We sold the Coatings division's business with industrial coatings to the AkzoNobel Group on December 14, 2016. The transaction included technologies, patents, trademarks, customer relationships and inventories as well as the transfer of two production sites in England and in South Africa.

Business models and customer relations

Cost-effective
And reliable supplier of classic chemicals

Customized
With products and formulations for specific industries

Innovative
In close partnership with our customers

BASF's customer portfolio ranges from major global customers and medium-sized businesses to local workshops. We align our business models and sales channels with the respective customer groups and market segments. In line with our strategic principle, "We add value as one company," we tightly bundle our products and services to target the specific needs of customers from various sectors and bring innovations more quickly to market.
In the classical chemicals business, we mostly sell the chemicals produced in our Verbund in bulk. These comprise basic products from the Chemicals segment, such as steam cracker products, sulfuric acid, plasticizers, caprolactam and isocyanates. For these basic chemicals, our priority is on supplying customers reliably and cost effectively. Marketing is carried out partly via e-commerce.
We create a broad range of customized products, particularly in the Performance Products segment ­ from vitamins, personal care ingredients and color pigments to paper chemicals and plastic additives. In joint projects, we start working closely together with customers already at an early stage in order to develop new products or formulations for a specific industry. A worldwide network of development laboratories allows us to quickly adapt our products to local needs.
We offer functionalized materials and solutions tailored to customers' requirements, particularly in the Functional Materials & Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments. These include, for example, engineering plastics, concrete additives, coatings and crop protection products. We engage in close partnerships with customers and develop innovations together that help them optimize their processes and applications. Our understanding of the entire value chain as well as our global structure and market knowledge are key success factors here.
For information on customer relations in the Oil & Gas segment, see page 84 onward

Industry orientation
 Around half of business units geared toward specific industries
 Industry teams pool cross-unit expertise, knowledge and contacts
 Industry orientation undergoing systematic, structured enhancement
We serve customers from many different sectors with our broad portfolio of diverse competencies, processes, technol ogies and products. Around half of our business units are oriented toward industries. By combining expertise and resources, we position ourselves as a solution-oriented system provider for our customers.
Yet not all business units can be arranged purely according to industry. That is why BASF has created sector-specific groups for key customer industries ­ like the automotive, construction and pharmaceutical sectors ­ or for growth fields such as enzymes. These "industry teams" pool expertise, knowledge and contacts across different units, sharpen our understanding of the value chains in customer industries and work on sector-specific solutions that often could not be developed within one operating division alone. Our innovations are geared specifically toward these needs and offer sustainable solutions for the packaging and print branches, for example. This means combining the expertise of seven divisions into one global industry team. Whether keeping food fresh, manufacturing user-friendly packaging or optimizing costs ­ we know the needs of the industry. The products and systems developed by these teams comprise tailor-made solutions for paper packaging, along with adhesives and plastics for packaging or coatings. Our portfolio offers value to paper manufacturers in every phase of their production: Process chemicals optimize costs and increase machine efficiency, functional chemicals grant products special properties and finishing chemicals improve the appearance and performance of readyto-use paper and cardboard.
The close alignment of our business with our customers' needs is an important component of our "We create chemistry" strategy. We will therefore continue the systematic and structured enhancement of our industry orientation in the future.

To do so, we cultivate a working environment that inspires and connects people. It is founded on inclusive leadership based on mutual trust, respect and dedication to top performance.
Strategy
 Best Team Strategy focuses on excellent people, workplace and leaders
The Best Team Strategy is derived from our corporate strategy and contributes greatly to the achievement of our goals. We want to form the best team. To achieve this, we focus on three strategic directions: excellent people, excellent place to work and excellent leaders. Emphasis here is placed on our attractiveness in worldwide labor markets, personal and profess ional development, life-long learning, and supporting and developing our leaders. We are strongly committed to internationally recognized labor and social standards and strive to respect these worldwide.

Number of employees

At the end of 2016, BASF had 113,830 employees (2015: 112,435); of these, 3,120 were apprentices (2015: 3,240). We hired 6,957 new employees Group-wide in 2016. Moreover, the acquisition of Chemetall especially added to our workforce. Reductions in headcount were related to events such as the sale of the industrial coatings and polyolefin catalysts businesses.
The average percentage of employees who resigned during their first three years of employment was 1.2% worldwide in 2016. This turnover rate was 0.5% in Europe, 1.5% in North America, 3.2% in Asia Pacific and 1.9% in South America, Africa, Middle East. Our turnover rates are therefore lower than those of many other companies.

Competition for talent

Vocational training

 High scores in worldwide employer rankings  Focus on social media and online marketing

 3,120 apprentices in around 60 occupations worldwide  Around 104 million spent on vocational training

In the global competition for the best employees and leaders, we want to recruit qualified talent in order to achieve our ambi tious growth targets. This is why we continuously review measures to make our total offer package attractive for employe es. For example, we have now expanded our career website to include a total of 61 countries in 2016. We continue to make use of social networks to reach candidates and ensure an innovative, target-group-appropriate approach through digital media, such as 360-degree videos showcasing selected workspaces. In North America, our online campaign to make BASF an attractive employer for women and minorities was highly successful. We were able to attract and hire new employees for the Innovation Campus Asia Pacific in Shanghai, China, at our "Live Day" virtual career fair in Asia Pacific. In South America, we trained employees in the use of social media as ambassadors of our employee brand.
We were once again able to achieve high scores in e mployer rankings in 2016. For example, in a study conducted by Universum, BASF was again selected by engineering and IT students as one of the 50 most attractive employers in the world. In North America, BASF was listed among Forbes' 100 Best Employers for the second time in a row. We are also far ahead of our key competitors in North America on the employer rating website glassdoor.com. In Brazil, BASF was once again named one of the top 150 employers in a ranking by Você SA magazine.

As of December 31, 2016, BASF was training 3,120 people in 14 countries and around 60 occupations. We spent a total of around 104 million on vocational training in 2016, as well as about 6 million on the BASF Training Verbund as part of our social commitment in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.
In 2016, 837 apprentices started their vocational training at BASF SE and at German Group companies, filling almost all available program slots in Germany. The current shortage of skilled labor nevertheless presents a challenge that we a ddress with various initiatives. In the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan region, such programs include Start in den Beruf and Anlauf zur Ausbildung, in which 210 young people in the BASF Training Verbund participated in cooperation with partner companies in 2016. The goal here is to prepare participants for a subsequent apprenticeship within one year, making a contribution to the long-term supply of qualified employees in the region. B ecause the number of open vocational training placements meanwhile outweighs demand, some slots in these programs remained unfilled in 2016.
BASF launched its new apprenticeship campaign in May 2016, called "Show Us What You've Got!" (Zeig's Uns!). It underscores the fact that, for BASF, an applicant's overall impression is not made by technical know-how alone; personal interests and strengths like initiative, creativity and team spirit are also decisive factors.
At the Ludwigshafen site, we also offer a part-time training program for newcomers from other fields, so that they can qualify for a career in chemical production even while working at their current job.
The "Start Integration" program, begun with 50 placements in 2015, is geared toward refugees with a high probability of being granted the right to remain in Germany and aims to integrate them into the labor market in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region. BASF expanded the program to 300 placements and, for the 2016/2017 apprenticeship year, a dded three modules ­ include a one-year career prep course providing instruction in topics like language and intercultural training.

What we expect from our leaders

Learning and development

 Leaders as role models  Multifaceted offers for leadership development

Our leaders should be role models for applying our strategy in daily corporate life. We expect them to have a positive influence on shaping day-to-day business, relaying company values, and motivating employees. This includes how challenges are approached and how the leader's area of respon sibility is continuously developed. Our leadership culture is founded on BASF's strategic principles and values as well as on the standards of behavior set out by our global Code of Conduct.
We offer our leaders learning and development measures for all phases of their career, coordinating global, regional and local opportunities. These are geared toward strengthening our leaders' competencies and offer chances to network and learn from one another. For example, we began the European Emerging Leader program in 2016, which guides leadership candidates into their roles over a period of 1.5 years. Similar programs are available in other regions, too: In Asia Pacific, for example, we run an internal training and further development course for leaders to become coaches.

 Life-long learning concept focuses on on-the-job experience
 Specific further training for employees in production and technical areas
 Development meetings form important element of employee development
Learning and development are essential success factors for a strong company culture. The skills and competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth and lasting success. With the Best Team Strategy and regional learning strategies, we want to establish a new learning culture and enable life-long, self-guided learning. The learning and development options cover a range of learning goals: starting a career, expanding knowledge, personal development, and leadership training. For example, our Learning Campus in Singapore offers development programs for leaders and leadership candidates with a focus on strategy, leadership and innovation. It serves as a platform for new styles of learning and brings together employees from diverse areas ­ for our goal is to create a common-ground, inspiring learning experience that enables employees to connect with the company and with each other. In this regard, we have also been implementing the "MentForMe" mentoring program step by step since 2016. Our learning activities follow the "70-20-10" philosophy: We apply the elements "learning from experience" (70%), "learning from others" (20%) and "learning through courses and media" (10%).
We support employees in production and engineering worldwide with job-specific qualifications and further training. We have further strengthened our in-plant qualification measures with in-plant trainers who promote the continuous professional development of employees in production and engineering through individual learning assignments. Moreover, we expanded our programs on safety culture and knowledge management as well as team and organizational development.
We spent around 69 million on further training in 2016 (2015: 96 million). Each employee spent an average of 2.0 days on further training in 2016. As part of cost management, we decided in 2016 to focus training on business and safety- related courses.
In regular development meetings, held as part of our a nnual employee dialogs, employees and leaders outline prospects for individual professional development together and determine measures for further training and development. This model was implemented for around 78,150 employees by the end of 2016. We want to conduct development meetings for all employees by the end of 2017.

Managing demographic changes

Inclusion of diversity

 Leadership duties include "leadership in times of demographic change"

The demographic situation within the BASF Group varies widely by region. The aging population in areas like Germany and North America presents us with challenges. We are also occupied with future issues like new technologies, growing digitalization ("Industry 4.0"), and the ever-increasing delay of retirement. We create a framework to help maintain the employability of our personnel at all stages of life and ensure the availability of qualified employees. Employees and leaders are supported with health and exercise programs, flexible working arrangements, age-appropriate workplaces and demographic analyses. The topic "leadership in times of demographic change" also forms a part of our leadership programs. In addition, we engage in knowledge management and systematic succession planning.

 Promoting diversity as part of company culture  Global goals for increasing percentage of women in
leadership positions
We want to utilize diversity for the development of our business. Promoting diversity is one of the mainstays of our corporate culture. The strong global character of our markets translates into different customer requirements. We want to reflect this diversity in our workforce, as well, in order to even better understand the needs of our customers. The aim is to increase our teams' performance and power of innovation, and boost creativity, motivation and identification with the company. We are further promoting the appreciation and inclus ion of diversity. Leaders play an important role here. We support them in strengthening diversity and making the best possible use of it in day-to-day business. For example, specific goals and measures are being developed for such topics as recognizing and developing different kinds of talent.
Since 2015, BASF has set itself global quantitative goals for increasing the percentage of women in leadership positions. In the BASF Group, the global proportion of female leaders with disciplinary responsibility was 19.8% at the end of 2016 (2015: 19.5%). We aim to increase this figure to 22­24% worldwide by 2021, so that the proportion of women in leadership reflects that of women in the global company workforce.

2021 Goal
Proportion of women in leadership positions with disciplinary responsibility

22­24%

Considering the relatively low rate of turnover in the BASF Group's leadership team, this is an ambitious goal. Furthermore, BASF wants to continue increasing the global percentage of senior executives1 that come from countries other than Germany. This figure was at 36.4% by the end of 2016 (2015: 35.6%).
Moreover, we intend to maintain the proportion of senior executives with international experience at over 80%. We e xceeded this figure by the end of 2016, reaching 84.6%. With these goals, we continue to drive our globally integrated approach to promoting diversity and leadership development.

Our identity as an employer includes our belief in supporting our employees worldwide in balancing their personal and professional lives. Through various offers and opportunities, we create working conditions that give fair consideration to our employees' individual needs. We want to strengthen their identification with the company and bolster our position as an attractive employer in the competition for qualified personnel. Our offer includes flexible working hours, part-time employment and mobile working. In 2016, a total of 12.0% of BASF SE employees held part-time positions, of which 69.9% were women. Numerous employees also made use of parental leave.

 Pay generally comprises fixed and variable components plus benefits
In addition to market-oriented compensation, BASF's total offer also comprises benefits, individual opportunities for developm ent and a good working environment. Our employees' pay is based on global compensation principles. These take into account an employee's position and individual performance as well as the company's success. Representative analyses of the Ludwigshafen site have shown that there are no systematic differences in pay between men and women, provided the positions and qualifications are comparable. As a rule, compensation is comprised of fixed and variable components as well as benefits that often exceed legal requirements. In many countries, these include company pension benefits, supplementary health insurance, and share programs.
In 2016, the BASF Group spent 10,165 million on wages and salaries, social security contributions and expenses for pensions and assistance (2015: 9,982 million). This represents growth of 1.8% in personnel expenses, primarily as a result of expenses for the long-term incentive program as well as wage and salary increases. Partly countering this rise was the lower average number of employees, in addition to currency effects.
For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 188

Our regional initiatives specifically address the needs of our employees at a local level. Our Work-Life Management e mployee center in Ludwigshafen ("LuMit"), provides opportunities for fitness and health, employee assistance, and balancing career and personal life ­ like the company childcare center, "LuKids," which offers daycare for 250 children. Around 600 employees take advantage of LuMit every day. We also provide social counseling at other sites in Germany, such as those in Münster and Schwarzheide, as well as in Asia, South Africa and North America, to help employees overcome difficult life situations and maintain their employability.

The Global Employee Survey and its follow-up process have been established for the entire BASF Group ever since the first survey in 2008. It was last conducted in 2015. Employees and leaders discussed the results together in all regions, and are now implementing improvement measures. This pertains to topics such as supporting employees in their career development, intensifying feedback, or supporting leaders and their teams in driving change and innovation. We conduct the Global Employee Survey at regular intervals; the next one is scheduled for 2018.

Employees participate in the company's success Global labor and social standards

 Return on assets determines variable compensation  "plus" share program fosters employees' long-term
participation in company
With variable compensation components, we involve employees in the company's success and reward individual performance. The same principles basically apply for all employees. The amount of the variable component is determined by the company's economic success (measured by the return on assets1 of the BASF Group) as well as the employee's individual performance. Individual performance is assessed as part of a globally consistent performance management process.
In numerous Group companies, employees are offered the chance to purchase shares. The BASF share program "plus" sponsors employees' long-term participation in the company through incentive shares: By investing a portion of their compensation in BASF shares, they take part in the long-term developm ent of BASF.
BASF offers its executives the opportunity to participate in a share-price-based compensation program. This long-term incentive (LTI) program ties a portion of their compensation to the long-term performance of BASF shares. In 2016, 92% of the approximately 1,200 eligible executives worldwide participated in the LTI program, investing up to 30% of their variable compensation in BASF shares.
For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 216 onward
Dialog with employee representatives
Open dialog with employee representatives is an important component of our corporate culture. If restructuring leads to staff downsizing, for example, we work with employee representatives to develop socially responsible implementation measures. This is done in accordance with the respective legal regulations and the agreements reached. The BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) addresses cross-border matters in Europe.
Together with employee representatives, we continued to elaborate on the future topics described by the company and works council in the BASF SE 2020 site agreement in 2016. For example, new principles for promoting apprentices were described in BASF SE's "Apprenticeship of the Future." We are engaged in close exchange with employee representatives on the topic of changes through increasing digitalization in order to identify and jointly address challenges.
For more information, see basf.com/employeerepresentation

 Alignment with U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
 Adjusted management process for monitoring adherence to labor and social standards
Our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor and social standards is embedded in our global Code of Conduct. This encompasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). BASF strives to uphold these standards worldwide. We mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including external compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations), and the global management process for the respect of international labor norms.
In 2016, we continued the restructuring of our management process begun in 2015. In the previous year, a global team of experts had already drafted a Group-wide BASF guideline on complying with international labor and social standards2. This provided the basis for developing a process that determines potential gaps in complying with these standards. The management process will now be implemented successively around the world. A monitoring system launched in 2016 keeps track of the situation in countries in which BASF is active, and regularly reviews the implementation of set goals and measures. We performed a risk-based analysis of 43 countries by the end of 2016. The remaining countries are scheduled to be reviewed in 2017.

We take on social responsibility: We are involved in diverse projects worldwide, especially in the communities where our sites are located. Our main focus is on life-long learning and access to education. In this way, we promote innovative capacity and future viability.
Strategy

In 2016, we revamped our activities in terms of social commitment and designed them to have an even greater impact. The Social Engagement Strategy serves as our launchpad ­ we use this to strengthen our global approach to the topic. The strategy revolves around support projects having a lasting impact on society and offering learning opportunities for participating cooperation partners and BASF. The common thread throughout all worldwide social commitment activities is provided by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Regional emphasis topics help us tailor our engagement toward local needs.
The BASF Group spent a total of 47.0 million supporting projects in 2016; we donated 49.6% of this amount (2015: 56.2 million, 46% of which were donations). The decline in comparison with 2015 is attributable to the previous year's individual special projects in honor of BASF's anniversary. We support initiatives that reach out to as many people as possible and have long-term impact. We foster education, science, social projects, arts and culture, and sports in the communities around our sites. On a regional level, we work together with universities, schools and nonprofit organizations. We support BASF Stiftung, a charitable foundation, in its international projects with various U.N. and nongovernmental organizations.

Two pillars of social commitment
In its Social Engagement Strategy, BASF combines two pillars under one roof: donations and the company's own nonprofit activities (Corporate Citizenship) along with business-oriented projects (Starting Ventures).
Corporate Citizenship activities aim to help create a livable surrounding region for our sites' neighbors, employees and families. This means supporting numerous projects like the "Connected to Care" program begun in 2015. Employees around the world form teams to carry out volunteer projects together with nonprofit organizations.
With our Starting Venture program, we develop entrepreneurial solutions to support low-income demographic groups in emerging markets in their efforts to improve their quality of life. We achieve this through projects in various customer industries and regions that aim to increase employment o pportunities and improve access to products. For example, BASF supports young people from low-infrastructure urban areas in Chile with occupational training in the field of auto motive coatings. 75 young people have achieved certification so far and are now in a position to take up employment at our customers. The Starting Venture program thus also contributes to our long-term business success.
BASF Stiftung
The BASF Stiftung, a nonprofit organization, supported a school nutrition project of the United Nations World Food Programme in Colombia in 2016 as part of its humanitarian development work. There, healthy school meals are an important motivation for students ­ especially from low-income families ­ to attend school. The project also collaborates with small-holder farmers who supply the participating schools with groceries. The small-holder farmers are given specific training in advance.
In the 2016 year-end donation campaign, the company and its employees gave around 337,000 to BASF Stiftung, which is using the sum to support a World Food Programme initiative to improve living conditions for people in Ethiopia.

The global economy grew only moderately in 2016 but was subject to regional fluctuations. While growth in the emerging markets remained almost unchanged in comparison with 2015, it decelerated in the industrialized countries due to the U.S. economy's initially weak d ynamic. In the European Union, growth in gross domestic product was just marginally below the previous year's level despite the heightened uncertainty before and after the British referendum on leaving the E.U. Gross domestic product in China grew only slightly more slowly thanks to governmental economic measures. Overall, global gross domestic product grew by 2.3%, as we had anticipated, remaining behind the level of 2015 (+2.7%). The average price for a barrel of Brent blend crude oil fell to $44 per barrel (2015: $52 per barrel).

Trends in the global economy in 2016

Economic trends by region

The global economic environment was marked in 2016 by expansive monetary policy, low raw materials prices that nevertheless stabilized over the course of the year, and a modest growth dynamic. The especially low price of oil during the first half of the year dampened growth in the oil-producing countries and reduced the propensity to invest there, including the United States. Small levels of inflation, historically low interest rates and a weak euro supported growth in Europe.
The currencies of many emerging economies that export raw materials were weaker than in the previous year, but apprec iated considerably over the course of 2016. This was due in part to a gradual rise in oil and precious metal prices in addition to the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious interest rate policy. Economic uncertainty increased considerably as the year progressed, largely as an effect of the British vote to exit the E.U., but also because of continuing geopolitical conflicts and unpredictability before and after the U.S. presidential elections.

 Economic growth somewhat slower in the E.U.  Weaker growth in the U.S.  Slowdown in China lighter than expected; 
stable growth in emerging markets of Asia  Further decline of GDP in South America
In 2016, growth in the European Union's gross domestic product slowed slightly, from 2.2% in 2015 to 1.9%. Development in the region continued to be marked by widely divergent trends in 2016: In northwestern Europe, growth rates remained at a solid level overall. In the United Kingdom, the increase in gross domestic product slackened only marginally after the referendum on a British exit from the E.U. Germany's eco nomic growth was at a comparatively robust 1.8% while that of France was more moderate, at 1.1%. In southwestern Europe, Spain continued its dynamic pace (+3.2%). By contrast, Italy (+1.0%) and Portugal (+1.4%) were not able to boost their economies to such a considerable extent. The central and eastern E.U. countries also boasted above- average growth (+2.8%), helped along by low inflation rates, ongoing low unemployment levels and the stable development of e xports. In Russia, the economy shrank only slightly (­0.2%) after the previous year's sharp decline (­2.8%), partly thanks to the stabilization in oil prices over the course of the year.

48 Management's Report
The BASF Group business year -- Economic environment 

BASF Report 2016

Growth in the United States during the first two quarters was considerably below the average for the year. Reasons included weak investment activity in the oil industry and cyclical inventory effects. Private consumption bolstered the economy. In the second half of the year, growth picked up thanks to increased investment and positive development in agricultural exports. Overall, the U.S. economy grew by only 1.6% in 2016 (2015: +2.6%), remaining behind its medium-term pace of around 2%.
Economic output in the emerging markets of Asia saw a somewhat slower increase as compared with the previous year (2016: +6.0%, 2015: +6.3%). This was largely attributable to the only slightly slower growth in China (2016: +6.7%; 2015: +6.9%). The construction and automotive industries benefited from government investments as well as impetus provided by monetary and fiscal policy. In this environment, the neighboring Asian countries grew at a relatively stable rate; India once again saw rapid expansion, at 6.8% (2015: +7.9%).
At 1.0%, growth remained modest in Japan. The appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar (around 10% compared with the previous year) and lower demand from China reduced both the year's average exports and private companies' propensity to invest. Lower imports, weakly growing private consumption, expanding housing investment and public expen ditures compensated for these negative effects, so that the Japanese economy's overall growth was about as strong as in the previous year.
Gross domestic product shrank once again in South America, by 2.5% (2015: ­1.8%). Economic performance in Brazil remained 3.4% behind the previous year (2015: ­3.8%). Gross domestic product declined in Argentina, as well, shrinking by 2.3% against the backdrop of high inflation and fiscal consolidation measures (2015: +2.6%). Venezuela and Ecuador suffered from the low price of crude oil; gross domestic product declined in both countries. The other countries in the region grew moderately on average.
Trends in key customer industries
 Global industrial production increases at rate similar to 2015
 Development in key customer industries improves on average
Global industrial production grew by around 1.9% in 2016, about the same as in the previous year (+2.0%). Growth in the advanced economies slowed slightly (2016: +0.8%, 2015: +1.0%) but remained constant in the emerging markets (2016: +3.0%, 2015: +3.0%).
Industrial growth in the European Union increased marginally to 1.4% from 1.3%. In the United States, industrial production nearly stagnated (2016: +0.3%; 2015: +1.3%). At 5.5%, industrial growth in the emerging markets of Asia roughly

matched the prior year's level. Industry in China cooled down only slightly, thanks to governmental stimulus. The recession continued in South America: Industrial production shrank in Brazil by 6.0% (2015: ­8.2%).
The chemical industry's key customer sectors developed better on average than industrial production. Global auto motive production grew by 4.5%, outpacing the previous year. In western Europe and North America, the sector continued its economic upswing. Tax incentives in China boosted d emand; however, production fell drastically in South America and Russia. The global rate of growth in the construction industry was 2.8%, down from the previous year's +3.5%. In western E urope, construction saw slightly higher growth than in 2015; in the eastern countries of the European Union, the expiration of E.U. funding programs led to decreased activity. Growth in the United States slowed considerably. In China, construction volumes rose at around the same rate as 2015 as a result of governmental support measures. Globally, agriculture grew by 1.4%, behind the level in previous years; production weakened in South America especially.

Trends in the chemical industry

Important raw material price developments

 Global growth corresponds to our expectations

The chemical industry (excluding pharmaceuticals) grew at the rate we had anticipated, by 3.4%. The fastest growth was seen in chemical production in the emerging markets of Asia (2016: +6.3%, 2015: +6.6%). Chemical production increased only marginally in the Europ ean Union (2016: +0.4%, 2015: +0.9%). There were substantial regional differences. Production fell considerably in Belgium and the United Kingdom, while the Netherlands saw a sharp increase. Chemical production declined slightly in Germany. Growth in the United States was weaker than in the previous year (2016: +0.6%, 2015: +1.9%1). Thanks to significant production expansion in Mexico, overall growth for North America shrank at a slower rate (2016: +0.9%, 2015: +1.8%). South America saw a marginal decline in chemical production (2016: -0.8%, 2015: -3.8%). Production volumes grew slightly in Japan, at 1.5% (2015: +1.6%).

Averaging around $44 per barrel in 2016, the price of Brent blend crude oil dropped by about 15% compared with the previous year ($52 per barrel). The oil price fluctuated over the course of the year between $31 per barrel in January and $54 per barrel in December.
The average monthly price for the chemical raw material naphtha ranged over the course of 2016 between $293 per metric ton in February and $462 per metric ton in December. At $385 per metric ton, the annualized average price of naphtha in 2016 was below the level of 2015 ($462 per metric ton).
The average price of gas in the United States was $2.49 per mmBtu, under the previous year's level ($2.61 per mmBtu). In Europe, the average price of gas on spot markets remained substantially higher, at $4.58 per mmBtu (2015: $6.49 per mmBtu). Gas prices in China averaged around $6.54 per mmBtu nationally (2015: $9.81 per mmBtu), while the average price in the coastal regions was $7.72 per mmBtu (2015: $11.20 per mmBtu).

The BASF Group business year -- Results of operations 

BASF Report 2016

Results of operations

In 2016, our market environment continued to be volatile and challenging; the global economy and the chemical indust ry saw slower growth. Overall, BASF Group business developments unfolded in line with our expectations. We posted a considerable sales decline compared with the previous year and a slightly lower income from operations (EBIT) before special items. These developments were largely the result of the divestitures completed in 2015 as well as price declines due to further drops in raw material prices. Increased sales volumes and reduced fixed costs helped counter this effect, even allowing us to achieve considerably higher EBIT before special items in the chemicals business1.
Business reviews by segment can be found from page 59 onward
Sales
 Sales down 18% to 57,550 million
Sales for 2016 decreased by 12,899 million to 57,550 million. This was mainly attributable to the divestiture of the gas trading and storage business as part of the asset swap with Gazprom at the end of September 2015. This business had contributed 10.1 billion to sales in 2015. In addition, lower oil, gas and other raw material prices led to a drop in sales prices, reducing sales in the chemicals business ­ especially the Chemicals segment ­ as well as in the Oil & Gas segment. We were able to continually raise sales volumes over the course of the year, and achieved slight volumes growth overall. Volumes grew slightly in the Chemicals, Performance Products and Oil & Gas segments. The Functional Materials & Solutions segment posted a significant increase, and Agricultural Solutions a slight decrease. Currency effects slightly dampened sales.

Income from operations
 EBIT before special items 6% below 2015 level, at 6,309 million
 At 6,275 million, EBIT matches prior-year level  EBIT after cost of capital rises considerably
At 6,309 million, income from operations (EBIT) before special items was 430 million below the level of the previous year. This was largely a consequence of the considerable decline in the Oil & Gas segment resulting mainly from falling prices and the divestiture of the natural gas trading and storage business. The activities transferred to Gazprom had contribu ted around 260 million to EBIT before special items in 2015. In the Agricultural Solutions segment, EBIT before special items matched the previous year's level. We achieved a considerable increase in the chemicals business thanks to sharply improved contributions from the Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.
For an explanation of the figure EBIT before special items, see page 28

2016 2015 2014 2013 2012

6,309 6,739 7,357 7,077 6,647

Special items in EBIT amounted to minus 34 million in 2016, compared with minus 491 million in the previous year.
This development was mainly due to the special items recognized in other charges and income, which amounted to m inus 44 million in 2016. In the previous year, other charges and income totaled minus 729 million, mostly comprising impairments on assets in the Oil & Gas segment.
Special charges from various restructuring measures came out to minus 394 million compared with minus 223 million in the previous year.
Divestitures in 2016 resulted in an earnings contribution of 431 million, after 476 million in the previous year, especially from the sale of the industrial coatings business and the polyolefin catalysts business in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment.
Integration costs for acquired businesses amounted to 27 million, compared with 15 million in 2015.

At 6,275 million, EBIT for the BASF Group in 2016 matched the level of the previous year (2015: 6,248 million). Included in this figure is income from companies accounted for using the equity m ethod, which rose from 251 million to 307 million.

We once again earned a premium on our cost of capital in 2016. EBIT after cost of capital amounted to 1,136 million compared with 194 million in the previous year. The cost of capital fell by 809 million year-on-year. In addition to the reduction of the cost of capital percentage by one percentage point, this was primarily the result of the lower level of tied-up capital in inventories and operating receivables.
For an explanation of the figure EBIT after cost of capital, see page 28 The calculation of EBIT as part of our income statement is shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 155

 Financial result considerably below, and net income slightly above, prior year
 Earnings per share rise from 4.34 to 4.42
The financial result fell to minus 880 million in 2016, compared with minus 700 million in the previous year.
Income from shareholdings decreased from 9 million in 2015 to minus 17 million, predominantly due to lower income from the disposal of shareholdings.
The interest result declined from minus 425 million in 2015 to minus 482 million. This was predominantly from lower interest income, especially from investments in liquid funds, and higher interest expenses in connection with new bank loans outside of the eurozone.
Other financial result fell from minus 284 million in the previous year to minus 381 million in 2016, due mostly to the decline in interest payments capitalized as construction period interest and higher currency hedging costs.
Income before taxes and minority interests dipped from 5,548 million in 2015 to 5,395 million in 2016.
Income taxes were reduced from 1,247 million in 2015 to 1,140 million in 2016. At 21.1%, the tax rate was below the prior year's level (22.5%) primarily as a result of currency- related deferred tax income in Norway, whereas the previous year had included currency-related deferred tax expenses.
Income before minority interests decreased from 4,301 million to 4,255 million. Minority interests amounted to 199 million, compared with 314 million in 2015.
At 4,056 million, net income exceeded the previous year's level of 3,987 million. Earnings per share increased from 4.34 to 4.42.

Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) and income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are figures that describe operational performance independent of age-related amortization and depreciation of assets and extrao rdinary valuation allowances (impairments or write-ups). Both figures are therefore particularly useful in cross-company comparisons. EBITDA before special items is also highly useful in making comparisons over time.
At 10,327 million, EBITDA before special items in 2016 was down by 181 million compared with the previous year; EBITDA amounted to 10,526 million, or 123 million below the level of 2015.

Compared with earnings per share, this figure has been adjusted for special items as well as amortization of, and valuation allowances (impairments and write-ups) on, intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following acquisitions. The amortization of intangible assets is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on minority interests are also eliminated. This makes adjusted earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting future profitability.
In 2016, adjusted earnings per share amounted to 4.83 compared with 5.00 in the previous year.

For earnings, "slight" means a change of 1­10%, while "considerable" is used for changes of 11% and higher. "At prior-year level" indicates no change (+/­0%).

Actual development compared with outlook for 2016
In 2016, BASF Group sales and EBIT before special items developed in line with our forecast: Sales declined considerably and EBIT before special items was slightly below the level of 2015. We just barely missed the volumes growth expected in all segments excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures: In the Agricultural Solutions segment, volumes were slightly down, while they rose as anticipated in the chemicals business2 and the Oil & Gas segment. EBIT did not decline slightly as forecast, but rather matched the prior-year level. This was largely the result of special income from the divestitures completed in 2016 in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment. The earnings contribution from the chemicals business increased considerably in 2016, counter to our assumption that it would slightly d ecline. Mainly because of this, BASF Group EBIT after cost of capital rose considerably rather than decreasing considerably as we had expected.
Sales in the Chemicals segment fell considerably in 2016, whereas we had expected the decline to be slight. Increased volumes were able to partly offset for the sharp drop in prices, but less so than we had foreseen. For EBIT before special items, we observed only a slight, rather than considerable, year-on-year decline, essentially through the higher margins for isocyanates in the Monomers division.
Contrary to our expectations, sales in the Performance Products segment were slightly below the previous year's level instead of matching it. Volumes growth was less able than we had anticipated to offset price declines and negative portfolio and currency effects. EBIT before special items rose not only slightly, but rather considerably, in the Performance Products segment. In addition to significantly reduced fixed costs thanks to restructuring measures and strict cost management, improved margins also contributed to this development.

In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we were able to raise sales volumes in all divisions in 2016, more than compensating for price and currency effects. As a result, sales were not at the same level of the previous year, as forecast, but rose slightly instead. EBIT before special items likewise exceeded our expectations, with a considerable rather than slight increase.
For the Agricultural Solutions segment, we had anticipated slight growth in both sales and EBIT before special items. Due especially to dampened demand for insecticides in South America and fungicides in Europe, however, we posted a slight decrease in sales volumes instead of the expected increase. Negative currency effects also dampened sales. Through strict cost management, EBIT before special items reached the prior year's level despite the slight decline in sales.
In the Oil & Gas segment, sales and EBIT before special items fell considerably as expected. We expanded our production volumes in 2016 in line with our forecast.
Sales in Other declined considerably, corresponding to our expectations. EBIT before special items, however, was considerably below rather than considerably above the level of the previous year. This was largely attributable to valuation e ffects for our long-term incentive program.
In 2016, we invested a total of 3.9 billion in capital expen ditures3, less than the anticipated level of around 4.2 billion. Investments in the Oil & Gas and Performance Products segments in particular were below the values considered in our planning.

Assets
 Rise in both current and noncurrent assets  Noncurrent assets especially boosted by Chemetall
acquisition
Amounting to 76,496 million, the level of total assets was 5,660 million above that of the previous year.
Noncurrent assets rose by 4,280 million to 50,550 million. The 2,625 million increase in intangible assets was mainly due to the Chemetall acquisition. Additions amounted to 2,881 million, 1,552 million of which was goodwill. Currency effects increased intangible assets by 409 million. Amortization1 reduced them by 560 million and disposals by 91 million.
The value of property, plant and equipment rose by 1,153 million to 26,413 million. Additions amounted to 4,377 million, 4,222 million of which was to investments, putting them above the level of depreciation1, which amounted to 3,691 million. Additions from acquisitions amounted to 155 million and arose especially from the Chemetall acquisition. Currency effects increased property, plant and equipment by 570 million. Disposals reduced this item by 242 million, 97 million of which was attributable to divestitures.
Investments accounted for using the equity method rose by 211 million to 4,647 million, primarily as a result of additions and currency effects.

Other financial assets increased by 79 million to 605 million and deferred tax assets rose by 722 million to 2,513 million, especially from the increase in provisions for pensions and similar obligations.
Other receivables and miscellaneous assets were down by 510 million to 1,210 million year-on-year. This was largely the result of a decline in the positive fair value of derivatives and lower receivables from loans as well as a lower level of defined benefit assets.
The value of current assets rose by 1,380 million to 25,946 million. The 1,436 million increase in trade accounts receivable resulted mainly from higher year-on-year sales in the fourth quarter as well as from currency effects. Inventories grew by 312 million; other receivables and miscellaneous assets fell by 17 million. With the acquisition of Chemetall on December 14, 2016, these three items increased by 276 million. Marketable securities rose by 515 million due to the optimization of short-term financial investments.
At 1,375 million, cash and cash equivalents were 866 million below the level of December 31, 2015.

Equity and liabilities
 Equity ratio at 42.6%, compared with 44.5% in previous year
 Net debt rises from 12,935 million to 14,401 million
Equity rose by 1,023 million to 32,568 million compared with the previous year. Retained earnings increased by 1,395 million to 31,515 million. Other comprehensive income was reduced by 493 million to minus 4,014 million, primarily because of the remeasurement of defined benefit plans. The equity ratio was 42.6% (2015: 44.5%).
Compared with the end of 2015, noncurrent liabilities grew by 3,556 million to 28,611 million. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations increased by 1,896 million, mainly as a result of the reduced discount rate in all relevant currency zones. Noncurrent financial indebtedness rose by 1,422 million. A bond issued in 2013 with a maturity until 2021 was tapped, increasing its volume by 300 million to 1 billion; in addition, new bonds in EUR, GBP and HKD were issued with an equivalent value totaling 2.6 billion at the end of the year and maturities between 4 and 15 years, in part to finance the acquisition of Chemetall. Four bonds in EUR and GBP due in 2017 with an equivalent value totaling around 1.4 billion were reclassified to current financial indebtedness. Other provisions rose by 298 million while other liabilities matched the prior- year level. Deferred taxes decreased by 64 million.

Current liabilities grew by 1,081 million to 15,317 million. All items contributed to this development, with the exception of financial indebtedness. Trade accounts payable increased by 590 million, current provisions by 262 million, tax liabilities by 206 million and current other liabilities by 330 million. Current financial indebtedness fell by 307 million. This was largely on account of the 681 million year-on-year decrease in outstanding U.S. dollar commercial paper as of December 31, 2016, as well as the scheduled repayment of EUR bonds totaling 900 million. The previously mentioned reclassification of bonds had a counterbalancing effect.
In total, financial indebtedness grew by 1,115 million to 16,312 million. The average maturity of our financial indebted ness was 5.6 years (2015: 5.2 years). Net debt grew by 1,466 million to 14,401 million. This is calculated by subtracting marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents from current and noncurrent financial indebtedness. This balance-related indicator provides information on effective indebtedness.

Financing policy and credit ratings
 Financing principles remain unchanged  "A" ratings confirmed
Our financing policy is aimed at ensuring our solvency at all times, limiting the risks associated with financing and opti mizing our cost of capital. We preferably meet our external financing needs on international capital markets.
We strive to maintain at least a solid "A" rating, which a llows us unrestricted access to money and capital markets. Our financing measures are aligned with our operative business planning as well as the company's strategic direction and also ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic options.

We have solid financing. Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our 20 billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile and diverse range of investors, and to optimize our debt capital financing conditions.
For short-term financing, we use BASF SE's U.S. dollar commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5 billion. On December 31, 2016, $1,089 million worth of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. Firmly committed, syndicated credit lines of 6 billion serve to cover the repayment of outstanding commercial p aper, and can also be used for general company purposes.
These credit lines were not used at any point in 2016. Our external financing is therefore largely independent of shortterm fluctuations in the credit markets.

BASF has good credit ratings, especially in comparison with competitors in the chemical industry. Rating agency Moody's last confirmed their rating of "A1/P-1/outlook stable" on N ovember 28, 2016. Standard & Poor's adjusted their BASF rating from "A+/A-1/outlook negative" to "A/A-1/outlook stable" on March 14, 2016, and confirmed it most recently on August 10, 2016. This adjustment was largely based on the weaker market environment, especially for basic and agricultural chemicals, limited overall volumes growth, and the considerable drop in the price of crude oil. Uncertainty with regard to economic development in China was taken into consideration, as well. Rating agency Scope has also been evaluating our creditworthiness since September 2016. They rated BASF at "A/S-1/outlook stable."

Off-balance-sheet financing tools, such as leasing, are of minor importance to us. BASF Group's most important financial contracts contain no side agreements with regard to specific financial ratios (financial covenants) or compliance with a specific rating (rating trigger).
For more on the financing tools used, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 208 onward
To minimize risks and exploit internal optimization potential within the Group, we bundle the financing, financial investments and foreign currency hedging of BASF SE's subsidiaries within the BASF Group where possible. Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged centrally by means of derivative financial instruments in the market.
Our interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing interest expenses for the Group and limiting interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital markets from fixed interest to variable rate or vice versa.

Statement of Cash Flows
 Cash provided by operating activities significantly, and free cash flow slightly, down year-on-year
At 7,717 million, cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was 1,729 million below the level of the previous year. Contributing to this was the lower year-on-year level of cash inflow from changes in net working capital, which contains changes in inventories and receivables as well as in operating liabilities and other provisions. This resulted primarily from the targeted reduction of inventories in 2015. Miscellaneous items especially included the transfer of disposal gains into cash used in investing activities. In 2015, this item had primarily included the reclassification of gains from the asset swap with Gazprom.
Cash used in investing activities amounted to 6,490 million in 2016 compared with 5,235 million in 2015. Payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were at 4,145 million, below both the prior year's level (5,812 million) and the level of amortization and depreciation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and financial assets (4,291 million).
Acquisitions and divestitures in 2016 resulted in net payments made of 2,164 million compared with 436 million in net payments received in 2015. The acquisition of Chemetall was primarily responsible.
Cash outflow of 181 million from financial assets and other items in 2016 was mainly attributable to the acquisition of marketable securities. In 2015, the decline in loan receivables in particular had led to 141 million in payments received.
For more on investments and acquisitions, see page 37 onward

Cash used in financing activities amounted to 2,160 million in 2016, compared with 3,673 million in the previous year. Contributions from minority interests to capital increases in Group companies led to a cash inflow of 28 million in 2016. Changes in financial liabilities resulted in cash inflow of 579 million. This was largely the result of issuing new bonds as well as of tapping an existing bond; the scheduled repayment of three bonds and scaling back BASF SE's U.S. dollar commercial paper program both had a counterbalancing effect. In 2016, dividends of 2,664 million were paid to shareholders of BASF SE and 103 million to minority interests.
Cash and cash equivalents fell by 933 million, amounting to 1,375 million as of December 31, 2016.
Free cash flow, which is what remains after subtracting payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash provided by operating activities, fell to 3,572 million compared with 3,634 million in 2015. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was nearly offset by lower payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

How we create value ­ an example

Biomass Balance Approach A groundbreaking way of using renewable resources in the Verbund

Value for BASF

Value for our customers and the environment

Externally certified products since introduction

>40

Increased use of renewable in place of fossil raw m aterials per product

100% up to

Since 2013, we have been in a position to flexibly replace fossil resources in our current Verbund system with sustainably generated bio-based raw materials by feeding raw materials like biogas or bionaphtha right into the beginning of the value chain. The method is independently certified1 and can be used in existing production facilities. Based on their formulations, we can already allocate and certify the proportion of biomass in more than 40 sales products. Extensions to this portfolio can be accomplished within a short amount of time and enable us to quickly react to growing interest in the use of renewable resources.
For more on the biomass balance approach, see page 94

The approach can be applied to many of our products and adjusted to customer specifications. Up to 100% of a product's fossil raw materials can be replaced by sustainably produced biomass while retaining identical product quality. Some of the products already certified include dispersions, superabsorbents and plastics. The certification makes it easier for our customers to place products on the market that have been produced with the help of renewable resources.

Strategy

 Integrated production facilities form core of Verbund  Technology and cost leadership provide most
important competitive edge
With its production facilities, the Chemicals segment is at the heart of the Verbund structure and supplies BASF's segments with basic chemicals for the production of downstream products. We add value with innovations in processes and production, and invest in future markets to ensure the growth of the entire BASF Verbund. As a reliable supplier, we market our products to customers in downstream industries. We continually improve our value chains and are expanding our market position ­ particularly outside Europe ­ with new processes and technologies, as well as through investments and collaborations in future markets.

We invest in research and development in order to develop new technologies and to make our existing technologies even more efficient. Cost leadership and a clear orientation along individual value chains are among our most important competitive advantages. We concentrate on the critical success factors of the classical chemicals business: making use of economies of scale, the advantages of our Verbund, high c apacity utilization, continuous optimization of access to raw materials, lean processes, and reliable, cost-effective logistics. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our global production structures and aligning these with regional market requirements.
In Ludwigshafen, we will strengthen the Verbund by replacing our acetylene plant, which occupies a central role for many products and value chains, with a modern, highly efficient plant by 2019.

Chemicals segment
 Sales decrease by 8% to 13,461 million, due to lower prices
 Decline in EBIT before special items by 4% to 2,064 million mainly owing to higher fixed costs
In the Chemicals segment, sales to third parties decreased by 1,209 million in 2016 to 13,461 million (volumes 3%, prices ­11%, portfolio 0%, currencies 0%). The reason for this were lower prices as a result of slumped raw material prices, especially in the Petrochemicals division. We were able to raise our volumes overall.
Income from operations (EBIT) before special items fell by 92 million to 2,064 million, mainly because of higher fixed costs from new production plant startups. Lower margins in the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions also dampened EBIT before special items; higher margins for isocyanates in the Monomers division helped slow the decline. EBIT decreased by 148 million to 1,983 million. Special charges came mainly from the overhaul of caprolactam production in Europe.

about by raw material prices that were significantly below prior-y ear levels, especially in the first half of the year. Production was resumed at the Ellba C.V. joint operation plant in Moerdijk, Netherlands, enabling us to slightly increase overall sales volumes. In North America, volumes decreased mainly as a result of lower plant capacity utilization of the condensate splitter as well as of unscheduled shutdowns of the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas.

positively, however, for steam cracker products in Asia and for ethylene oxide and glycols in Europe, largely driven by product scarcity on the market in the first half of the year.
Monomers
 Sales decrease by 6% to 5,745 million, mainly on account of lower prices
 EBIT before special items considerably higher as a result of increased isocyanate margins
In the Monomers division, sales to third parties declined by 348 million to 5,745 million in 2016. This was basically the result of lower sales prices brought about by a drop in raw material costs, which particularly weighed down sales in the polyamide value chain. By contrast, prices increased for isocyanates.
Volumes growth for isocyanates was able to more than compensate for the decline in the caprolactam business; sales volumes grew slightly as a result.

Compared with 2015, sales to third parties decreased by 168 million to 2,681 million in the Intermediates division. Sales prices fell once again, due to a sharp drop in raw material prices. In the butanediol and derivatives market, intense competitive pressure from the startup of new capacities in Asia additionally weighed down prices.
We were able to raise our volumes overall, predominantly driven by higher sales volumes of amines in North America and of polyalcohols, especially neopentylglycol, in Asia.

Increased margins for isocyanates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016, led to a considerable increase in EBIT before special items. They were able to more than offset lower margins in the polyamide value chain as well as the higher fixed costs arising from the startup of new production plants. Special charges came mainly from the overhaul of capro lactam production in Europe.
In August 2016, we began production at the TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and started supplying customers for the first time. The plant's gradual startup had begun in November 2015. Owing to a technical defect in November 2016, the TDI plant was still undergoing repair at the time of this report's publication.

EBIT before special items in 2016 was considerably below the previous year's level. This was mainly the result of substantially shrunken margins in the butanediol and derivatives b usiness. Slowing the decline were improved margins in the polyalcohols business. Fixed costs rose year-on-year, mainly as a result of several production plants beginning operation in the second half of 2015. Special charges resulted predominantly from impairments on assets.
We expanded our butanediol capacities in Geismar, Louisiana, in 2016. With our partner PETRONAS, we started up a plant for 2-ethylhexanoic acid in Kuantan, Malaysia; in Korla, China, we have been producing polytetrahydrofuran (PolyTHF®) since July 2016 with our partner Markor.

How we create value ­ an example

Ingredients from RSPO-certified palm kernel oil Attracting customers as a reliable supplier and supporting more sustainable cultivation

Value for BASF

Value for our customers and the environment

In 2016, purchase of certified palm kernel oil increased

to 158,000 metric tons

Number of RSPO-certified p roduction sites worldwide

19

The sustainable cultivation of renewable raw materials is gaining in importance. Our customers in the cosmetic and detergents and cleaners industries are therefore increasingly making use of ingredients containing palm kernel oil that has been certified according to the criteria of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The availability of certified palm kernel oil is limited. And yet we were able to expand our purchasing volumes by around 32,000 to 158,000 metric tons in 2016, nearly doubling sales of certified products based on palm kernel oil. This allows us to meet increasing demand and participate in actively shaping the evolving market.

With a total of 19 RSPO-certified production sites on four continents, we offer our customers a secure supply worldwide, helping them fulfill the obligations they took on for sustainable palm-based products. Our annual use of palm kernel oil and its derivatives requires an average of 785,000 hectares of cultivated acreage. As one of the largest global processors of palm kernel oil, we will continue our commitment to continu ously improving sustainability along the entire value chain.

Strategy

 Tailor-made products and solutions improve our customers' applications and processes
 Global presence ensures reliable supply to customers in all regions
 Pigments activities transferred to independent legal entities; new Electronic Materials business unit
We take on the challenges posed by important future issues, especially population growth: scarce resources, environmental and climatic stressors, greater demand for food and the desire for better quality of life. In doing so, we focus on research and development and maintain close relationships to leading companies in our key customer industries. We position ourselves globally in order to reliably supply customers in all regions. We invest in the development of innovations that enable our products and processes ­ as well as our customers' applications and processes ­ to make a contribution to sustainability: for example, by allowing resources to be used more efficiently.
Industry-specific specialties make up a major part of our product range. These products create additional value for our customers, which allows them to stand out from the competition. We develop new solutions together with our customers and strive for long-term partnerships which create profitable growth opportunities for both sides.

We pursue a different business model for standard products, such as vitamins or dispersions for paper coatings. Here, efficient production setups, backward integration in our Production Verbund's value chains, capacity management, and technology and cost leadership are all essential.
We support our customers by serving as a reliable supplier with consistently high product quality, good value for money and lean processes.
In July 2016, we transferred the global pigments activities to independent legal entities. The largest is BASF Colors & Effects GmbH, headquartered in Ludwigshafen, Germany. This reorganization allows for better adaptation to the challenges facing the pigment industry.
As of January 1, 2017, all resources of the BASF Group for the electronics industry, including the activities of the Monomers division for the semiconductor and display sectors, were combined into a new global business unit, Electronic Materials, allocated to the Dispersions & Pigments division. This will strengthen our position as a strategic partner to the major electronics manufacturers.
We began planning construction of a new vitamin A complex in Ludwigshafen, scheduled to start up in 2020.

Performance Products segment
 At 15,002 million, sales driven down 4% mainly by prices and divestitures
 EBIT before special items improves by 28% to 1,745 million, primarily due to lower fixed costs and higher margins
At 15,002 million, sales to third parties in 2016 in the Performance Products segment were 646 million below the level of the previous year. This was primarily attributable to falling sales prices and the divestitures completed in 2015 (volumes 1%, prices ­2%, portfolio ­2%, currencies ­1%). The drop in sales prices was largely the result of oil-price-related reductions in raw material costs, in addition to ongoing pressure on prices in the hygiene business. Sharp increases in vitamin prices in the Nutrition & Health division helped counter this d evelopment.

In addition, the portfolio measures taken in 2015 -- in particular, the divestiture of parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients and services business and the paper hydrous kaolin activities, as well as the sale of the textile chemicals business -- led to diminished sales in 2016. Currency effects slightly dampened sales in all divisions. We achieved volumes growth overall in the remaining business.
We raised income from operations (EBIT) before special items by 379 million to 1,745 million. This was mostly due to significantly reduced fixed costs thanks to restructuring measures and strict fixed cost management, in addition to improved margins. At 1,648 million, EBIT exceeded the previous year's level by 308 million. Special charges were predominantly attributable to restructuring measures. Special income arose particularly from the sale of the photoinitiator business.

 EBIT before special items improves considerably thanks to reduced fixed costs

At 4,530 million, sales to third parties were 99 million below the level of the previous year in the Dispersions & Pigments division. Lower sales prices weighed down by an oil-price- related drop in raw material costs were the main reason behind this slight decline. We were able to slightly raise overall sales volumes.
Demand in the dispersions business developed positively, especially in Asia and Europe, but sales as a whole fell on account of price declines. Sales of resins decreased mainly as a result of lower prices. The closure of the production plant in Kankakee, Illinois, also weighed down sales; growth impetus, on the other hand, came from Europe and Asia. In the additives business, rising volumes drove an increase in sales. In July 2016, we transferred our global pigments activities to independent legal entities. Sales in this sector increased slightly thanks largely to the positive business development in Asia; by contrast, sales fell in Europe.

We considerably improved EBIT before special items in 2016, predominantly thanks to higher margins. We held fix costs at the previous year's level through strict cost discipline. Special charges were below the level of the previous year, and were mostly related to restructuring measures. They were partly offset by gains from the disposal of the photoinitiator business.

In the Care Chemicals division, sales to third parties fell by 165 million to 4,735 million in 2016. This was p redominantly the result of reduced prices due to lower raw material prices and ongoing intense competition in the hygiene business. Negative currency effects, especially from the Argentinian peso and Brazilian real, additionally dampened sales.
Sales volumes matched the prior-year level in a market environment that remained difficult. We increased sales volumes, especially in our business with ingredients for the detergents and cleaners industry, as well as in the Asia Pacific region. This compensated for lower demand, especially in the hygiene business and in South America.

We were able to reduce fixed costs through strict cost discipline, thereby more than offsetting the continued pressure on margins that came largely from the hygiene business. As a consequence, EBIT before special items rose slightly compared with the previous year. Special charges were predominantly attributable to restructuring measures.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we started up the expanded production facility for chelating agents, including Trilon® M, at the site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. We increased production volumes of surfactants in Dahej, India, in 2016. We continued modification work for the new superabsorbent technology at the site in Antwerp, Belgium, and plan to complete this in 2017.

 Sales down by 3% to 1,932 million after divestitures in pharmac euticals business
 Considerable improvement in EBIT before special items, especially through lower fixed costs and higher margins and volumes
Sales to third parties in 2016 declined by 66 million to 1,932 million in the Nutrition & Health division. This slight reduction came from the sale of parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients and services business at the end of September 2015. We were able to raise volumes in all business areas. Demand grew, especially in the pharmaceuticals and animal nutrition businesses. Sales prices overall were also higher than in the previous year, primarily as a result of significant price increases for vitamins in the animal nutrition business. This a llowed us to more than compensate for the decline in prices in the flavor and fragrance business brought about by falling raw material costs.

 Sales down 8% to 3,805 million, mainly due to lower prices and divestitures
 EBIT before special items rise slightly, mostly through reduction in fixed costs
In the Performance Chemicals division, sales to third parties fell by 316 million to 3,805 million compared with 2015. This was largely the result of the lower sales prices brought about by a sharp drop in raw material prices, as well as the sale of the paper hydrous kaolin activities and the textile chemicals business. Negative currency effects additionally weighed down sales. We were able to raise our volumes overall, with growth impetus coming particularly from the plastic additives business and from the region Europe. Demand for oilfield and mining chemicals declined, however, in an environment fraught with lower oil and raw material prices.

EBIT before special items improved considerably compared with 2015 due to substantially reduced fixed costs as well as to higher margins and volumes. The reduction in fixed costs was largely thanks to restructuring measures and improved capacity utilization of our production plants. Special charges were primarily related to measures implemented to increase our competitiveness. Special income arose in part from the sale of the sterol site in Pasadena, Texas, in May 2016.
We concluded the modification of our production plant for polyvinylpyrrolidone in Shanghai, China, in 2016. With our partner, PETRONAS, we completed construction of the new aroma ingredients complex at the integrated chemic al site in Kuantan, Malaysia. Production facilities for c itral and L -menthol will be gradually started up.

We achieved a slight rise in EBIT before special items compared with the previous year. This was mainly due to lower fixed costs resulting from restructuring measures and strict cost discipline. Special charges arose partly on account of these restructuring measures.
At the Bradford, England, site, in 2016 we started up a world-scale bio-acrylamide production plant employing a new enzymatic catalysis process. This will strengthen our polymer production network and increase our competitiveness.

Repairing paint damage requires a series of time-consuming steps: For example, primer and filler need to be applied separately, and each needs time for drying and cooling. Our product eliminates one step for steel surfaces, as it serves as both primer and filler. It can also be cured with UVA light, which, unlike conventional methods, generates no heat and thus requires no cooling time. After the successful launch in 2016, we expect annual sales of this UV primer filler to grow by more than 19% on average from 2017 to 2021.

The new UV primer filler allows our customers to save up to 65% of their time in repairing paint damage, depending on the surface material and paint shop equipment. Especially smaller and medium-sized repairs can be conducted more economically. The use of UVA light is also considerably more energy- efficient than other curing methods and prevents plastic parts, like bumpers, from warping. We market the UV primer filler under our brand names Glasurit® and R-M®.

Functional Materials & Solutions segment

Catalysts

 Sales grow by 1% to 18,732 million  EBIT before special items increases by 18% to 
1,946 million as a result of higher contributions from all divisions
In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, sales to third parties increased by 209 million to 18,732 million. By increasing volumes in all divisions, we were able to more than compensate for lower prices and mildly negative currency effects (volumes 7%, prices ­5%, portfolio 0%, currencies ­1%). The volumes growth was mainly attributable to higher demand for our products for the automotive industry. Business with the construction industry saw sales volumes at a high level overall.
Income from operations (EBIT) before special items grew by 297 million to 1,946 million compared with 2015. All divisions contributed to this considerable earnings increase, with particular support from higher margins in the Performance Materials division. Special income in 2016 especially pertained to the sale of the industrial coatings business as well as the divestiture of the business with polyolefin catalysts. EBIT rose by 592 million to 2,199 million.
For the Outlook for 2017, see page 122

 Sales decline by 1% to 6,263 million, mainly due to lower prices
 EBIT before special items improves considerably, mostly through contribution from mobile emissions catalysts
In the Catalysts division, sales to third parties declined in 2016 by 43 million to 6,263 million. This was predominantly the result of price decreases due to lower precious metal prices. Currency effects and the sale of our business with polyolefin catalysts had a negative impact on sales.
We achieved significant volumes growth, especially through increased volumes of mobile emissions catalysts. Greater demand for refinery catalysts and battery materials also contributed to this development. Lower volumes of chemical catalysts slowed this growth. In precious metal trading, sales declined by 52 million to 2,336 million due to lower prices.

We considerably raised EBIT before special items year-onyear, mainly thanks to the higher contributions from the mobile emissions catalysts business. In addition, we were able to reduce fixed costs through strict cost discipline. Special charges resulted primarily from asset impairments and special income from the sale of the polyolefin catalysts business in June 2016.

Construction Chemicals

 Sales rise by 1% to 2,332 million as a result of increased sales volumes
 Slight growth in EBIT before special items, thanks primarily to higher sales volumes

In the Construction Chemicals division, sales to third parties reached 2,332 million, an increase of 28 million over 2015. Negative currency effects in all regions and lower prices overall were more than offset by higher sales volumes.
In Europe and North America, sales grew as a result of this volumes increase; prices remained stable. In the region South America, Africa, Middle East, lower volumes and negative c urrency effects were the main factors behind a drop in sales. D emand declined in Saudi Arabia especially, as the number of public construction projects fell due to low oil prices. Falling prices were largely responsible for reduced sales in Asia. We were able to increase volumes in the region.

Income from operations before special items was slightly higher than the level of 2015, primarily as a result of volumes growth.
Coatings
 Sales increase by 3% to 3,249 million  EBIT before special items considerably up,
especially in automotive OEM coatings
In the Coatings division, sales to third parties in 2016 grew by 83 million to 3,249 million. Higher sales volumes in North America and Asia were able to more than compensate for a volumes decline in South America. Prices remained stable overall; negative currency effects in all businesses had a dampening effect on sales.
Sales of automotive OEM coatings grew slightly thanks to higher volumes in North America and Asia. In the automotive refinish coatings business, we observed a slight sales decline as higher prices could only partly offset negative currency effects and slightly lower volumes. The slight sales growth in the industrial coatings business was attributable to higher volumes. Sales fell slightly in the decorative paints b usiness in Brazil, despite significantly increased sales prices. This was mostly the result of overall weak demand as well as negative currency effects.

We were able to raise EBIT before special items considerably in 2016, especially through the contribution from automotive OEM coatings. Special income came from the sale of the industrial coatings business in December 2016.
Since December 14, 2016, the Coatings division has included the Chemetall business, which was acquired from Albemarle. This has had no significant influence on the result for the reporting year 2016.

Performance Materials
 Sales grow by 2% to 6,888 million through higher volumes
 EBIT before special items rises considerably due  to stronger margins and specialties business
The Performance Materials division raised its sales to third parties by 141 million to 6,888 million in 2016. This was largely thanks to sharp volumes growth, primarily in Asia and Europe. Prices fell as a result of lower raw material prices. Negative currency effects and portfolio measures additionally dampened sales.
Our businesses with the automotive industry developed positively thanks to significantly higher demand in Asia. We were especially able to achieve substantial volumes growth for polyurethane systems, engineering plastics and the special elastomer Cellasto®.
In the consumer goods industry, sales were slightly down, primarily on account of lower prices while volumes remained stable. We particularly achieved higher volumes of engineering plastics, thermoplastic polyurethanes and biopolymers, while demand ebbed slightly for polyurethane systems.
Sales to the construction sector also declined as a result of falling prices and the divestiture of our white expandable polystyrene (EPS) business in North and South America in March 2015. Volumes development was positive for polyurethane systems and functional foams.

EBIT before special items considerably exceeded that of the previous year. Contributing significantly to this were higher margins due to lower raw material prices and the positive developm ent of our high-margin specialties business. Despite higher production costs from new plant startups, including the capacity expansion for Cellasto® in Shanghai, China, we were able to reduce fixed costs compared with 2015.

Inscalis® Innovative insecticide solution for use with numerous plants

Value for BASF

Value for our customers and the environment

Peak sales
potential >100 million

Advantages compared with conventional insecticides

3-fold

Inscalis® is an innovative solution of a new chemical class for combating piercing and sucking pests. Inscalis® will play an important role in BASF's insecticide portfolio, and be used for various plants in numerous countries starting at the end of the decade. We expect peak sales potential of more than 100 million.

Inscalis® offers a three-fold advantage compared with conventional insecticides. Effective in low doses, it is also characterized by low toxicity for beneficial insects such as bees and an alternative mode of action for combating the most important pests. For farmers, this means greater flexibility in application and higher yields with better quality.

Strategy

 Helping to feed a growing world population  Long-term innovation strategy ensures future growth  Development of solutions that go beyond
conventional crop protection
Our strategy is based on long-term market trends. A key challenge of the future will be to ensure sufficient food for a growing world population. This means that farmers around the world need to increase their yields ­ and yet the natural resources for doing so, such as water and arable land, are limited. We see it as our duty to provide farmers with professional support in producing more ­ and more nutritious ­ food as efficiently as possible.
We are committed to the responsible treatment of our products and the environment. We offer our customers a broad portfolio of integrated solutions and constantly invest in our development pipeline to create chemical and biological innovations in crop protection.
Our research and development activities range from solutions for guarding plants against fungi, insects and weeds, to seeds and soil management, to plant health. For example, the Functional Crop Care business unit not only provides products

for improving seeds and innovations for better soil management, but also biological and chemical technologies that make plants better able to withstand stress factors like heat, cold and nutrient deficiency.
We are intensifying our investment in growth markets and continuing to expand our good position in our core markets. In collaboration with seed companies, we benefit from the technological competence of our crop protection research. In addition, we work together with external partners to be able to offer the best solutions for our customers. With our own projects, jointly with partners like John Deere and in collaboration with farmers, we drive the development of integrated IT applications for modern, sustainable agriculture. One example is the Maglis® digital platform developed by BASF. Since its launch at the beginning of 2016, the BASF team has used Maglis® to support farmers in collecting, interpreting and monitoring a range of agricultural data. This enables them to optimize management and make better decisions in cultivating and marketing crops.

Investments

Plant biotechnology at BASF

In 2016, we invested 205 million in property, plant and equipment. Most of this investment amount is attributable to the expansion of dicamba production capacity in Beaumont, Texas. We also increased capacities for the fungicide Xemium® and enlarged a formulation plant for fungicides in Tarragona, Spain. Furthermore, we are continuing to invest in innovative solutions that go beyond classic crop protection. One example from the area of Functional Crop Care is our new research and development center for biological crop protection and seed solutions in Limburgerhof, Germany, which combines expertise in chemical and biological solutions. In order to continue meeting the ongoing high demand for our innovative products in the future, we will invest around 840 million in developing and expanding our infrastructure and in our production and formulation capacities for active ingredients between 2017 and 2021.

BASF's activities in the field of plant biotechnology are part of the Bioscience Research technology platform. Research and development expenses, sales, earnings and all other data are not included in the Agricultural Solutions segment; they are reported in Other.
With our network of research sites, we help farmers meet the growing demand for increased agricultural productivity as well as better nutrition. As part of the regular review of our portfolio, we focused our research activities in 2016 on projects with the highest business and technological potential. These projects included the development of crops characterized by higher yields and stress resistance, herbicide tolerance, or resistance against certain diseases. Part of this realignment involved adapting our site structure in North America and Europe; around 350 of approximately 750 positions were cut. Our product marketing takes place in part together with leading seed providers.

Agricultural S olutions segment
 Lower volumes and currency effects lead to 4% decline in sales to 5,569 million
 At 1,087 million, EBIT before special items matches prior-year level
In the Agricultural Solutions segment, sales to third parties in 2016 fell by 251 million to 5,569 million as a result of lower sales volumes and negative currency effects. The challenging market environment for crop protection products particularly dampened demand for insecticides in South America and for fungicides in Europe. Prices matched the level of 2015 (volumes -2%, prices 0%, currencies -2%).
In Europe, sales declined by 149 million to 1,958 million. This was mainly attributable to weaker demand for fungicides in the first half of the year. Especially in Germany and Poland, volumes fell as a result of unfavorable weather conditions and our customers' high inventory levels. Price increases, primarily in central and eastern Europe, including Russia, were unable to offset the lower volumes and negative currency effects.
Sales in North America decreased by 69 million to 1,801 million, predominantly because of lower prices, especially for fungicides in the United States. Higher demand for fungicides and insecticides in the United States and for herbicides in Canada helped support volumes development.

At 549 million, sales in Asia exceeded the previous year's level by 24 million. We were able to raise sales volumes in all indications, largely driven by substantially higher demand for herbicides in India and the overall positive volumes development in Indonesia and Australia. Currency effects slightly dampened sales.
In South America, sales fell by 57 million to 1,261 million, basically due to lower insecticide volumes in Brazil. This was primarily attributable to our customers' high inventory levels and critical economic situation, as well as the shrinking market for insecticides in the region. Price increases were u nable to fully compensate for the drop in volumes.
Strict cost management enabled us to reduce fixed costs in the Agricultural Solutions segment. Thanks to this development, income from operations (EBIT) before special items matched the previous year's level at 1,087 million despite the sales decline. Due to special charges from the optimization of our production structure, EBIT decreased by 46 million to 1,037 million.

An innovative construction concept enabled us to save around 25% in investment costs while reconstructing our tank farm in Barnstorf, Germany. Typical construction methods would have meant replacing the previous twelve crude oil and water tanks with five new ones, and building individual facilities for separating the oil from associated substances and storing it. Because our new tanks allow both at the same time, four new tanks were sufficient. These can be employed more flexibly and economically and ensure lower maintenance costs.

The new, optimized tanks are especially safe and do not require large concrete containment systems underneath. Instead, the oil tanks feature an accessible annular gap, while the water tanks are constructed with vacuum-monitored d ouble walls. This increases their energy efficiency: Thanks to the thermally insulating air layer in the annular gap and the especially well insulated double floor, the amount of energy needed to heat the oil tanks has been reduced by around 95% over the course of a year.

Strategy

 Growth through exploration, acquisitions, strategic partnerships and technological expertise
 Contribution to securing Europe's natural gas supply
In the future, crude oil and natural gas will continue to contribute significantly toward covering the rising energy demand of a growing world population. That is why we invest in the exploration and production of oil and gas, primarily in our core regions Europe, North Africa, Russia and South America. We want to establish the Middle East as another core region in our portfolio.
Selected collaborations and strategic partnerships, innovative technologies and the responsible development and production of hydrocarbons all form the basis of our growth-oriented strategy. Through the continuous optimization of our cost structure and portfolio of oil and gas activities, we ensure our future competitive viability, even in times when oil and gas prices are low. Measured by production volumes, gas activities comprised around 70% of our portfolio.

Handling hydrocarbons in a responsible manner demands special measures for the protection of people and the environment. We therefore carefully assess the potential effects of every project before we begin. Together with experts, contractors and relevant stakeholders, we develop methods and carry out measures for using resources even more efficiently and minimizing impact on the environment. This includes acting in accordance with international agreements, legal requirements and our own, self-imposed high standards.
Wintershall's natural gas trading and storage activities were transferred to Gazprom with the swap of assets of equal value completed in September 2015, and are no longer part of our portfolio. Our cooperation with Gazprom in the natural gas transport business continues unaltered. With western Europe's long-term demand for natural gas steadily on the rise, while its local production simultaneously decreases, securing sufficient imports is gaining in importance.

BASF Report 2016

Exploration & Production
 Active portfolio management, including expansion of our position in Norway
Europe: The Mittelplate field off the North Sea coast is the cornerstone of our crude oil production in Germany. We own a 50% share in the next development phase of this largest known oil deposit in the country. We are expanding production in Emlichheim by drilling twelve new wells, two of which s tarted producing between September and December 2016. Winters hall is assessing a redevelopment of the Suderbruch oilfield with two exploration wells. We continued the field test for increasing recovery rates using the biopolymer Schizophyllan at the Bockstedt oilfield.
In Norway, we were able to expand annual production to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. The further development of fields in which we hold a stake included the installation of two subsea tiebacks in the Norwegian Sea for the Wintershall-operated Maria field in the summer of 2016. These were connected at a depth of 300 meters to the nearby platforms Kristin, Heidrun and Åsgard B, enabling us to use the existing infrastructure for production in the Maria field, in which Wintershall holds a 50% share. Wintershall also has shares in the Ivar Aasen offshore platform installed and started up in 2016. In January 2016, Wintershall obtained shares in seven new exploration licenses on the Norwegian continental shelf from the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Wintershall will take over operatorship of four licenses.
As part of ongoing portfolio optimization, Wintershall Norge AS agreed with Statoil Petroleum AS (both based in Stavanger, Norway) on the sale of its 25% share in the Byrding field on the Norwegian continental shelf. The field, also known by its previous name, Astero, was discovered in 2005 and is located in the Troll/Fram region of the North Sea. Wintershall Norge furthermore divested its 10% share in the Yme license ­ also on the Norwegian continental shelf ­ to OKEA AS, an oil company based in Trondheim, Norway.
In Denmark, we are continuing the transition from the d evelopment to the production phase of the Ravn field. The crude oil is to be transported through a subsea pipeline from an unmanned production platform to the A6-A platform 18 kilometers away in the German North Sea. Ravn will be the first field in Denmark that Wintershall Noordzee B.V. (Rijswijk, Norway) transfers to the production phase as operator. The Danish energy ministry granted Wintershall three new licenses in the Danish North Sea at the beginning of 2016. Wintershall is the operator in all three licenses.

Russia: The Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field in western S iberia, in which we have a 35% economic interest, has been operating at plateau production since 2009. We hold a 50% stake in the development of Block IA of the Achimov formation in the Urengoy field in western Siberia. The gradual development of this field was continued and 78 wells were producing at the end of 2016. We will develop blocks IV and V of the Achimov formation together with Gazprom.
North Africa / Middle East: In Libya, we are the operator of eight oilfields in the onshore concessions 96 and 97. Due to difficult political conditions, we were only able to start producing in concession 96 again on September 16, 2016, at a low level of 35,000 BOE a day. No production took place in concession 97 in 2016. At the Al Jurf oilfield off the coast of Libya, in which we have a stake, operations could be continued without interruption.
In Abu Dhabi, we began drilling our second appraisal well as operator in the development of the Shuwaihat sour gas field in November 2016. It is Wintershall's first offshore exploration well in the Shuwaihat field.
Wintershall signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2016 with the National Iranian Oil Company on a potential collaboration.
South America: We hold shares in a total of fifteen onshore and offshore fields in Argentina. In February 2016, the offshore field Vega Pléyade, operated by Total Austral S.A., began production off the coast of Tierra del Fuego. We drilled additional wells as an operator in the Vaca Muerta shale formation in the Neuquén province, as stipulated in the joint operation agreement between Wintershall Energía S.A. (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and Gas y Petróleo del Neuquén S.A. (Neuquén, Argentina).

Natural Gas Transport
 Mostly regulated business with stable conditions  Joint activities with Gazprom
The highly regulated natural gas transport sector is characterized by stable conditions and yields based on approved costs and tariffs. Our organizational structure allows us to meet the unbundling requirements set down by the German Energy Act: As a holding company for the German subsidiaries in natural gas transport, WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG (WIGA) mainly fulfills a reporting and financing capacity. G ASCADE Gastransport GmbH, OPAL Gastransport GmbH & Co. KG, and NEL Gastransport GmbH all act as independent companies under the umbrella of the holding company.
The companies under the WIGA umbrella operate a 3,300-kilometer long-distance network that includes the pipeline links to the Nord Stream Pipeline, the Baltic Sea Pipeline Link (OPAL) and the North European Gas Pipeline (NEL).

We hold a 15.5% share in the Nord Stream Pipeline through Nord Stream AG, based in Zug, Switzerland, which is accounted for in the BASF Group's financial statements using the equity method. Other shareholders are Gazprom (51%) and E.ON (15.5%), as well as N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie and ENGIE (9% each). With a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, this pipeline, which stretches from Russia to the German coast over the Baltic Sea, helps shore up supply security in Europe.
The contracts signed in 2015 to join the companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 AG were canceled in September 2016 after withdrawal of the antitrust clearance application in Poland. BASF continues to firmly believe in the significance of this project for Europe, and is evaluating possibilities to support the endeavor. The project is being developed by Nord Stream 2 AG, a project company in which Gazprom holds 100% of the shares.

Oil & Gas segment
 Sales decline by 79% and EBIT before special items down by 62% due to discontinuation of contributions from gas trading and storage business as well as to lower oil and gas prices
In the Oil & Gas segment, sales to third parties decreased by 10,230 million to 2,768 million year-on-year (volumes 3%, prices/currencies ­3%, portfolio ­79%). Owing to the asset swap with Gazprom completed at the end of September 2015, contributions from the natural gas trading and storage business and from Wintershall Noordzee B.V. ceased as of the fourth quarter of 2015. These activities had contributed 10.1 billion to sales in 2015. In the continuing oil and gas business, we raised volumes by 15% compared with 2015, while price and currency effects came out to minus 15%. The price of a barrel of Brent blend crude oil averaged $44 in 2016 (2015: $52). Gas prices on European spot markets dropped 29%, also a sharp fall compared with the previous year. Both oil and gas prices recovered significantly toward the end of 2016 as compared with the beginning of the year.

Income from operations (EBIT) before special items declined by 849 million to 517 million in 2016. This was primarily the result of falling oil and gas prices, in addition to the divestiture of our gas trading and storage business to Gazprom. The activities transferred to Gazprom had contributed around 260 million to EBIT before special items in 2015. In addition, as we had expected, the earnings contribution from our share in the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field was lower: A contractual agreement with our partner Gazprom stipulated that the excess amounts received over previous years be compensated in 2016. Positive effects came from comprehensive measures aimed at optimizing exploration and technology projects as well as the successful implementation of operational cost-saving measures. EBIT declined by 573 million to 499 million. Net income declined by 688 million to 362 million.
For the Outlook for 2017, see page 123
We increased our crude oil and natural gas production by 12 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 165 million BOE. In the search for new crude oil and natural gas deposits, we finished drilling a total of 14 exploration and appraisal wells in 2016, of which 9 were successful. Our proven crude oil and natural gas reserves fell by 7% compared with the end of 2015, to 1,622 million BOE. We replenished 26% of the volumes produced in 2016. The reserve-to-production ratio is around 10 years (2015: 11 years). This is based on Winters hall's production in 2016 and refers to the reserves at yearend.

Sales in Other fell by 772 million to 2,018 million compared with 2015. Lower prices and volumes in the raw materials trading business were primarily responsible, along with the expiration of supply contracts in connection with the disposal of our share in the Ellba Eastern Private Ltd. joint operation in Singapore at the end of 2014.

Income from operations before special items in Other declined by 162 million to minus 1,050 million. This was largely attributable to valuation effects for our long-term incentive program. Positive currency effects helped slow the decline.

 At 27,221 million, sales down by 30% compared with previous year
 Additional investments initiated at Ludwigshafen Verbund site

 Sales down 6% from the previous year to 14,682 million
 Ongoing investments in production plants, such as for ammonia and herbicides

In 2016, sales at companies headquartered in the region Europe amounted to 27,221 million, 30% below the previous year's level. This was mainly attributable to the considerable decline in sales in the Oil & Gas segment following the disposal of our gas trading and storage business to Gazprom in September 2015.
Despite strong volumes growth, the Chemicals segment posted a considerable drop in sales due to lower sales prices brought about by decreased raw material prices. Sales in the Performance Products segment declined slightly, largely on account of lower prices and the disposal of portions of our pharmaceutical ingredients and services business. In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, significantly higher volumes were able to more than compensate for price declines, resulting in a sales increase. Despite increased sales prices, a combination of lower volumes and negative currency effects resulted in a considerable drop in sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment. Sales declined considerably in Other.
Income from operations (EBIT) fell by 13% year-on-year to 3,632 million, primarily owing to the decrease in the Oil & Gas segment. Contributions were also smaller from the Chemicals and Agricultural Solutions segments, as well as from Other. The Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments, however, raised their EBIT.
We are strengthening our market position through further investments at the Ludwigshafen Verbund site, such as the replacement of our acetylene plant with a state-of-the-art, highly efficient production facility, and the expansion of capacities for resins.

Sales at companies headquartered in North America were down by 6% compared with 2015 in both euro and local currency terms, amounting to 14,682 million. This was largely due to decreased sales prices brought about by lower raw material prices, especially in the Chemicals segment. Sales volumes remained stable overall. Rising volumes in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment were able to offset the lower volumes in the Chemicals and Performance Products segments.
EBIT fell 14% to 1,113 million compared with the previous year. Significantly increased contributions from the Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments were only partially able to compensate for the sales and margin-related earnings decline in the Chemicals segment.
In this region, we continue to focus on innovation, attractive market segments and cross-business initiatives in order to grow profitably. At the same time, we ares increasing our operational excellence through continuous improvement. Investments in new production facilities form the basis for future growth. For example, we are building a new ammonia plant in Freeport, Texas, with Yara; expanding production capacities for our dicamba and dimethenamid-P herbicides in Beaumont, Texas; and modifying the plant in Pasadena, Texas, to produce our Palatinol® DOTP plasticizer so we can meet growing demand in North America. Beyond that, we aim to gradually expand the production capacity of MDI at our G eismar, Louisiana, Verbund site.

At 11,512 million, sales at companies headquartered in the Asia Pacific region fell by 2% in 2016; in local currency terms, sales matched the level of the previous year.
Low oil and raw material prices weighed on sales, especially at the beginning of the year. While sales prices did substantially recover over the year, they still showed an overall decline for 2016. Sales were also dampened by negative currency effects and portfolio measures such as the sale of the textile chemicals business in June 2015, parts of our pharmaceutical ingredients and services business in September 2015, and the polyolefin catalysts business in July 2016. Sales in Other decreased considerably. Volumes growth of around 5% in this region was only partially able to offset these effects. We raised sales volumes in all segments.
EBIT in the region grew by 147% to 1,098 million. This was mainly due to higher volumes and margins in all segments. Through strict cost management, fixed costs rose only slightly compared with the previous year, despite the startup of several new plants.
As part of our regional strategy, we want to further increase the proportion of sales from local production in Asia Pacific in the years ahead. We once again made progress toward this goal: In Korla, China, we started up a polytetrahydrofuran (PolyTHF®) plant with our partner Markor, and in Shanghai, China, we completed the modification of the polyvinyl pyrrolidone plant. In Kuantan, Malaysia, we and our partner PETRONAS started up a production plant for 2-ethylhexanoic acid and finished construction of the new aroma chemicals complex. Further endeavors, such as catalyst production plants in Caojing, China, and Rayong, Thailand, are currently under construction and progressing on schedule.

At 4,135 million, sales for companies headquartered in South America, Africa, Middle East fell 6% below the level of 2015. In local currency terms, sales were up by 2%.
Gross domestic product shrank in South America primarily as a consequence of the continuing recession in Brazil as well as the economic environment and structural reforms in Argentina. Our sales declined slightly under these conditions. Price increases enabled us to partly offset negative currency e ffects, especially from the depreciation of the Argentinian peso, and weaker sales volumes. Sales declined in the chemicals1 and crop protection businesses but rose in the Oil & Gas segment.
Companies in Africa and in the Middle East posted a considerable sales decrease owing to currency effects and downward pressure on prices. The drop in sales in South Africa was primarily due to the depreciation of the rand; this particularly affected the Functional Materials & Solutions segment. In the Middle East, a slump in selling prices affected by falling raw material prices negatively impacted our business in the Performance Products and Functional Materials & Solutions segments.
EBIT grew by 29% to 432 million, supported especially by the higher contribution from the chemicals business.
In South America in 2016, we continued implementing a series of structural measures that increase our productivity and sharpen the focus on our customers' needs. We have expanded our production in Guaratinguetá, Brazil, with the startup of a 2-ethylhexyl acrylate plant that will allow us to tap into the region's growing demand.

Strategy

With our sustainability-oriented supply chain management, we contribute to risk management by clarifying our expectations and standards for our suppliers, and by supporting them in carrying out our specifications. We count on reliable supply relationships and want to make our suppliers' contribution to sustainable development transparent. In order to achieve this, we set ourselves an ambitious goal: By 2020, we aim to evaluate the sustainability performance of 70% of the BASF Group's relevant suppliers1 pursuant to our risk-based approach and develop action plans for any necessary improvements. The proportion of evaluated relevant suppliers was at 32% by the end of 2016. Furthermore, our P rocurement competence center supports BASF's business units in developing solutions to stand out from the competition in addressing customers' market-specific requirements.

2020 Goal
Percentage of relevant suppliers evaluated for their sustainability performance

70%

Both new and existing suppliers are selected and evaluated not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also on environmental, social and corporate governance standards. Our Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations' Global Compact, the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions and the topic areas of the Responsible Care Initiative. The Code of Conduct covers compliance with human rights, labor and social standards, and antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies in addition to protecting the environment. The Code is available in 26 languages.
A country-based risk analysis forms the basis of our selection process for new suppliers. As a result of the country- related risks identified in South America and Asia, we queried around 2,100 suppliers in 2016 on their commitment to the values of our Supplier Code of Conduct. We moreover pro vided training to a total of 267 suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk, especially in Asia and South America, in 2016.
In addition, we instructed 292 procurement employees on sustainability-oriented supplier management. These are ways in which potential supply chain risks can be identified and minimized together with our suppliers.

Worldwide procurement

Evaluating our suppliers

From our suppliers, we obtain raw materials, technical goods, and services ­ from technical to logistics and building facility services. BASF acquired raw materials, goods and services for our own production totaling approximately 34 billion in value from more than 70,000 suppliers around the world in 2016. Around 90% of this was locally sourced. With regard to our suppliers, there were no substantial changes in our value chain in 2016.

 "Together for Sustainability" initiative aims to harmonize and standardize supplier assessments and audits
 104 raw material supplier sites audited
BASF is a founding member of the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative of leading chemical companies for the global standardization of supplier evaluations and auditing. With the help of TfS, we promote sustainability in the supply chain. The initiative aims to develop and implement a global program for the responsible supply of goods and services and improve suppliers' environmental and social standards. The evaluation process is simplified for both suppliers and TfS member companies by a globally uniform questionnaire. The initiative's members conducted a total of 1,773 sustainability assessments and 241 audits in 2016. Membership has tripled since the initiative was founded; there were 19 members in 2016.

1 We define relevant suppliers as those showing an elevated sustainability risk potential as identified by risk matrices and with respect to corresponding country risks. Our suppliers are evaluated based on risk due to the size and scale of our supplier portfolio.

BASF Report 2016 

Management's Report 93
Responsibility along the value chain -- Suppliers

We conducted a Supplier Day in Mumbai, India, in 2016 as part of the TfS initiative. TfS also provided training to suppliers at the annual China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF) Conference in Shanghai, China, in order to strengthen awareness for sustainability in the region.
Using TfS evaluations, we pursue a risk-oriented approach with clearly defined, BASF-specific follow-up processes. We drive these processes through a sustainability-oriented IT tool. Suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk are identified u sing risk matrices. Furthermore, our purchasers indicate the suppliers for whom they see a potentially elevated sustainability risk. We additionally check various information sources to see if any suppliers have been observed in connection with negative sustainability incidents. Based on these analyses, we audited a total of 104 raw material supplier sites on sustainability standards and had 551 sustainability assessments conducted by an external service provider in 2016.
If we identify potential for improvement, we support suppliers in developing measures to fulfill our standards. We conduct another review according to a defined timeframe based on the sustainability risk measured. If the weak points discovered were particularly severe and we are unable to confirm any improvement, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship. This occurred in two cases in 2016. We use this approach to evaluate suppliers with an elevated sustainability risk at least every five years. The approach itself is reviewed every two years to identify possibilities for optimization.

Supplier training
In 2016, we continued our collaborations in China and Brazil to instruct suppliers on sustainability standards. We have developed a training program for China together with the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai. In Brazil, we are pursuing the same approach together with the Espaço Eco® Foundation. Through these cooperations, 267 suppliers received training in 2016.

Audit results
Our audits have revealed some deviations with respect to working hours and payment of the minimum wage, especially in China. Here, we have called for improvements on the part of our suppliers. None of our 2016 audits identified instances of child labor. For the suppliers we reviewed, persons under 18 were excluded from overtime and dangerous work; we found one case of unauthorized night work. We did not find any incidences of forced labor in 2016.
In August 2012, during an extended mining strike involving workers of the London-based platinum supplier Lonmin Plc in Marikana, South Africa, the conflict escalated and culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police. Lonmin mine workers were among the fatalities. In June 2015, the Farlam Report commissioned by the South African government was released on the incidents.1
BASF undertook a thorough examination of the issues raised. We intensified our regular exchange with both Lonmin and with local stakeholders, such as leading industry and h uman rights representatives. Discussions included Lonmin's measures for improving the living conditions of its workers.
At the end of 2015, BASF had an Environment, Social, Governance audit conducted at Lonmin by an internationally recognized audit firm, in accordance with enhanced TfS requirements. In the process, deficits were detected in areas such as the grievance process for workers and residents, as well as safety and security. Based on the results, BASF e nhanced the questionnaire and expanded it with a view to industry-specific challenges in the mining sector. A follow-up audit conducted in January 2017 is currently being evaluated. We will use our sphere of influence within the platinum value chain to create awareness for industry-specific challenges and develop approaches for solutions together.

Responsible resource management is an integral part of our strategy. It is applied within the company through our Verbund concept, our innovative products and the use of renewable raw materials. In the search for alternative raw materials, we employ solutions that contribute to sustainability.
Strategy
The Verbund system is an important component of our resource efficiency strategy: The by-products of one plant o ften serve as feedstock elsewhere, thus helping us to use raw materials more efficiently. In 2016, BASF purchased a total of around 30,000 different raw materials from more than 6,000 suppliers. Some of our most important raw materials are naphtha, natural gas, methanol, ammonia and benzene. In addition to fossil resources, we also employ renewable raw materials. We use these to manufacture products that either cannot be made with fossil resources, or only at significantly greater expense. Renewable raw materials also give us the opportunity to expand our raw material basis. Depending on the application, the better solution can be fossil or renewable raw materials; renewable raw materials are not per se sustainable, but can contribute to sustainability by, for example, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Renewable resources
 Joint venture with Avantium  Numerous projects to improve sustainability along
the value chain
In 2016, around 5.4% of the raw materials we purchased worldwide were from renewable resources. To make the use of these materials more competitive, we work on product inno vations based on renewable raw materials as well as on enhancing production processes in reaction technology and preparation.
We also further established our "biomass balance" a pproach on the market in 2016. The goal here is to replace natural gas and naphtha at the beginning of the value chain with biogas and bio-naphtha from certified sustainable production. Should a customer select a biomass-balanced product, the proportion of renewable feedstock to be used is calculated based on the formulation. The calculation is certified by an independent third party (TÜV Süd). Our Verbund production ensures that the properties and quality of all end products remain unchanged and that our customers can use them as usual. This method has already been applied for more than 40 BASF products ­ for example, for superabsorbents,

dispersions, plastics such as polyamides and polyurethanes, and for intermediates available on the market as "drop-in products." These can be used in place of previously employed products in the production process without having to change the process itself.
Together with Avantium, BASF established the Amsterdam- based Synvina C.V. joint venture in 2016 to produce and market furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from renewable resources. FDCA is a key chemical component of poly ethylenefuranoate (PEF), which will also be marketed by the joint venture. PEF has a broad application profile and is especially suitable for producing certain food packaging materials, such as films and plastic bottles. Compared with conventional plastics, PEF demonstrates higher barrier properties for gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen, leading to a longer shelf life for packaged products. In addition, its higher degree of mechanical strength allows for thinner ­ and therefore lighter ­ packaging. We also offer our customers 1,4-butanediol (BDO) on a commercial scale using sugars as a renewable feedstock, based on a licensing agreement with the company Genomatica Inc., headquartered in San Diego, California. We use BDO to produce bio-based polytetrahydrofuran 1000 (PolyTHF® 1000), which primarily serves as a chemical component in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), an ingredient used to m anufacture skis and roller skates, shoe soles, dashboard films in the automotive industry, and other products.
Palm oil, palm kernel oil, and their derivatives are some of our most important renewable raw materials. We want to e nsure that the raw materials stem from sustainable, certified sources and actively support the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Based on the voluntary commitment to sustainably source palm oil products that we expanded in 2015, we increased our purchase of certified palm kernel oil by around 32,000 metric tons to 158,000 metric tons in 2016. In addition, our new BASF Palm Sourcing Policy addresses the requirements for protecting and preserving forests and peatland, along with the involvement of local communities in decision-making processes, and we began its implementation together with our suppliers in 2016.
We have intensified our dialog with partners along the value chain. In order to involve smallholder farmers and improve their living conditions, BASF and Henkel are working together with the development organization Solidaridad to provide training for around 5,500 farmers in Indonesia. BASF also advanced the RSPO certification of its sites for cosmetic ingredients. In 2016, 19 production sites worldwide were a lready RSPO certified. Our goal is to only source palm oil and palm kernel oil with RSPO certification, provided it is available on the market. This voluntary commitment has been e xpanded to include the most important intermediate products based

BASF Report 2016 
on palm oil and palm kernel oil up to 2025; these include fractions and primary oleochemical derivatives as well as edible oil e sters.
We successfully completed our joint project with Cargill and the German governmental agency for international cooperation (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, or GIZ) on the sustainable production of coconut oil in the Philippines in 2015. Since then, small-holder farmers have been producing the world's first Rainforest Alliance-certified dried coconut meat (copra), from which the oil is extracted. In a follow-u p project, BASF is working together with Cargill, Proctor & Gamble and the GIZ to support the expansion of a certified and transparent supply chain for coconut oil in the Philippines and Indonesia. The project is being financed in part by the "develoPPP.de" program of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The project is also expected to result in improved income and living standards for around 3,600 small farmers.
BASF signed a contract in 2016 together with Arkema and Jayant Agro, along with the non-governmental organization Solidaridad, to promote sustainability in the castor oil supply chain. With the Sustainable Castor Initiative ­ Pragati, the project members want to improve the livelihood of castor oil farmers and their employees in India by helping them optimize their yield and reduce the impact on the environment. Furthermore, a sustainability code is being developed that will enable Indian farmers to offer the first certified sustainable castor oil on the global market. The project is initially scheduled to run for three years.

Mineral raw materials
We procure a number of mineral raw materials, like precious metals, that we use to produce process and mobile emissions catalysts. In suspected cases, we track the origins of minerals ­ as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act ­ to see if they come from mines in conflict regions. We reserve the right to conduct an external audit and, if necessary, terminate our business relationship. The suppliers addressed have confirmed to us that they do not source minerals matching this definition of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its neighboring countries.
BASF is observing the current development of a European regulation on conflict minerals that creates obligations for importers and processors of mineral raw materials originating from conflict regions.

Audits
 121 safety, security, health and environmental protection audits performed at 80 sites
Regular audits help ensure that standards are met for safety, security, health and environmental protection. We conduct audits at BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is a majority shareholder. We have defined our regulations for R esponsible Care audits in a global Group requirement. During our audits, we create a safety and environmental profile that shows if we are properly addressing the existing hazard potential. If this is not the case, we agree on measures and conduct follow-up audits on their implementation.
Our internal audit system complies with the standards for external auditing procedures ISO 19011 and OHSAS 18001. Worldwide, 155 BASF production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 14001 (2015: 180)1. In the BASF Group in 2016, 121 environmental, safety and security audits were carried out at 80 sites, along with 37 short-notice audits on various topics at 33 sites. We audited 30 sites with respect to occupational medicine and health protection.

Our regulations and measures for transportation and warehouse safety cover the delivery of raw materials, the storage and distribution of chemical products among BASF sites and customers, and the transportation of waste from our sites to the disposal facilities.
Strategy
In 2014, we had already nearly achieved the BASF Group goal of reducing the number of worldwide transportation accidents per 10,000 shipments by 70% from 2003 to 2020. Therefore, in our reporting on transportation incidents, we have focused since 2015 on dangerous goods spillages that significantly impacted the environment. We report on dangerous goods leaks of BASF products in excess of 200 kilograms on public transportation routes, provided BASF arranged the transport.
Transportation incidents
We recorded two incidents in 2016 with spillage of more than 200 kilograms of dangerous goods (2015: 2). None of these transportation incidents had a significant impact on the environment (2015: 0).
Accident prevention and emergency response
 Dangerous goods inspections expanded in contract management system
 Inspection program introduced for container barges
In order to ensure that our processes are even safer and create globally uniform standards, we introduced extended dangerous goods checks into our order management system in 2016.

We broadened the training opportunities for our employees and added new e-learning modules, such as the introduction of a multilingual training module in Europe on the road transportation of hazardous goods.
We stipulate worldwide requirements for our logistics service providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. In 2016, we evaluated around 370 companies in all regions. Our experts use our own evaluation and monitoring tools as well as internationally approved schemes.
We added container barges to our existing inspection program in 2016. This includes not only evaluating the vessels themselves, but also the management systems of the shipping companies to review their safety standards.
We regularly evaluate the risks in transporting raw materials with high hazard potential using our global guideline. It is based on the guidelines of the European Chemical Industry Council, CEFIC.
Activities in external networks
We are actively involved in external networks, which quickly provide information and assistance in emergencies. These include the International Chemical Environmental (ICE) initiative and the German Transport Accident Information and Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role. In 2016, we provided assistance to other companies in 176 cases worldwide. We apply the experience we have gathered to set up similar systems in other countries: For example, we intensified our activities in South America in 2016.

 Process safety and information protection at Global Safety Days
With our global safety initiative begun in 2008, we have created the conditions necessary for the continuous development of a safety culture. Process safety and information protection were the main theme of our 2016 Global Safety Days, carried out in more than 860 activities at around 350 sites. Topics included product spillage prevention; reducing environmental, health and safety hazard potential; and proper conduct in handling sensitive information. More than 75,000 employees and contractors around the world took active part. This commitment and vigorous exchange make a major contribution to our safety culture. At the Ludwigshafen site, employees and contractors can obtain continuous further education on

We have made it our goal to reduce the worldwide lost-time injury rate per one million working hours to 0.5 at most by 2025. To this end, we promote risk-conscious behavior and safe working practices for every individual, particularly through regular communication, systematic risk assessments, spec ific qualification measures and our worldwide safety initiatives.
We recorded around 118,000 enrollments in occupational safety training courses worldwide in 2016. These seminars comprise not only legally stipulated instructions, but also courses on safe procedures to strengthen our employees' risk-aware behavior and prevent work-related accidents.

2025 Goal
Reduction of worldwide lost-time injury rate per one million working hours

0.5

In 2016, 1.4 work-related accidents per one million working hours occurred at BASF sites worldwide (2015: 1.4), raising the rate of chemical-related accidents to 9% (2015: 8%). The rate of work-related accidents per one million working hours for contractors was at 1.5 in 2016 (2015: 1.41). Unfortunately, there were four incidents in 2016 with a total of seven fatalities (2015: two fatal work-related accidents). BASF is performing a comprehensive analysis of the incidents and using the findings to derive appropriate measures.
During maintenance work in Camaçari, Brazil, an employee of a crane company suffered fatal injuries when the crane he was operating tipped over. In May, an employee of an external company hired by BASF to perform maintenance work in Yeosu, South Korea, died from the effects of phosgene exposure. The cause of the accident was investigated by BASF and the relevant Korean authorities. In February 2017, the court respons ible for the case ruled that the accident was attributable to carelessness on the part of individual employees.

Although the court did not identify any technical or process defects, a small monetary penalty was nevertheless imposed on BASF. After the accident, BASF reviewed the safety measures and processes at all of its isocyan ate production sites worldwide and once again clarified these to employees. An employee of a subcontractor succumbed to his injuries after falling through a roof opening in Kuan Yin, Taiwan, in July.
In October, three employees of the BASF fire department lost their lives in an accident at the North Harbor of the Ludwigshafen site, along with one barge crewman on a tanker moored in the harbor. BASF had contracted a specialist company for pipeline construction to perform scheduled preventive maintenance on an emptied and secured propylene line at the North Harbor. Several pipeline sections were to be replaced. A fire broke out during the work, leading to an explosion and ensuing fires in other pipelines. Six of the severely injured were discharged from the hospital in December; another was kept in the hospital for inpatient treatment. Light injuries were sustained by 22 people in the accident. The district attorney's office of the city of Frankenthal is investigating the accident. BASF is supporting assessors and authorities in their inspections and has also hired an independent expert to analyze the causes of the accident.

Our worldwide standards for occupational medicine and health protection are specified in a directive that is implemented by a global network of experts. Our global health management serves to promote and maintain the health and productivity of our employees. This was supported by numerous emergency drills and health promotion measures in 2016.
We measure our performance in health protection using the Health Performance Index (HPI). The HPI comprises five components: confirmed occupational diseases, medical emergency drills, first aid, preventive medicine and health promotion. Each component contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score. The highest possible score is 1.0. Our goal is to reach a value of more than 0.9 every year.

With an HPI of 0.96, we were once again able to fulfill the ambitious goal of exceeding 0.9 each year (2015: 0.97). Our 2016 global health campaign for employees centered on heart attack and stroke prevention. To obtain a self-evaluation of their heart's age and their risk of heart attack and stroke, our employees filled out around 32,000 questionnaires worldwide. The offer included personal recommendations for individual risk factors and contact with a physician in the case of increased risk.

Process safety

 Expanded initiative for reducing process safety incidents
 Enhanced training methods

We use the number of process safety incidents as a key performance indicator, following to a large extent the definition set by the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). In 2016, we recorded 2.0 process safety incidents per one million working hours worldwide (2015: 2.1). We pursue continual improvement by investigating every incident in detail, analyzing root causes and using the findings to derive suitable measures. We set ourselves the goal of reducing process safety incidents to a rate of no more than 0.5 per one million working hours by 2025.

2025 Goal

BASF Report 2016

Our globally implemented management system for process safety provides the framework for the safe construction and operation of our plants as well as the protection of people and the environment. Our experts have developed a protection plan for every plant that considers the key aspects of safety, health and environmental protection ­ from conception to startup ­ and stipulates specific protection measures for each. We continued to review this management system in all regions in 2016.
In order to maintain the highest level of safety at our plants across their entire life cycle, we review the implementation of our protection plans in all facilities at regular intervals and depending on hazard potential. We use globally standardized software to track these safety assessments. One module of this program ­ already used in many of our plants ­ checks the timely implementation of stipulated measures, supporting our employees in production. We supplemented this in 2016 by updating a global recommendation for prioritizing safety measures.
To strengthen risk awareness, we enhanced our training methods, introduced global recommendations for training measures and instructed around 13,000 course participants.
For more on process safety, see basf.com/process_safety
Emergency response
 Regular review of emergency systems  Global qualification program for emergency
response teams
In order to ensure uniformly high standards around the world for safety, security, health and environmental protection, we continued to implement our requirements for emergency response planning and fire prevention in the BASF Group in 2016. We work, for example, with site-specific emergency response plans and actively involve situation-related partners and suppliers as well as cities, communities and neighboring companies.
We regularly check our emergency systems and drill procedures with employees, contractors and local authorities. Through 173 drills and simulations in 2016, we instructed participants in our emergency response measures. One topic, for example, revolved around collaboration between production facilities and the fire department.
Through our SPIDER Emergency Response and Information Center Verbund, our specialists from the site fire department, emergency medical team, site security, and environmental protection can work together quickly and reliably across different sites around Europe. Our central emergency response supports local emergency response units around the world and around the clock.

We have been using the KATWARN system at the Ludwigs
hafen site since 2015, an app-based warning system that serves as an additional information channel to quickly inform site employees and neighbors of dangerous situations. We are constantly improving its use.
We developed a global qualification program in 2016 to train our emergency response teams. All over the world, mentors from the BASF SE fire department support local emer gency response instructors at the sites with their knowledge, contributing to safety.
For more on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency_response
Corporate security
 Worldwide network of information protection officers
We protect our employees, sites and company know-how against third-party interference, and establish the necessary framework worldwide with our uniform concepts. Audits enable us to check the implementation of these measures.
New online training courses are available to our employees to prepare them for travel. Business travelers, transferees, and employees in countries with elevated security risks are informed about appropriate protection measures and individually counseled where necessary. After any major incident, we now have the possibility of more quickly and accurately locating employees in the affected regions through a travel research system that was globally standardized in 2016.
Aspects of human rights related to site security, such as the right to liberty and security of person, are a component of the global qualification requirements of our security personnel. Respect for human rights is a mandatory element of any contract with service providers of the BASF Group who are active in this area. Our investment projects include performing comprehensive analyses of potential risks. In 2016, we standardized the use of security services at further European sites in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency.
Due to the increasing risks associated with the use of information technology, a global campaign for employees is drawing attention to how we can even better protect our company knowledge. For example, a global phishing simulation further strengthened our employees' awareness of risks. Our worldwide network of information protection officers comprises more than 650 employees. They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and conduct seminars on secure behaviors. We provided information protection instruction to more than 27,000 participants in 2016. In addition, we published standardized Group-wide recommendations for the protection of information and knowledge.

 Global directives with uniformly high standards for product stewardship

In addition, we are also involved in workshops and training seminars in developing countries and emerging markets. In 2016, for example, we conducted training sessions for chemical industry representatives on GPS in China, India and Kenya on safe chemical management. In order to facilitate public access to information, we are participating in the setup of an ICCA online portal that provides more than 4,600 GPS safety summaries.
For more on GPS, see basf.com/en/gps
Global goal

We ensure uniformly high standards for product stewardship worldwide and our voluntary initiatives go beyond legal requirements. We monitor the compliance of our guidelines with regular audits.
We provide extensive information on our chemical sales products to our customers with safety data sheets in more than 40 languages. This is achieved with the help of a global database in which we maintain and evaluate continuously u pdated environmental, health and safety data for our substances and products. Our global emergency hotline network provides information around the clock. We train and support our customers in fulfilling their industry-specific or application- specific product requirements.
The Care Chemicals division, for example, is involved in the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients, EFfCI. Together with other producers of cosmetic ingredients, we discuss the best way to cover our customers' demand for information. The aim is to enable them to ensure the safety of the cosmetic products they manufacture in accordance with current scientific knowledge. This includes knowledge that extends back along the value chain to the production pro cesses of the chemical raw materials used.
The Intermediates division supports information exchange with customers who manufacture ingredients for personal end-user products. For example, BASF customers such as industrial producers of raw materials for consumer goods are specifically addressed and advised by BASF's experts as soon as a change is observed in the risk assessment of materials used in the production process.
With our global risk assessment goal, we are supporting the implementation of initiatives such as the Global Product Strategy (GPS) of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). GPS is establishing worldwide standards and best practices to improve the safe management of chemical substances.

By 2020, we will conduct risk assessments for all substances and mixtures BASF sells worldwide in quantities of more than one metric ton per year. We already reached 75.4% of this goal in 2016 (2015: 67.8%). The risk associated with using a substance is determined by the combination of its hazardous properties and its potential exposure to people and the environment.

REACH and other legal requirements
 Third registration phase of REACH in progress
We are working continuously on registering substances produced in annual volumes between one and one hundred metric tons for the third phase of the E.U. chemicals regulation, REACH. We have already registered over 250 substances to this end. Moreover, our REACH activities are increasingly determined by E.U. authorities' decisions on additional studies in connection with the evaluation of submitted dossiers. Independently of this, BASF is also obligated to continuously u pdate the registration dossiers it has submitted. The number of u pdates has meanwhile exceeded the number of registrations, although over 90% of the updates are undertaken on our own initiative and not as a response to official inquiry.
We apply the experience we have gathered with REACH to fulfill new legal requirements around the world, such as in Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. In 2016, we submitted more than 8,000 preregistrations in Taiwan in order to secure our b usiness activities there.
In an increasingly political agrochemical environment, we are facing a rise in both regulatory requirements and the number of additional studies required to obtain or extend approval for crop protection products.

 Use of alternative and complementary methods for animal studies
Before launching products on the market, we subject them to a variety of environmental and toxicological testing. We apply state-of-the-art knowledge already in the research and development phase of our products. We only conduct animal studies when they are required by law and approved by respective authorities. Animal studies are at times stipulated by REACH and other national legislation outside the European Union in order to obtain more information on the properties and effects of chemical products.
We adhere to the specifications laid down by the German Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ­ the highest standard for laboratory animals in the world. We are continually developing and optimizing alternative and complementary methods, and we use them wherever it is possible and approved by the authorities. We use alternative and complementary methods in more than a third of our tests. Currently, 30 replacement and supplementary methods are being used in our labs and another 12 are in the development stage. BASF spent 3.0 million toward this purpose in 2016. One focus area of our research in 2016 and subsequent years is the development of alternative methods for testing the potential of substances that negatively affect organisms' growth and development.
In 2016, our Experimental Toxicology and Ecotoxicology department began work together with a total of 39 partners on one of the largest European collaborative projects for alternative methods. The project, planned to run for six years, aims to develop alternative methods to the point that chemical risk assessments can be efficiently conducted largely without animal testing.

Management of new technologies
 Continual safety research on nano- and biotechnology

the safety of nanomaterials. We published the results in over 100 scientific articles. One important finding is that toxicity is determined not by the size of the particles but by the intrinsic properties of the substance.
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as well as the OECD and national authorities are currently developing regulatory concepts to test and assess nanomaterials. We contribute our expertise through various working groups, such as the Partner Expert Groups (PEGs) of the ECHA or the Business and Industry Advisory Group (BIAC) of the OECD. These regulatory concepts are all based on a new approach for the targeted investigation of nanomaterials. We developed them together with the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) and other experts and e xpanded them further using concrete examples in 2016.
An important prerequisite for the consistent application of regulatory specifications for nanomaterials is their clear identification. Together with partners, we have developed a tiered, efficient measurement method in various E.U. projects that is currently being validated for use in REACH.
Transparency is another issue. In our Nano dialog forum, we meet with environmental and consumer agencies to discuss questions on nanomaterial safety and transparency and develop joint recommendations for political representatives. We wrapped up another series of talks in BASF's Nano dialog forum with a report and an event in Brussels in 2016.
BASF makes successful use of biotechnology. We produce a range of established products with the help of biotechnological methods. This provides us with a great wealth of experience in the safe use of biotechnological methods in research and development as well as in production. When employing biotechnology, we adhere to all standards and legal regulations. We are guided by the code of conduct set out by EuropaBio, the European biotechnology association that actively supports a science-based, transparent and predictable regulatory framework. The association addresses society's ethical concerns, and promotes better mutual understanding of such issues through dialog.
For more on nanotechnology and the Nanotechnology Code of Conduct, see basf.com/nanotechnology

Technologies such as nanotechnology or biotechnology offer solutions for key societal challenges ­ for example, in the areas of climate protection or health and nutrition.
Safe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology Code of Conduct. We are constantly expanding our knowledge of nanomaterial safety. Over recent years, we have conducted more than 240 toxicological and ecotoxicological studies and participated in over 30 different projects related to

Customers

As an energy-intensive company, we are committed to energy efficiency and global climate protection. We want to reduce emissions along the value chain and utilize, for example, efficient technologies for generating steam and electricity, energy-efficient production processes, and comprehensive energy management. Our climate protection products make an important contribution toward helping our customers avoid emissions.
Strategy
 We are committed to energy efficiency and global c limate protection along the value chain
We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our production and along the entire value chain. To this end, we have thoroughly analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions from our production in the past few years and implemented comprehensive reduction measures. This is how, for example, we have been able to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by more than 95% since 1997.
Comparisons with European emissions trading benchmarks show that our greenhouse gas-intensive chemical plants operate at above-average efficiency. To supply our production sites with energy, we rely on highly efficient combined heat and power plants with gas and steam turbines, and on the use of heat released by production processes. Around 50% of BASF Group emissions in 2016 resulted from steam and electricity generation in our power plants as well as in our energy suppliers' power plants.
Our success also depends on the long-term security and competitiveness of our energy supplies. Furthermore, we are committed to energy management that helps us analyze and further improve the energy efficiency of our plants.
We offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy and resource efficiency. Around half of our total annual research and development spending goes toward developing these products and optimizing our processes.

Our climate protection activities are based on comprehensive emissions controlling. We report on greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard, as well as the sector-specific standard for the chemical industry. Since 2004, we have participated in the international non-profit organization CDP's program for reporting on data relevant to climate protection. Reporting to CDP entails an annual analysis performed by our experts of the opportunities and risks that climate change poses for BASF. BASF achieved a score of A- in CDP's rating for 2016, awarding it "Leadership" status. Companies on the "Leadership" level are distinguished by factors such as the completeness and trans parency of their reporting. They also pursue comprehensive approaches in managing the opportunities and risks associated with climate change as well as emissions reduction strategies to achieve company-wide goals.
We advocate climate protection by supporting initiatives to this end. The G20 Summit will take place in Hamburg in July 2017, an annual meeting between leaders of state and government of the most influential industrialized countries and emerging markets. Companies from 20 countries ­ the B usiness 20 (B20) ­ are working on recommendations for these political leaders. BASF is leading the working group on energy, climate and resource efficiency. The group especially aims for a political environment that enables companies like BASF to make essential contributions to climate protection using their power of innovation.

1 BASF reports separately on direct and indirect emissions from the purchase of energy. Scope 1 emissions encompass both direct emissions from production and generation of steam and electricity, as well as direct emissions from the generation of steam and electricity for sale. Scope 2 emissions comprise indirect emissions from the purchase of energy for BASF`s use.
2 Emissions of N2O, CH4, HFC und SF6 have been translated into CO2 emissions using the Global Warming Potential, or GWP, factor. GWP factors are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1995 (2002 emissions) and IPCC 2007, errata table 2012 (2015 and 2016 emissions). HFC (hydrofluorocarbons) are calculated using the GWP factors of the individual components.

Global goals
 Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per metric ton of sales product
 Introduction of energy management systems in accordance with ISO 50001
We aim to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions per metric ton of sales product by 40% by 2020, compared with baseline 2002. In 2016, we achieved a reduction of 37.2% (2015: reduction of 34.6%). Since 1990, we have been able to lower our overall greenhouse gas emissions from BASF operations (excluding Oil & Gas) by 50.2% and even reduce specific emissions by 75.4%.
We set ourselves a new energy efficiency goal in 2015 covering both the chemicals and the oil and gas businesses. By 2020, we want to have introduced certified energy management systems (DIN EN ISO 50001) at all relevant production sites5. Taken together, this represents 90% of BASF's primary energy demand. This is one of the ways in which we intend to identify and carry out improvements in energy efficiency, reducing not only greenhouse gas emissions and saving valuable energy resources, but also increasing the BASF Group's competitive ability.

In 2016, workshops were conducted in all regions to introduce our energy management systems. This is how, for example, an energy savings potential of over 1 million per year was identified during system implementation at three pilot plants at the largest South American site in Guaratinguetá, Brazil. It is already starting to be realized. All energy efficiency measures are recorded and analyzed in a global database and made available to Group sites as best practices. Currently, over 100 measures are being pursued to reduce energy consumption and increase competitive ability. External audits in accordance with ISO 50001 were already conducted at the first two Chinese sites in the Shanghai metropolitan region in 2016. At the moment, 31 sites are certified worldwide, representing 42.3% of our primary energy demand.

5 The selection of relevant sites is determined by the amount of primary energy used and local energy prices.

Energy supply and efficiency
 Verbund system as important component of our energy efficiency strategy

We were able to further optimize the resource and energy consumption of our production in numerous projects around the world in 2016. New highly efficient combined heat and power plants started up at the German sites in Düsseldorf- Holthausen and Illertissen as well as at Pontecchio Marconi in Italy. Furthermore, process improvements at many additional sites have led to savings in steam and electricity.
We also rely on locally available energy sources for energy supply at our sites. Especially in the growing Asian market, we and our energy suppliers also utilize coal as an energy source since the more climate-friendly natural gas is not available in sufficient quantities at competitive prices.
We are exploring the use of renewable energies. These can only become a permanent part of our energy mix if they are competitive in terms of supply security and cost. Our research also contributes to increasing the efficiency of technologies for the use of renewable energy sources.

Gas and steam turbines in our combined heat and power plants enable us to fulfill around 70% of the electricity demand of the BASF Group. Compared with separate methods of generating steam and electricity, we saved 14.0 million MWh of fossil fuels and prevented 2.8 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2016. The Verbund system is an important component of our energy efficiency strategy: Waste heat from one plant's production process is used as energy in other plants. In this way, the Verbund saved us around 19.0 million MWh in 2016, which translates to 3.8 million metric tons less of CO2 released to the environment. With combined power and steam generation as well as our continuously enhanced Energy Verbund, we were thus able to prevent a total of 6.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2016.

Carbon footprint and climate protection products
 Reporting on greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain
 Customers' use of climate protection products sold in 2016 avoids 540 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents
BASF has been publishing a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint since as early as 2008. This reports on all emissions along the value chain and shows the volume of emissions prevented through the use of our climate protection products. We plan our climate protection activities along the value chain based on our corporate carbon footprint.
Through various measures to reduce our raw material and energy requirements, the emission of greenhouse gases associated with producing the raw materials was decreased by a total of around 155,000 metric tons in 2016.
Our climate protection products help us offer solutions to our customers to avoid greenhouse gas emissions over their entire lifecycle as compared with reference products. According to the systematic sustainability analysis we conduct on our portfolio ­ using the Sustainable Solution Steering® method ­ such products are referred to as "Accelerator" solutions as using them contributes positively to climate protection and energy. One example is our Green Sense® Concrete tech nology for sustainable construction: The optimization of the concrete's composition allows for reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional concrete production.

Water is of fundamental importance in chemical production. It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, as well as to make our products. We are committed to its responsible use along the entire value chain and especially in our production sites' water catchment areas. We have set ourselves a global goal for sustainable water management.
Strategy
 Sustainable water management
We aim to use water as sparingly as possible and further reduce emissions to water. To do so, we have set out a Group directive with globally applicable standards.
We are introducing sustainable water management at all relevant production sites. These include our major Verbund sites as well as the sites in water stress areas, or regions in which more than 60% of available water is used by industry, household and agriculture. We consider the quantitative, qualitative and social a spects of water use. We want to identify where we can improve at our sites, and use as little water as possible, especially in water stress areas.
Together with the city of Guaratinguetá, Brazil, and the Fundação Espaço ECO®, we are engaged in the restoration of the local river basin at our site in Guaratinguetá, Brazil, which provides 90% of the local population's water supply. These efforts aim to improve water quality and increase its availability.

We offer our customers solutions that help purify water and use it more efficiently while minimizing pollution.
In order to ensure transparency in our reporting on water, we once again took part in CDP reporting in 2016. According to CDP, an international nonprofit organization, BASF is a world leader in sustainable water management and was included for the first time in CDP's Water A List. Of the 607 companies evaluated, only 24 of them received the top score of "A" ­ among them, BASF. CDP's evaluation of sustainable water management includes how transparently companies report on their water management activities and what they do to reduce risks, such as water scarcity. CDP also assesses the extent to which product developments ­ even at the customers of the companies under evaluation ­ can contribute to sustainable water management.
For more on the CDP water survey, see basf.com/en/cdp
Global goal
By 2025, we want to introduce sustainable water management at all sites in water stress areas and at our Verbund sites, covering 93% of BASF's entire water abstraction. We achieved 42.6% of this goal in 2016.

We pursue our goal by applying the European Water Stewardship standard, which rests on four principles: sustainable w ater abstraction, maintaining good water quality, preserving conservation areas, and ensuring continuous improvement processes, including in cooperation with other users.
In 2016, around 23% of our production sites were located in water stress areas. Around 1% of BASF's total water supply was abstracted from these sites.

The supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is associated with a considerable energy demand. We employ various means in our efforts to minimize this as much as p ossible. We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business and the environment.

Water use
 Using water responsibly
Our water usage totaled 1,649 million cubic meters in 2016. This demand was covered for the most part by surface water, such as rivers and lakes. At some sites, we use alternative sources such as treated municipal wastewater, brackish water or seawater, reducing our need for freshwater.
We predominantly use water for cooling purposes (85%), after which we recirculate it back to our supply sources. We recirculate as much water as possible in order to withdraw less. Our larger sites have recooling plants that allow water to be reused several times and which reduce the temperature of used cooling water before it is discharged back into a body of water.

 Further reduction of emissions
A total of 1,644 million cubic meters of water were discharged from BASF production sites in 2016, including 184 million cubic meters of wastewater from production. Emissions of nitrogen to water amounted to 2,900 metric tons (2015: 3,000 metric tons). We were able to achieve this improvement by optimizing processes and exchanging products, for example. Around 15,900 metric tons of organic substances were emitted in wastewater (2015: 17,300 metric tons). Our wastewater contained 23 metric tons of heavy metals (2015: 25 metric tons). Phosphorus emissions amounted to 310 metric tons (2015: 460 metric tons). Our wastewater is treated through different methods depending on the type and degree of contamination ­ including biological processes, oxidation, membrane technologies, precipitation or adsorption.
In order to avoid unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface or groundwater, we create water protection strategies for our production sites. This is mandatory for all production plants as part of the Responsible Care initiative. The wastewater protection plans involve evaluating wastewater in terms of risk and drawing up suitable monitoring approaches. We use audits to check that these measures are being implemented and complied with.

We want to further reduce emissions to air from our production, prevent waste and protect the soil. We have set ourselves standards for doing so in global directives. If no recovery options are available for waste, we dispose of it in a proper and environmentally responsible manner.
Strategy
 Regular monitoring of emissions to air  Professional disposal of hazardous waste  Systematic management of contaminated sites
Regular monitoring of our emissions to air is a part of environmental management at BASF. Aside from greenhouse gases, we also measure emissions of other pollutants into the atmosphere. Our reporting does not take into account air pollutant emissions from oil and gas operations due to their substantial fluctuation during exploration phases.
Our Raw Material Verbund helps us prevent and reduce waste. We regularly carry out audits to inspect external waste disposal companies, ensuring that our hazardous waste in particular is properly disposed of. In this way, we also contribute to preventive soil protection and keep today's waste from becoming tomorrow's contamination.
When treatment is required for soil and groundwater contamination at active and former BASF sites, proper remediation measures are reviewed based on prevailing legal and current technical standards, and undertaken as necessary.

Emissions to air
 Further reduction of emissions
Absolute emissions of air pollutants from our chemical plants amounted to 26,735 metric tons in 2016. Emissions of ozone-depleting substances as defined by the Montreal Protocol totaled 25 metric tons in 2016 (2015: 23 metric tons). Emissions of heavy metals in 2016 amounted to 3 metric tons (2015: 4 metric tons).
Our product portfolio contains a variety of catalysts used in the automotive sector and in industry to reduce the emission of air pollutants.

Risk management
Identifying opportunities and risks as early as possible
and planning effective courses of action

The goal of BASF's risk management is to identify and evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and to take appropriate measures in order to seize opportunities and limit business losses. The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF's continued existence and to make improved managerial decisions to create value. We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact the achievement of our short-term operational or longterm strategic goals. We define opportunities as potential successes that exceed our defined goals.
In order to effectively measure and manage identified opportunities and risks, we quantify these in terms of probability and economic impact in the event they occur. We use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk factors. This way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks at a portfolio level, allowing us to take effective measures for risk management.
Overall assessment
 Significant risks and opportunities arise from overall economic developments and volatility in exchange rates and margins
For 2017, we expect the global economy to continue to grow at around the same pace as the previous year. Important opportunities and risks for our earnings are associated with uncertainty regarding market growth, the development of key customer industries, and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and margins. A considerable slowdown of the Chinese economy continues to pose significant risks. Such a development would negatively impact demand for intermediate and investment goods. This would impact the emerging markets that export raw materials as well as the advanced economies. This is especially true for Europe. Further risks to the global economy arise from an escalation of geopolitical conflicts and an increased tendency toward protectionism.

According to our assessment, there continue to be no significant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of the BASF Group. The same applies to the sum of indiv idual risks, even in the case of another global economic crisis.
Ultimately, however, residual risks remain in all entrepreneurial activities which even comprehensive risk management cannot exclude.

Risk management process
 Integrated process for identification, assessment and reporting
 Decentralized management of specific opportunities and risks
 Aggregation at a Group level
The BASF Group's risk management process is based on the international risk management standard COSO II Enterprise Risk Management ­ Integrated Framework (2004), and has the following key features:
Organization and responsibilities ­­Risk management is the responsibility of the Board of Execu
tive Directors, which also determines the processes for a pproving investments, acquisitions and divestitures. ­­The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the units Finance; Corporate Controlling; Strategic Planning & C ontrolling; Legal, Taxes, Insurance & Intellectual Property; and the Chief Compliance Officer. Effective January 1, 2017, the Finance corporate unit and the Legal, Taxes, Insurance and Intellectual Property corporate unit were both renamed functional units. Competence centers were relabeled either functional units or research units. The Strategic Planning & Controlling unit is now called Corporate Development. The new nomenclature had no effect on the existing risk management processes. The aforementioned units continue to coordinate the risk management process at a Group level and provide the structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and risk management is thus integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes. ­­A network of risk managers in the business, research, functional and corporate units advances the implementation of appropriate risk management practices in daily operations. ­­The management of specific opportunities and risks is largely delegated to the business units and is steered at a regional or local level. Risks relating to exchange rates and raw

material prices are an exception. In this case, there is an initial consolidation at a Group-wide level before derivative hedging instruments, for example, are used. ­­BASF's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) manages the implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported by additional compliance officers worldwide. The CCO regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on progress in the program's implementation as well as on any significant results. Furthermore, the CCO provides a status report to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee at least once each year, including any major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors. ­­The internal auditing unit (Corporate Audit) is responsible for regularly auditing the risk management system established by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act. Furthermore, as part of its monitoring of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board considers the effectiveness of the risk management system. The suitability of the early detection system we set up for risks is evaluated by our external auditor.
Instruments ­­The Risk Management Process Manual, applicable through-
out the Group, forms the framework for risk management and is implemented by the business units according to their particular business conditions. ­­A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps to identify all relevant opportunities and risks as comprehensively as possible. ­­We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the identification and assessment of risks. The aggregation of opportunities, risks and sensitivities at the business and Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects and trends across the company. ­­The BASF Group's management is informed about operational opportunities and risks (observation period of up to

one year) in the monthly management report produced by the Corporate Controlling unit. In addition, Corporate Controlling and Finance provide information twice a year on the aggregated opportunity/risk exposure of the BASF Group. Furthermore, if a new individual risk is identified which has a more than 10 million impact on earnings or bears reputational risks, it must be immediately reported. ­­As part of our strategy development, the Corporate Development unit conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with a ten-year assessment period. These analyses are annually reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if necessary. ­­Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company's internal guidelines. Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards into everyday business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also e xpressly obligated to follow these principles.

Significant features of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the Group financial reporting process
 Conducted in accordance with standardized Group guidelines
 Segregation of duties, four-eyes principle, and clearly regulated access rights
 Annual evaluation of control environment and relevant processes at significant companies
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by a unit in the Finance division. BASF Group's accounting process is based on a standardized accounting guideline that sets out accounting policies and the significant processes and deadlines on a Group-wide basis. There are binding directives for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant in these processes.
Employees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and regional service units involved. We strictly adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or the "four-eyes principle." Complex actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualified employees.

An internal control system for financial reporting continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are provided to ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial reporting is structured and uniform across the BASF Group.
The significant risks for the BASF Group regarding a reliable control environment for proper financial reporting are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.
Moreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. In the relevant companies, one person is given the responsibility of monitoring the execution of the annual evaluation process.
In these companies, the process comprises the following steps: ­­Evaluation of the control environment
Adherence to internal and external guidelines that are relevant for the maintenance of a reliable control environment is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire and evidenced by sample taking. ­­Identification and documentation of control activities In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control activities are documented. ­­Assessment of control activities After documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks. In the subsequent test phase, samples are taken to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and effective. ­­Monitoring of control weaknesses The managers responsible receive reports on any control weaknesses identified and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance for the BASF Group. The Board of Executive Directors and the Audit Committee are informed once control weaknesses have been identified that have a considerable impact on financial reporting. Only after material control weaknesses have been resolved does the company's managing director confirm the effective internal control system. ­­Internal confirmation of the internal control system All managing directors and chief financial officers of each consolidated Group company must confirm to the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE every half-year and at the end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.

Short-term opportunities and risks

Competition

Development of demand
The development of our sales markets is one of the strongest sources of opportunities and risks. More details on our assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, can be found from pages 119 to 121.
We also consider risks from deviations in assumptions. We continue to see a significant macroeconomic risk in an increased slowdown of the Chinese economy, which would have considerable impact on demand for intermediate goods for industrial production as well as investment goods. This would have an effect on emerging markets that export raw materials as well as on advanced economies that specialize in technological goods. Risks to the global economy would also be posed by the possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts and an increased tendency toward protectionism.
Should the macroeconomic environment develop more weakly than we predict, we expect a lower oil price. In this case, we would also expect the euro to depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar as compared with our planning assumptions, as the eurozone's economy shows a high level of dependency on exports and, in times of global economic weakness, the U.S. dollar is preferred by portfolio investors as a safe haven.
Weather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our crop protection business.

We continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to maintain competitive ability. We watch the market and the competition, and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities and counter emerging risks with fitting measures. Aside from innovation, a major component of competitiveness is a suitable cost structure in order to achieve good business performance on the market.
Regulation and political risks
Risks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, the destabilization of political systems or new trade sanctions. In addition, risks to the BASF Group can be posed by further regulations on the use or registration of agricultural and other chemicals.
The German federal government's agreement with the E.U. Commission on the treatment of existing self-generated energy in the new Renewable Energy Act (Erneuerbare- Energien-Gesetz, or EEG) has removed the previously reported risk of sharply increased charges resulting from the EEG surcharge.
We view the worldwide expansion of renewable energy and measures to increase energy efficiency as an opportunity for increased demand for our products. For example, we offer solutions for wind turbines in addition to insulation foams for buildings. Our catalyst business benefits from the tightening of automobile emissions regulations.

Margin volatility

Purchasing and supply chain

We anticipate generally stable margins for the BASF Group in 2017. For some products and value chains, it is possible that margin pressure could be increased by, for example, new capacities or increasing raw material costs. This would have a negative effect on our EBIT.
The year's average oil price for Brent crude was around $44 per barrel in 2016, compared with $52 in the previous year. For 2017, we anticipate an average oil price of $55 per barrel. We therefore expect a moderate increase in price levels for the raw materials and petrochemical basic products that are important to our business. Yet an oil price level below the expected average would pose risks for our oil and gas business, whose EBIT dips by approximately 20 million for every $1 decrease in the average annual barrel price of Brent crude.

We minimize procurement risks through our broad portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of raw materials on spot markets, as well. If possible, we avoid procuring raw materials from a single supplier. When this cannot be avoided, we try to foster competition or we knowingly enter into this relationship and assess the consequences of potential non delivery. We continuously monitor the credit risk of important business partners.
Production and investments
We try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high technical standards and by continuously improving our plants. We reduce the effects of unscheduled shutdowns on the supply of intermediate and end products through diversification within our global production Verbund.
In the event of a production outage ­ caused by an accident, for example ­ our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are e ngaged, depending on the impact scope. Every region has crisis management teams on a local and regional level. They

BASF Report 2016 

Management's Report 115
Forecast -- Opportunities and risks report

not only coordinate the necessary emergency response measures, they also initiate the immediate measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations as quickly as possible.
Short-term risks from investments can result from, for example, technical malfunctions or schedule and budget breaches. We counter these risks with highly experienced project management and controlling.
For more on emergency response, see page 100 or basf.com/emergency_response
Acquisitions, divestitures and cooperations
We are constantly watching our environment in order to identify possible targets and develop our portfolio appropriately. In addition, we work together in collaborations with customers and partners to jointly develop new, competitive products and applications.
Personnel
Due to BASF's worldwide compensation principles, the development of personnel expenses is partly dependent on the amount of variable compensation, which is linked to the company's success, among other factors. The correlation between variable compensation and the success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk. Another factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension obligations. Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a particular country can have an impact on the development of personnel expenses for the BASF Group. For countries in which BASF is active, relevant developments are therefore constantly monitored in order to recognize risks at an early stage and enable BASF to carry out suitable measures.
For more on our compensation system, see page 44 onward For more on risks from pension obligations, see page 117
Information technology risks
BASF relies on a number of IT systems. Their nonavailability, violation of confidentiality or the manipulation of data in critical IT systems and applications can all have a direct impact on production and logistics processes. The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology, and have far more resources available. If data are lost or manipulated, this can, for example, negatively affect process safety and the accuracy of our financial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records, competition-related information or research results, can result in legal conse quences or jeopardize our competitive position. This would also be accomp anied by the associated loss of reputation.

To minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and systems to ensure IT security, such as stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access protection and encryption systems as well as integrated, Group-wide standardized IT infrastructure and applications. The systems used for information security are constantly tested, continuously updated, and expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. IT-related risk management is conducted using Group-wide regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal control system based on these regulations.
BASF also established a Cyber Defense Center in 2015; is a member of the Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics e.V. (CSSA); and is a founding member of the German Cyber Security Organization (DCSO) together with Allianz SE, Bayer AG and Volkswagen AG.
Legal dispute and proceedings
We constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own analysis and assessment of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in individual cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is particularly based on estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range of possible claims. These estimates are the result of close cooperation between the affected operating and functional units together with the Legal and Finance units. If sufficient probability is identified, a provision is recognized accordingly for each dispute. Should a provision be unnecessary, general risk management continues to assess whether these litigations nevertheless present a risk for the EBIT of the BASF Group.
We use our internal control system to limit risks from p otential infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try to avoid patent and licensing disputes whenever possible through extensive clearance research. As part of our Groupwide Compliance Program, our employees receive regular training.

Financial opportunities and risks

Liquidity risks

The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is conducted in the Treasury unit. The management of commodity price risks takes place in the Procurement functional unit or in the appropriately authorized Group companies. Detailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial risks. Among other things, they provide for the segregation of trading and back office functions.
Exchange rate volatility
Our competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluc tuations in exchange rates. For BASF's purchasing, oppor tunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar e xchange rate fluctuates. A full-year rise in the value of the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate by $0.01 would result in an increase of around 40 million in the BASF Group's EBIT, assuming other conditions remain the same. On the production side, we counter foreign currency risks by producing in the respective currency zones.
Financial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS 21 at the closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies in our financial foreign currency risk management. These risks are hedged using derivative instruments, if necessary.
Interest rate risks
Interest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing market interest rates. These can cause a change in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments and fluctuations in the interest payments for variable-rate instruments, which would positively or negatively affect earnings. To hedge these risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency deriva tives are used in individual cases.
In addition to market interest rates, BASF's financing costs are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid. These are mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result thanks to the well-balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness.

Risks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit lines. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against potential refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various financial markets.
For more on financial risks, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 208 onward For more on the maturity profile of our financial indebtedness, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 204 onward
Risk of asset losses
We limit country-specific risks with measures based on internally determined country ratings, which are continuously updated to reflect changing environment conditions. We selectively use investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit risks for our financial investm ents by engaging in transactions only with banks with good credit ratings and by adhering to fixed limits. Creditworthiness is continuously monitored and the limits are adjusted accordingly. We reduce the risk of default on receivables by continuously monitoring the creditworthiness and payment behavior of our customers and by setting appropriate credit limits. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there are no major concentrations of credit d efault risk. Risks are also limited through the use of credit insurance and bank guarantees.
Impairment risks
The risk of an asset impairment occurs if the assumed interest rate in an impairment test increases, the predicted cash flows decline, or investment projects are suspended. In the current business environment, we consider the risk of impairment of individual assets such as customer relationships, technologies and trademarks, as well as goodwill, to be nonmaterial. Nevertheless, a continuing decline in the price of oil below our assumed planning level would result in impairment risks for the Oil & Gas segment's assets.

Risks from metal and raw materials trading

In the catalysts business, BASF employs commodity derivatives for precious metals and trades precious metals on behalf of third parties and on its own account. In addition, we use our knowledge of the markets for crude oil and oil products to generate earnings from the trade of raw materials. To address specific risks associated with these trades, which are not part of our operating business, we set and continuously monitor limits with regard to the type and size of the deals concluded.

Long-term incentive program for senior executives

Development of competitive and customer landscape

Our senior executives have the opportunity to participate in a share-price-based compensation program. The need for provisions for this program varies according to the development of the BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals Index; this leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.
Risks from pension obligations
Most employees are granted company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We predominantly finance company pension obligations externally through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. To address the risk of underfunding due to market- related fluctuations in plan assets, we have investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses. An adjustment to the interest rates used in discounting pension obligations leads immediately to changes in equity. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, employees have been almost exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service in recent years.
Long-term opportunities and risks
Long-term demand development
We assume that chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will grow considerably faster than global gross domestic product over the next five years and at about the same level as the previous five-year average. Through our market-oriented and broad portfolio, which we will continue to strengthen in the years ahead through investments in new production capacities, research and development activities and acquisitions, we aim to achieve sales growth that slightly exceeds this market growth. Should global economic growth see unexpected, considerable deceleration, due for example to an ongoing weak period in the emerging markets or to geopolitical crises, the expected growth rates could prove too ambitious. As a result of our high degree of diversification across various customer industries and regions, we would still expect our growth to be above the market average, even under these conditions.
For more on the "We create chemistry" strategy, see page 22 onward

We expect competitors from emerging markets to gain increasing significance in the years ahead. Furthermore, we predict that many raw material suppliers will expand their value chains.
We counter this risk through active portfolio management. We exit markets where risks outweigh opportunities, and in which we see limited possibilities to stand out from our competitors in the long term.
In order to remain competitive, we continuously improve our operational excellence. Our strategic excellence program, DrivE, also contributes to this aim. Starting at the end of 2018, we expect this program to contribute around 1 billion in earnings each year compared with baseline 2015.
In order to achieve lasting profitable growth, tap into new market segments and customers, and make our customers more successful, our research and business focus is on highly innovative business areas, some of which we enter into through strategic cooperative partnerships.
Innovation
The trend toward more sustainability in our customer industries continues. We want to use innovations to take advantage of the resulting opportunities. In the long term, we aim to continue increasing sales and earnings with new and improved products.
BASF's enhanced innovation approach helps the company increase its power of innovation and ensure competitive ability through targeted enhancement and innovative application of specific key technologies. This is achieved by honing the focus of research on topics with long-term strategic business relevance, enhancing existing scientific processes and methods and introducing new ones, and optimizing our organizational structures. The central research areas Process Research & Chemical Engineering, Advanced Materials & Systems Research and Bioscience Research serve as global platforms headquartered in one of the regions particularly significant for us: Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Together with the development units in our operating divisions, they form the core of the global Know-How Verbund. Stronger regional presence opens up new opportunities to participate in local innovation processes and gain access to local talent. We also address the risk of the technical or economic failure of research and development projects by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio, as well as through professional, milestone-based project management.
We optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of our research activities through our global Know-How Verbund as well as through collaboration with partners and customers. Furthermore, we continuously review the chances of success and the underlying conditions of research projects; this

118 Management's Report
Forecast -- Opportunities and risks report 

BASF Report 2016

review includes all phases from idea generation to product launch. The trust of customers and consumers is essential for the successful introduction of new technologies. That is why we enter into dialog with stakeholders at an early stage of development.
For more on innovation, see page 32 onward
Portfolio development through investments
We expect the increase in chemical production in emerging markets in the coming years to remain above the global average. This will create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local presence; therefore, more than a quarter of our investment budget will be spent in emerging markets over the next five years. In North America, investments in new production facilities form the basis of future growth. For example, we are constructing an ammonia production plant in Freeport, Texas, with Yara International ASA (based in Oslo, Norway). In addition, we are continuing to evaluate an investment in a world-scale methane-to-propylene complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast and conduct regular assessments with a view to developments in raw material prices and the relevant market conditions.
Our decisions on the type, size and locations of our investment projects are based on assumptions related to the longterm development of markets, margins and costs, as well as raw material availability and country, currency and technology risks. Opportunities and risks arise from potential deviations in actual developments from our assumptions.
For more on our investment plans, see page 123 onward
Acquisitions
In the future, we will continue to refine our portfolio through acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth, are innovation-driven, offer added value for our customers and reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
The evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role during the assessment of acquisition targets. A detailed analysis and quantification are conducted as part of due diligence. Examples of risks include increased staff turnover, delayed realization of synergies, and the assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantifiable in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not fulfilled, risks could arise, such as the need to impair intangible assets; however, there could also be opportunities, for example, from additional synergies.
For more on our acquisitions, see page 37 onward

Recruitment and long-term retention of qualified employees
BASF, too, is adjusting in the medium and long term to the rising challenge of gaining skilled employees due to demographic changes, especially in North America and Europe. As a result, there is an increased risk that job vacancies may not be filled with suitable applicants, or only after a delay. We address these risks through our Best Team Strategy and the global initiatives derived from it, covering demographic and knowledge management, Diversity + Inclusion, employee and leadership development, intensified employer branding, and supplementary regional initiatives. With these measures, we increase BASF's attractiveness as an employer and retain our employees in the long term.
For more on the individual initiatives and our goals, see page 40 onward
Sustainability
BASF uses sustainability management tools to identify upcoming opportunities and risks that arise in connection with the topics of environment, society and governance. Their longterm effect on our business activities and their associated relevance are assessed through such instruments as our materiality analysis, and take into account our experiences from constant stakeholder dialog. We have established global monitoring systems to check adherence to laws and our voluntary commitments in the areas of environment, society and governance. These also incorporate our suppliers.
In terms of upcoming opportunities and risks, material aspects identified included: energy and climate, water, resources and ecosystems, responsible production, and employm ent and employability. In addition to specific requirements for these aspects, discussion is growing surrounding the internalization of external effects.
In order to identify, assess and direct climate-related risks and opportunities, our risk management process includes a nalyzing the material aspect "energy and climate." For BASF as an energy-intensive company, opportunities and risks arise particularly from regulatory changes, such as in carbon prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation.

Forecast -- Economic environment in 2017

Economic environment in 2017

The global economy will presumably grow by 2.3% in 2017, about as fast as in 2016 (+2.3%). In light of significant political uncertainty, volatility is likely to remain high. We forecast a considerable slowdown in growth in the European Union. For the United States, we currently a nticipate a slight upturn in growth. Growth in China is likely to continue its downward trend. We expect the recession in Brazil and Russia to end. We assume that global chemical production will grow by 3.4% in 2017, comparable with the rate of 2016. For 2017, we predict an average price of $55 per barrel for Brent blend crude oil and an exchange rate of $1.05 per euro.

Economic growth in the European Union is expected to slow down considerably in 2017. In the United Kingdom, uncer tainty as to the terms of exit from the European Union is likely to curb investment and private consumption. This weaker dynam ic will have a dampening effect on the growth of Britain's E.U. trading partners, including Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Growth will presumably remain at a stable higher level in the eastern E.U. countries. We expect the recession in Russia to end, supported by our forecast of a slight recovery in the oil price.
Following the administration change in the United States, economic prospects for the United States are especially difficult to predict. We assume that this uncertainty will be reflected in a greater reluctance to invest in the manufacturing and service sectors. Nevertheless, overall economic growth in 2017 will quicken somewhat, as investments in the oil and gas industry are unlikely to continue declining. While the tax cuts planned by the new U.S. administration could have positive effects on growth, the expected protectionist measures and the stronger U.S. dollar pose risks to the country's economy.

In the emerging markets of Asia, we expect growth to continue weakening in 2017. Against the backdrop of economic restructuring in China, we anticipate a further cooldown in economic momentum. We predict growth at levels comparable to 2016 for the other countries in the region. While developments in China will probably exercise a dampening effect, raw material prices and demand for imports from South America and Russia should stabilize. The region's economy is supported by a solidly growing IT and communications industry.
Japan's gross domestic product is expected to maintain its merely minimal upward trend in 2017. Monetary and fiscal policy will continue to provide some growth impetus; however, investment momentum and private consumption will remain on the slow side in an environment of weak domestic demand. Moreover, we do not expect any significant impulses that would boost exports.
We anticipate an end to the economic downturn in South America. Leading indicators suggest that Brazil has bottomed out. Falling interest rates and declining inflation could increasingly support readiness to invest in the country; export demand is also likely to rise. We forecast economic recovery in Argentina. Decreasing inflation, a stable exchange rate and a better investment climate should provide impetus for growth.

Forecast -- Economic environment in 2017 

BASF Report 2016

Outlook for key customer industries
 Marginally higher growth expected in global industrial production for 2017
Global industrial production in 2017 is likely to grow marginally faster than in 2016, at 2.3%. This will be largely attributable to the end of the severe recession in South America, where industrial production should once again show slight growth. In the emerging markets of Asia, growth in industrial production will abate slightly, from 5.5% to 5.2%. In the advanced economies, it will probably remain weak, at under one percent.
We expect an economic slowdown in the transportation sector overall compared with 2016. After three years of solid growth, automotive production is likely to expand only slowly in western Europe, while other branches of the transportation industry could increase their growth rates. A turnaround can be expected in the Russian automotive market. The eastern European automotive market will begin growing again slightly as a result, even if at a low level. In North America, we expect production to stagnate overall. U.S. automotive production will probably shrink slightly; in Mexico, on the other hand, new production-line startups are expected to lead to growth. In South America, we anticipate slight increases in production once again for 2017. Growth in automotive production in China will weaken after the significant gains seen in 2016.
In the energy and raw materials sector, production will presumably grow again in 2017 after stagnating in 2016. However, in Europe and South America, we only anticipate a slight increase in production volumes. Higher raw material prices and the return of stronger demand are likely to provide somewhat faster growth in North America. Production will expand only moderately in the emerging markets of Asia; this will be partly offset by rising imports from Australia.
For the construction sector, we are assuming that the solid growth rates will continue overall. Construction volumes will grow only moderately in western Europe. A sharp increase in Germany and weak growth in France and Italy will contrast with a shrinking market in the United Kingdom. In the eastern E.U. countries, construction activity will recover somewhat after the strong declines of the previous year. However, we still see no increase in activity in Russia. Construction in North America is expected to grow at a moderate pace. We do not anticipate growth impetus in the infrastructure sector in the

short term; financing conditions and the volume of a potential, state-funded infrastructure program remain unclear. In China, we continue to expect support measures for the construction industry; growth there will nevertheless abate. We still expect the other Asian emerging markets to show stable growth rates in the construction industry. In Japan, government spending programs should ensure additional investments in infrastructure. The construction market in South America is likely to recover somewhat after the declines of recent years. Given a background of continuing weak oil prices, only a slight recovery in construction activity is expected in the Middle East.
Consumer goods production will presumably grow s lightly faster in 2017 than in the previous year. The increase will remain weak in western Europe; eastern Europe will see h igher rates, albeit somewhat lower than in 2016. After a slight decline in the previous year, we once again expect modest growth in North America. In Asia, which accounts for over half of the world's production of consumer goods, growth will probably remain stable at a high level. For South America, we predict consumer goods output will stagnate following last year's considerable decline.
The electronics industry is likely to expand its production at a similarly strong rate as in 2016. We anticipate stable growth in Asia, the center of the global electronics industry, at a level comparable to that of the previous year. The increase will probably be somewhat higher year-on-year in North America.
In the health and nutrition sector, growth should once again match the levels of recent years. We expect the increase to be slightly higher overall in the European Union and in North America. The fast pace of growth in this sector in Asia will probably let up slightly in 2017. In this industry, too, we expect production to recover in South America.
We expect stable to slightly accelerating growth in agricultural production in 2017, given the low level of agric ultural production growth in 2016. Record yields in some regions ­ of corn and soy in North America and wheat in eastern Europe, for example ­ contrasted with declining yields in parts of South A merica and Asia in particular, due to the negative e ffects of El Niño as well as weaker monsoon rains. Global demand for bioethanol in 2017 will remain dampened by lower prices in the energy sector. Against this backdrop, we expect prices for agricultural raw materials to remain under pressure in 2017.

Forecast -- Economic environment in 2017

Outlook for the chemical industry
 Global growth in chemical industry at level of previous year
Global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will probably grow by 3.4% in 2017, the same pace as 2016 (+3.4%). We anticipate a marginally higher expansion rate in the advanced economies (2016: +0.9%, 2017: +1.1%). Growth in the emerging markets will presumably weaken somewhat (2016: +5.4%, 2017: +5.1%). The global growth rate of the chemical market will be largely determined by developm ents in China, which accounts for more than a third of worldwide production. There, the upward trend may con tinue to slacken but producers in China are nevertheless likely to contribute more than two percentage points to worldwide chemical industry growth. Yet macroeconomic risks in China remain high, therefore, our forecast for global chemical growth is marked by particular uncertainty.
Chemical production in the European Union is expected to barely grow faster than in 2016. In general, the increase in production will remain modest against the backdrop of a sluggish domestic market. We expect competitive pressure on export markets to remain intense, even though the naphtha- based European chemical industry benefits more from low oil prices than the gas-based production in the United States.
In the United States, we expect somewhat faster growth in chemical production, at just under 2%, as new production capacity, which will also be used for export, comes onstream.

Overall chemical growth is likely to decelerate somewhat in the emerging markets of Asia, mainly due to the slowdown in China, which will also affect the other developing countries in the region.
In Japan, we presume a weak overall economic environment and minimal growth in chemical production.
In South America, the anticipated end of the recession in Argentina and Brazil will result in slight growth in chemical production in the region.

BASF Report 2016

Outlook 2017

For 2017, we expect the global economy and chemical production to grow at around the same pace as 2016. We assume an average price of $55 for a barrel of Brent blend crude oil and an exchange rate of $1.05 per euro. In an environment that remains volatile, we aim to grow profitably and considerably raise the BASF Group's sales. For income from operations (EBIT) before special items as well as for EBIT, we anticipate a slight increase compared with the previous year.1
For more information on our expectations for the economic environment in 2017, see page 119 onward
Sales and earnings forecast for the BASF Group
 Considerable sales growth through increases in all segments
 Slightly higher EBIT before special items
We expect BASF Group sales to grow considerably in the 2017 business year. This will be supported by slightly higher sales in the Performance Products segment and by considerable increases in the other segments as well as in Other.
We want to slightly raise EBIT before special items compared with 2016. We anticipate considerably higher contributions from the Oil & Gas segment and from Other. In the Performance Products, Functional Materials & Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments, we assume EBIT before special items will be slightly higher, while the contribution from the Chemicals segment will match the prior-year level.
BASF Group EBIT is also expected to grow slightly in 2017. A significantly higher contribution from the Oil & Gas segment and slight increases in the Chemicals, Performance Products and Agricultural Solutions segments are expected to more than offset the slight declines in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment and in Other. In 2016, EBIT of the Functional Materials & Solutions segment contained special income from divestitures, and EBIT of Other included special income from the sale of assets.
We are likely to once again earn a significant premium on our cost of capital in 2017; compared with the previous year, however, BASF Group EBIT after cost of capital will decrease considerably. The slight rise in EBIT ­ despite a lower level of special income from divestitures ­ will be contrasted by higher cost of capital, due for the most part to the acquisition of Chemetall at the end of 2016 as well as the startup of new plants. In the Functional Materials & Solutions segment, we are therefore assuming that EBIT after cost of capital will d ecline considerably. We aim to boost it slightly in the Chemicals segment and considerably in the other segments.
The significant risks and opportunities that could affect our forecast are described on pages 111 to 118.

Sales and earnings forecast for the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment are likely to grow considerably in 2017. We anticipate higher sales prices as a consequence of rising raw material prices, as well as volumes growth from factors such as the startup of new plants. We assume that strong competitive pressure will continue, especially on the markets for butanediol, isocyanates and caprolactam. EBIT before special items is likely to match the level of 2016. We expect the earnings contribution from the increase in sales volumes to offset both margin pressure and higher fixed costs. Fixed costs will rise especially in the Intermediates division, mainly as a result of scheduled plant turnarounds and initial expenditures for the new acetylene plant in Ludwigshafen.
In the Performance Products segment, we expect the market environment to remain challenging, but nevertheless aim to slightly increase sales in 2017. This will be largely supported by volumes growth in all divisions, thanks in part to higher plant capacity utilization rates as well as the startup of new production capacities. We anticipate higher fixed costs in 2017, especially from new plant startups. This rise will be more than offset by strict cost discipline and measures to increase competitiveness in all divisions. As a result, we forecast slightly higher EBIT before special items compared with 2016.
We want to achieve a considerable sales increase in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment in 2017. The Chemetall business acquired from Albemarle will contribute to this, as will the sales volumes growth anticipated in all divisions. Our forecast is supported by the expectation of continuing good demand from the automotive and construction industries. The divestitures completed in 2016 in the Catalysts and Coatings divisions, along with a probable decline in precious metal prices, will slow sales growth. As a result of higher sales, EBIT before special items is likely to slightly exceed the level of 2016.
For the Agricultural Solutions segment, we anticipate stable market development for crop protection products in 2017. Our goal is to utilize growth potential on the market primarily through the launch of innovative products, growth in the emerging markets ­ especially Asia ­ and a strong customer focus. We are planning to increase volumes in 2017 and considerably boost sales levels. Because of ongoing margin pressure in a market environment that remains challenging, we assume a slight increase in EBIT before special items.

1 With reference to sales, "slight" represents a change of 1­5%, while "considerable" applies to changes of 6% and higher. "At prior-year level" indicates no change (+/­0%). For earnings, "slight" means a change of 1­10%, while "considerable" is used for changes of 11% and higher. "At prior-year level" indicates no change (+/­0 %).

2 Effective January 1, 2017, the Chemicals and Performance Products segments' activities for the electronics industry were merged and allocated to the Performance Products segment as the Electronic Materials global business unit. To facilitate comparability, the 2016 figures for both segments have been adjusted accordingly.

Our planning for the 2017 business year in the Oil & Gas segment is based on an average price for Brent blend crude oil of $55 per barrel. Gas prices in northwestern Europe are likely to hover above the level of 2016. We anticipate a considerable rise in sales and EBIT before special items. Higher prices for oil and gas and a contribution from our share in the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field exceeding that of the previous year will substantially support this development. In 2016, the e xcess amounts received over previous years were compensated as contractually agreed with our partner, G azprom.
Sales in Other are expected to considerably increase in 2017, primarily as a result of higher prices in raw material trading. We also anticipate a considerable rise in EBIT before special items as compared with 2016.

Investments3
 Investments of around 3.9 billion planned for 2017
Our investments in 2016 focused on the Chemicals, Performance Products and Oil & Gas segments. For example, we started up further sections of the TDI production complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany; completed construction of the aroma ingredients complex in Kuantan, Malaysia; and invested in field development projects in Argentina, Norway and Russia.
For 2017, we are planning total capital expenditures of around 3.9 billion for the BASF Group. We have planned capital expenditures totaling 19.0 billion for the period from 2017 to 2021 and will invest more than a quarter of this amount in emerging markets. The average investment volume in the years ahead will therefore remain at the same level as in 2016. Projects currently being planned or underway include:

Capital expenditures: Selected projects

Location Caojing, China Geismar, Louisiana Ludwigshafen, Germany

Project Construction: automotive coatings plant Capacity expansion: MDI Replacement: acetylene plant Construction: vitamin A production plant

In the Oil & Gas segment, our currently planned investments of around 4.4 billion between 2017 and 2021 will focus mainly on the development of proven gas and oil deposits in Argen tina, Norway and Russia. The actual amount of expenditure is also dependent on oil and gas price developments and will be adjusted as necessary.

Exercise rights of co-administration and supervision at
A nnual Shareholders' Meeting

Corporate governance refers to the entire system for managing and supervising a company. This includes its organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance guarantees that BASF is directed and monitored in a responsible manner focused on value creation. It fosters the confidence of our domestic and international investors, the financial markets, our customers and other business partners, employees, and the public in BASF.
The fundamental elements of BASF SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier system, with a transparent and effective separation of company management and supervision between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board; the equal representation of shareholders and employees on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
Direction and management by the Board of Executive Directors
 Board of Executive Directors strictly separated from the Supervisory Board
 Responsible for company management  Sets corporate goals and strategic direction
The Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the m anagement of the company, and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third parties. BASF's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the activity of the Board of Executive Directors and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously be a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors agrees on the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas; determines the company's internal organization; and decides on the composition of management on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and m anagement capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.

The Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value. Among the Board's responsibilities is the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements of BASF SE. Furthermore, it must ensure that the company's activities comply with the law and with internal corporate directives. This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management.
Decisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made at regularly held Board meetings called by the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are generally based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the casting vote is given by the Chairman of the Board. However, the Chairman of the Board does not have the right to veto the decisions of the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their assigned areas of responsibility.
The Board can set up Board Committees to consult and decide on individual issues; these must include at least three members of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of important decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures, investments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board that carefully assess the planned measure and evaluate the associated opportunities and risks, and based on this information, report and make recommendations to the Board ­ independently of the affected business area.
The Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk situation, risk management and compliance. Furthermore, the Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company's strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board.

The Statutes of BASF SE define certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to obtain the Super visory Board's approval prior to their conclusion. Such cases include the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue of bonds or comparable financial instruments. However, this is only necessary if the acquisition or disposal price or the amount of the issue in an indiv idual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the last approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.
For more on risk management, see the Forecast from page 111 onward The members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas of responsibility and memberships on the supervisory bodies of other companies, are listed on page 136. Compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is described in detail in the Compensation Report from page 138 onward
Supervision of company management by the Supervisory Board
 Supervisory Board appoints, monitors and advises Board of Executive Directors
 Four Supervisory Board committees
The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors and supervises and advises the Board on management issues. As members of the Supervisory Board cannot simultaneously be on the Board of Executive Directors, a high level of autonomy is already structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.
In addition to the SE Council Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is provided by the Statutes of BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement), which also includes the regulations applicable to BASF for implementing the gender

quota for the Supervisory Board mandated by law as of January 1, 2016. The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF as a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE).
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises twelve members. Six members are elected to a five-year term each by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The remaining six members are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (BASF Works Council Europe), the European employee representation body of the BASF Group.
The meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees are called by their chairmen and, independently, at the request of one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a simple majority vote of the participating members. In the event of a tie, the vote of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder representative, shall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Execu tive Directors by the Supervisory Board. Resolutions can, as needed, also be made in writing or through other means of communication outside of the meetings, as long as no member objects to this form of passing a resolution.
BASF SE's Supervisory Board has established a total of four Supervisory Board Committees: the Personnel Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Strategy Committee.

BASF Report 2016

Objectives for Supervisory Board composition
 Composition criteria: professional and personal qualifications, diversity, and independence
One important concern of good corporate governance is to ensure that seats on the responsible corporate bodies, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, are appropriately filled. Seats on the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE should be filled with members who ensure a well-balanced consideration of all the knowledge, skills and personal qualifications necessary to manage and supervise BASF as a large, globally operating, capital market-oriented company in the chemical industry.
On October 21, 2010, the Supervisory Board agreed upon objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate G overnance Code; these were supplemented in the Super visory Board meetings of December 20, 2012, and October 22, 2015. According to these objectives, the Supervisory Board shall be composed in such a way that the members as a group possess knowledge, ability and expert experience in the following: ­­The management of an internationally operating company ­­Cross-industry value creation along different value chains ­­The application of accounting principles and internal control
procedures ­­The field of technical and scientific innovations in the chemi-
cal sector and associated industries as well as in the sectors using chemical products.
At least one independent member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the fields of accounting or auditing as per Section 100(5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). With regard to diversity, the Supervisory Board shall consider a variety of professional and international experience as well as the participation of women. Individuals who may have a conflict of interest shall not be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. The same applies to candidates who will have reached the age of 70 by the day of the election. Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally not exceed 15 years; this corresponds to three regular statutory periods in office. The members of the Supervisory Board elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting already fulfill this target ­ in effect since October 2015 ­ with one exception.
With regard to independence, the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that all Supervisory Board members are independent as defined by the terms of the Code. In assessing independence, the Supervisory Board assumes that neither election as an employee representative, nor membership on the Board of Executive Directors more than two years in the past, nor the duration of membership on the Supervisory Board, taken in isolation, precludes the classification as independent.

On this basis, the Supervisory Board has determined that all of its current members can be considered independent. We firmly believe that the current composition fulfills the objectives with the aforementioned exception regarding the period of membership.
Commitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF SE
 Minimum quota on Supervisory Board, target figures for Board of Executive Directors and top management
On April 24, 2015, the Law on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public Sector came into force in Germany.
The supervisory board of a publicly listed European society (SE) that is composed of the same number of shareholder and employee representatives must, according to Section 17(2) of the SE Implementation Act, consist of at least 30% each of women and men. The Supervisory Board of BASF SE currently comprises three women and nine men. Two of the six shareholder representatives elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting are women. According to the legal stipulations of Section 17(2) SE Implementation Act, the minimum quota is not to be fulfilled immediately but rather upon any necessary reappointments, that is, new elections. In 2016, the employee- elected Supervisory Board member Wolfgang Daniel left the Supervisory Board. He is succeeded by Waldemar Helber, who joined the Supervisory Board without additional appointment, that is, without election, as the member personally chosen to replace Wolfgang Daniel as early as 2013 until the end of the 2019 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. In accordance with legal regulations, the legal minimum quota will therefore be reached after the next regular Supervisory Board election in 2019 at the latest.
As a target figure for the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board determined, in accordance with Section 111(5) AktG for the first target-attainment period after the law's entry into force, that the Board of Executive Directors should have at least one female member. With eight members of the Board of Executive Directors, this represents 12.5%. Both at the time the target was set, and by the target-attainment deadline on December 31, 2016, the Board of Executive Directors contained one woman. The stipulation was therefore met.
In addition, the Board of Executive Directors decided on target figures for the percentage of women in the two management levels below the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE as per the legal requirements in Section 76(4) AktG: These were at 9.4% for the leadership level directly below the Board, and 11.8% for the level below that. This corresponded to the status at the time these target figures were determined.

BASF Report 2016 

Corporate Governance 131
Corporate governance report

On December 31, 2016, the deadline for attainment of these goals, the percentage of women in the first level of management under the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE was at 12.1%. The percentage of women in management one level below that was 7.3%.
We do not regard these deviations as meaningful, as BASF views the further development and promotion of women as a global duty independent of individual Group companies. We set ourselves ambitious goals for this and made further progress in 2016. The focus goes beyond gender quotas, and includes, for example, increasing international representation.
BASF will continue working on expanding the percentage of women in its leadership team. The company is carrying out, and constantly enhancing, worldwide measures to this effect.
By the end of the first target-attainment period, new target figures were set for BASF SE: The Supervisory Board determined as a target figure for the Board of Executive Directors that the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE should continue to have at least one female member. With eight current members of the Board of Executive Directors, this represents a proportion of 12.5%. The Board of Executive Directors also decided on target figures for the proportion of women in the two management levels below the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE: Women are to make up 12.1% of the leadership level directly below the Board, and the level below that is to comprise 7.3% women. This corresponds to the status at the time these target figures were determined. The deadline for achieving these new goals was set for December 31, 2021.
The November 2015 Employee Participation Agreement relevant to the composition of the Supervisory Board is available at basf.com/en/governance For more on women in executive positions in the BASF Group worldwide, see page 26 For more on the inclusion of diversity, including promotion of women, see the chapter on Working at BASF in the Management's Report on page 43
Shareholders' rights
 Shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting
 One share, one vote
Shareholders exercise their rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which usually takes place within the first five months of the business year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects half of the members of the Supervisory Board and, in particular, decides on the formal discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, the distribution of profits, capital measures, the authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and the selection of the auditor.
Each BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE's shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves entered with their shares into the company share register and to provide the information necessary for registration in the share register according to the German Stock Corporation Act. There are no registration restrictions and there is

no limit to the number of shares that can be registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed shareholders may e xercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting either personally, through a representative of their choice or through a company-appointed proxy authorized by the shareholders to vote according to their instructions. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully implemented the principle of "one share, one vote."
All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, to have their say concerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to contest resolutions of the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court.
Shareholders who hold at least 500,000 of the company's share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code
 BASF SE follows all recommendations of German Corporate Governance Code
BASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company.
BASF SE follows all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its most recently revised version of May 2015. In the same manner, BASF has followed nearly all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code. We have not implemented the suggestion to enable shareholders to follow the proceedings of the entire Annual Shareholders' Meeting online. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting is publicly accessible via online broadcast until the end of the speech by the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors. The subsequent discussion of items on the agenda is not accessible online in order to preserve the character of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as a meeting attended by our shareholders on-site.
The joint Declaration of Conformity 2016 by the Board of Executive D irectors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE is rendered on page 150 For more on the Declaration of Conformity 2016, the implementation of the Code's suggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/governance

BASF Report 2016

Disclosure according to Section 315(4) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the e xplanatory report of the Board of Executive D irectors according to Section 176(1) Sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)
As of December 31, 2016, the subscribed capital of BASF SE was 1,175,652,728.32 divided into 918,478,694 registered shares with no par value. Each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes, shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates. There are neither different classes of shares nor shares with preferential voting rights (golden shares).
The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article 39 of the SE Council Regulation, Section 16 of the SE Implementation Act and Sections 84, 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the BASF SE Statutes. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors, and can nominate a chairperson, as well as one or more vice chairpersons. The members of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years, and reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and dismissals according to its own best judgment.
According to Article 59(1) SE Council Regulation, amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted with at least a twothirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to the Statutes, the Section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve upon amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the redemption of repurchased BASF shares and after a new issue of shares from the authorized capital.
Until May 1, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE is empowered by a resolution passed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 2, 2014, to increase the subscribed capital ­ with the approval of the Supervisory Board ­ by a total amount of 500 million through the issue of new shares against cash or contributions in kind (authorized capital). A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to

shareholders. This can also be done by a credit institution acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer these to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 20% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Section 5(8) of the BASF SE Statutes. This applies in particular if, for capital increases in return for cash contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of shares issued under this authorization is not more than 10% of the stock of shares on the date of issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or shares in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF shares.
At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 27, 2012, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the shares existing at the time of the resolution (10% of the company's share capital) until April 26, 2017. At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the purchase can take place on the stock exchange or by way of a public purchase offer directed to all shareholders. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased company shares (a) through a stock exchange, (b) through a public offer directed to all shareholders and ­ with the approval of the Supervisory Board ­ to third parties, (c) for a cash payment that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price at the time of sale and (d) for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or shares in companies or in connection with mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders' subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to redeem the shares bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the redeemed shares.
Bonds issued by BASF SE grant the bearer the right to request early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if one person ­ or several persons acting in concert ­ hold or acquire a BASF SE share volume after the time of issuance which corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of control), and one of the rating agencies named in the bond's terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF SE or the bond, or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120 days after the change-of-control event.
In the event of a change of control, members of the Board of Executive Directors shall, under certain additional conditions, receive compensation (details of which are listed in the Compensation Report on page 144). A change of control is assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25% or the increase of such a holding. In addition, employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classed as senior executives will receive a severance payment if their contract of employment is terminated by BASF within 18 months of the occurrence of a change of control, provided the employee has not given cause for the termination. The employee whose service contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of

1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on the number of months that have passed since the change-ofcontrol event.
The remaining specifications stipulated in Section 315(4) HGB refer to situations that are not applicable to BASF SE.
For more on bonds issued by BASF SE, see basf.com/en/investor/bonds
Directors' and Officers' liability insurance
BASF SE has taken out liability insurance that covers the a ctivities of members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board (D&O insurance). This policy provides for the level of deductibles for the Board of Executive Directors as prescribed by Section 93(2)(3) AktG and for the level of deductibles for the Supervisory Board as recommended in Section 3.8(3) of the German Corporate Governance Code.
Share ownership by Members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board
No member of the Board of Executive Directors or the Supervisory Board owns shares in BASF SE and related options or other derivatives that account for 1% or more of the share capital. Furthermore, the total volume of BASF SE shares and related financial instruments held by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board accounts for less than 1% of the shares issued by the company.
Share dealings of the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board (obligatory reportable and publishable directors' dealings under Article 19(1) of the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 (MAR))
As legally stipulated by Article 19(1) MAR, all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board as well as certain members of their families are required to disclose the purchase or sale of financial instruments of BASF SE (e.g., shares, bonds, options, forward contracts, swaps) to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für F inanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and to the company if transactions within the calendar year exceed the threshold of 5,000.
In 2016, a total of four purchases by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board and members of their families subject to disclosure were reported as Directors' Dealings, involving between 417 and 2,660 BASF shares. The price per share was between 62.43 and 67.88. The volume of the individual trades was between 26,033.31 und 180,567.16. The disclosed share transactions are published on the website of BASF SE.
For more on securities transactions reported in 2016, see basf.com/en/governance/sharedealings

Information on the auditor
The Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 29, 2016, once again elected KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the auditor of the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements and Separate Financial Statements of BASF SE for the 2016 business year, as well as for those reports' corresponding Management's Reports. KPMG member firms also audit the majority of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. KPMG has been the continuous auditor of BASF SE since the 2006 Financial Statements; the 2015 Financ ial Statements marked the tenth annual report in a row audited by KPMG. For this reason, a public call to tender was made to all auditors for the audit of the 2016 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, in line with the E.U. Regulation 537/2014 of April 16, 2014. Based on the results of the tendering process, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that it once again propose KPMG for election. After completing the tendering process, KPMG can now be proposed for election at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as BASF's auditor without further tendering processes up to and including the 2024 business year. Hans-Dieter Krauß has been the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements since auditing the 2010 Financial Statements. Since the 2013 Financial Statements, the auditor responsible for the separate financial statements has been Alexander Bock.
The total fee paid to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and other BASF Group companies for non-audit services, in addition to the auditing fee, was 1 million in 2016. This represents around 5.7% of the fees for auditing the financial statements.

Participants in compliance training

63 audits
Conducted internally on compliance

Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure a dherence to legal regulations and the company's internal guidelines. This topic has been integrated into our "We create chemistry" strategy. Our employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards into day-to-day business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these principles.
Compliance Program and Code of Conduct
 Compliance standards integrated into corporate values
 Regular compliance training for employees
Based on international standards, BASF's Compliance Program combines important laws and company-internal policies ­ themselves exceeding legal requirements ­ with external voluntary commitments to create a framework that regulates how all BASF employees interact with business partners, officials, colleagues and society. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct received by every employee. All employees and managers are obligated to adhere to its guidelines, which describe our principles for proper conduct and cover topics ranging from corruption and

antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.
Abiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible leadership. This has been expressly embedded in our values, where we state: "We strictly adhere to our compliance standards." We are convinced that compliance with these standards will not only prevent the disadvantages associated with violations, such as penalties and fines; we also view compliance as the right path toward securing our company's longterm success.
Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset. To this end, all employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic compliance training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations. Training takes place in different formats, including face-to-face training, e-learning or workshops. The course materials and formats are constantly being updated. In total, more than 25,000 participants worldwide received around 40,000 hours of compliance training in 2016.

Compliance

Compliance culture at BASF
We firmly believe that for corporate responsibility to be a s uccess, there must be an active culture of living these guidelines within the company. This culture takes years to develop, and requires the consistent, reliable application of compliance standards. Because we introduced our Code of Conduct early on, these standards have already been firmly established and are undisputed. In our last Global Employee Survey, conducted in 2015, the vast majority of our employees confirmed that their work environment places high value on proper conduct in alignment with internal company guidelines and standards. Starting in 2015, we have now investigated all cases in which the answer to the corresponding question showed unitspecific anomalies, and held, for instance, additional seminars or workshops as necessary.
Monitoring adherence to our Compliance principles
 Central role of Chief Compliance Officer and compliance officers
 56 external hotlines worldwide  Numerous internal Compliance audits
BASF's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the Board of Executive Directors and manages the implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported by 104 compliance officers worldwide. The CCO regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on progress in the program's implementation as well as on any significant findings. Furthermore, the CCO reports to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance Program as well as any major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors.
We particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly seek guidance if in doubt. For this, they can consult not only their managers but also dedicated specialist departments and company compliance officers. We have also set up 56 external hotlines worldwide which our employees can turn to anonymously. We make sure that all concerns are processed and answered in a swift manner.
In 2016, 278 calls and emails were received by our external hotlines (2015: 357). Concerns involved questions ranging from personnel management and handling of company property to information on the behavior of business partners or human rights issues ­ such as labor and social standards. We continued to observe increasing awareness when it came to potential conflicts of interest. We launched case-specific investigations, in accordance with applicable law and internal

regulations, into all cases of suspected misconduct that we became aware of. Confirmed violations were penalized, up to and including dismissal. This involved making sure that the necessary action was taken in accordance with standardized company criteria.
BASF's Corporate Audit department monitors adherence to compliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance violations could occur. They check that employees u phold regulations and make sure that the established processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential risk or preclude violations in the first place. In 2016, 63 Group-wide audits of this kind were performed (2015: 92). The audits confirmed the effectiveness of the compliance management system. No irregularities were shown in the audit's focus areas of antitrust and trade controls and embargo, nor was there a major need for action identified beyond these topics.
Based on the Guideline on Business Partner Due Diligence introduced in 2015, we monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance risks. This is done by means of a checklist, a questionnaire distributed to business partners, and an internet-based analysis. The results are then documented. Depending on the results, conclusions are drawn regarding whether and how to maintain the business relationship. We furthermore expect all suppliers to know of and act in accordance with our global Code of Conduct.
We support the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal guidelines and processes in keeping with these principles. For example, we introduced a new internal guideline to respect international labor and social standards. Outside of our company, as well, we support respect for human rights and the fight against corruption: We are, for example, a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency International Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the implementation of these organizations' objectives.

Compensation report 
Compensation report

BASF Report 2016

This report outlines the main principles of the compensation for the Board of Executive Directors and discloses the amount and structure of the compensation of each Board member. Furthermore, it provides information on end-ofservice undertakings with respect to Board members, as well as information on the compensation of Supervisory Board members.
Compensation of the Board of Executive Directors
This report meets the disclosure requirements of the Germ an Commercial Code, supplemented by the additional requirements based on the German Act on Disclosure of Management Board Remuneration (VorstandsvergütungsOffenlegungsgesetz) as well as the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung), and is aligned with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in its version of May 5, 2015.
Based on a proposal by the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the amount and structure of compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors.
The amount and structure of compensation is determined by the company's size, complexity and financial position, as well as the performance of the Board of Executive Directors. Internal and external appropriateness of the Board's compensation is reviewed by external auditors on a regular basis. Globally operating companies based in Europe serve as an external reference. For internal comparison, compensation is considered in total as well as over time, especially for senior executives.
For more on the Supervisory Board and its committees, see page 137 and from page 147 onward
Principles
The compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is designed to promote sustainable corporate development. It is marked by a pronounced variability in relation to the performance of the Board of Executive Directors and BASF Group's return on assets.
The compensation of the Board of Executive Directors comprises:
1. Fixed salary 2. Annual variable compensation 3. Share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program 4. Nonmonetary compensation and other additional compen-
sation 5. Company pension benefits

The compensation components are shown in detail below:
1. The fixed salary is a set amount of yearly compensation paid out in even installments. It is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board and adjusted, if necessary.
2. The actual annual variable compensation (variable bonus) is based on the performance of the entire Board of Executive Directors and the return on assets. The return on assets is also used to determine the variable compensation of all other employee groups.
In order to assess the sustainable performance of the Board of Executive Directors, each year the Supervisory Board sets a target agreement with the entire Board of Executive Directors that primarily contains medium and long-term goals.
The Supervisory Board assesses the goal achievement of the current year and the previous two years. A performance factor with a value between 0 and 1.5 is determined on the basis of the goal achievement ascertained by the Supervisory Board. The variable bonus for the prior fiscal year is payable after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
Board members, like other employee groups, may contribute a portion of their annual variable bonus into a deferred compensation program. For members of the Board of Executive Directors, as well as for all other senior executives of the BASF Group in Germany, the maximum amount that can be contributed to this program is 30,000. Board members have taken advantage of this offer to varying degrees.
3. A share-price-based, long-term incentive (LTI) program exists for members of the Board of Executive Directors. It is also offered to all other senior executives of BASF Group. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are subject to a stricter set of rules than are contained in the general program conditions: They are required to participate in the program with at least 10% of their variable bonus. This mandatory investment consisting of BASF shares is subject to a holding period of four years. For any additional voluntary investment of up to 20% of the variable bonus, the general holding period of two years applies. Members of the Board of Executive Directors may only exercise their options at least four years after they have been granted (vesting period). This compensation component is limited, too, by the structure of the LTI program as well as by the upper limit on the options' exercise value. Due to the multiple-year exercise period, it can occur that exercise gains from several LTI program years accumulate inside of one year; there can also be years without any exercise gains.
For more on share ownership by members of the Board of Executive Directors, see page 133 For more on the LTI program, see page 45 and from page 216 onward

Compensation report

4. Included in nonmonetary compensation and other additional compensation (fringe benefits) are the following: delegation allowances, accident insurance premiums and other similar benefits, and benefits from security measures provided by the company. The members of the Board did not receive loans or advances from the company in 2016.
The members of the Board are covered by a directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) concluded by the company, which includes a deductible.
For more on the D&O insurance of the Board of Executive Directors, see page 133
5. As part of the pension benefits granted to the Board of Executive Directors (Board Performance Pension), company pension benefits are intended to accrue annual pension units. The method used to determine the amount of the pension benefits generally corresponds to that used for the other senior executives of the BASF Group in Germany. The method is designed such that both the performance of the company and the progression of the individual Board member's career significantly affect the pension entitlement.
The annual pension benefits accruing to Board members in a given reporting year (pension unit) are composed of a fixed and a variable component. The fixed component is calculated by multiplying the annual fixed salary above the Social Security Contribution Ceiling by 32% (contribution factor). The variable component of the pension unit is the result of multiplying the fixed component with a factor that is dependent on the return on assets in the reporting year and the performance factor, which is decisive for the variable bonus. The amount resulting from the fixed and the variable component is converted into a pension unit (lifelong pension) using actuarial factors based on an actuarial interest rate (5%), the probability of death, invalidity and bereavement according to Heubeck Richttafeln, 2005G (modified), and an assumed pension increase (at least 1% per annum).
The sum of the pension units accumulated over the reporting years determines the respective Board member's pension benefit in the event of a claim. This is the amount that is payable upon retirement. Pension benefits take effect at the end of service after completion of the member's 60th year of age, or on account of disability or death. Pension payments are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted by at least 1% each year.

The pension units also include survivor benefits. Upon the death of an active or former member of the Board, the surviving spouse receives a survivor pension amounting to 60% of the Board member's pension entitlement. The orphan pension amounts to 10% for each half-orphan, 33% for an orphan, 25% each for two orphans and 20% each for three or more orphans of the pension entitlement of the deceased (former) Board member. Total survivor benefits may not exceed 75% of the Board member's pension entitlement. If the survivor pensions exceed the upper limit, they will be proportionately reduced.
Board members are members of the BASF Pensionskasse VVaG, as are generally all employees of BASF SE. Contributions and benefits are determined by the Statutes of the BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and the General Conditions of Insurance.
Amount of total compensation
The tables on pages 140 to 143 show the granted and allo cated compensation as well as service cost of each member of the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with Section 4.2.5(3) of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in its version of May 5, 2015.
Compensation granted in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)
The table "Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC" shows: fixed salary, fringe benefits, annual variable target compensation, LTI program measured at fair value at the grant date, and service cost. The individual compensation components are supplemented by individually attainable minimum and maximum compensation.
Furthermore, a reconciliation statement for total compensation to be reported is provided below the table "Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC" due to the disclosures required by Section 314(1)(6a) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in connection with the German Accounting Standard Number 17 (GAS 17).

2 Payment was made partly in local currency abroad based on a theoretical net salary in Germany. 3 Includes payments to cover additional costs of transfers, such as assumption of prevailing local rental fees. 4 At the end of the regular term of the LTI program 2008, exercise gains which were realized in 2012 or 2010 were allocated to Dr. Kurt Bock and Wayne T. Smith in 2016 in accordance
with the special conditions of the U.S. LTI program. 5 At the end of the regular term of the LTI program 2007, exercise gains which were realized in 2009, 2012 or 2013 were allocated to Dr. Kurt Bock, Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel and
Wayne T. Smith in 2015 in accordance with the special conditions of the U.S. LTI program.

Accounting valuation of multiple-year variable compensation (LTI programs)
The options granted resulted in an expense in 2016. This e xpense refers to the total of all options from the LTI programs 2008 to 2016 and is calculated as the difference in the value of the options on December 31, 2016, compared with the value on December 31, 2015, considering the options exercised and granted in 2016. The value of the options is based primarily on the development of the BASF share price and its relative performance compared with the benchmark index specified for the LTI programs 2008 to 2016.
The expenses reported below are purely accounting figures which do not equate with the allocated actual gains should options be exercised. Each member of the Board may decide individually on the timing and scope of the exercise of options

of the LTI programs, while taking into account the terms and conditions of the program.
The expenses for 2016 relating to all options issued were as follows: Dr. Kurt Bock 5,000 thousand (2015: expense of 1,058 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller 4,052 thousand (2015: expense of 788 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel 4,011 thousand (2015: expense of 660 thousand); Sanjeev Gandhi 156 thousand (2015: expense of 17 thousand); M ichael Heinz 2,423 thousand (2015: expense of 517 thousand); Dr. Harald Schwager 4,182 thousand (2015: expense of 642 thousand); Wayne T. Smith 1,872 thousand (2015: expense of 616 thousand); and Margret Suckale 2,613 thousand (2015: expense of 419 thousand).

144 Corporate Governance
Compensation report 

BASF Report 2016

Pension benefits
The values for service cost incurred in 2016 contain service cost for BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and Board Performance Pension. Service cost for the members of the Board of Executive Directors is shown individually in the tables "Compensation granted in accordance with GCGC" and "Compensation allocated in accordance with GCGC."
The present value of pension benefits (defined benefit o bligation) is an accounting figure for the entitlements that the Board members have accumulated in their years of service at BASF. The defined benefit obligations up to and including 2016 were as follows: Dr. Kurt Bock 18,931 thousand (2015: 15,684 thousand); Dr. Martin Brudermüller 15,929 thousand (2015: 13,148 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel 10,968 thousand (2015: 9,068 thousand); Sanjeev Gandhi 2,409 thousand (2015: 1,588 thousand); Michael Heinz 10,229 thousand (2015: 8,226 thousand); Dr. Harald Schwager 11,096 thousand (2015: 9,157 thousand); Wayne T. Smith 3,210 thousand (2015: 2,355 thousand); and Margret Suckale 4,315 thousand (2015: 3,518 thousand).
End-of-service benefits

business year. If the appointment to the Board of Executive Directors is prematurely terminated as the result of a changeof-control event, the payments may not exceed 150% of the severance compensation cap.
Former members of the Board of Executive Directors
Total compensation for previous Board members and their surviving dependents amounted to 15.9 million in 2016 (2015: 12.1 million1). This figure also contains payments that previous Board members have themselves financed through the deferred compensation program and the expense or gain for 2016 relating to options that previous members of the Board still hold from the time of their active service period.
The continuation of the options that have not yet been exercised at the time of retirement, along with the continuation of the associated holding period for individual investment in BASF shares under the conditions of the program, is intended in order to particularly emphasize how sustainability is incorporated into the compensation for the Board members. Pension provisions for previous Board members and their surviving dependents amounted to 150.4 million (2015: 144.7 million2).

In the event that a member of the Board of Executive Directors retires from employment before the age of 60, either because their appointment was not extended or was revoked for an important reason, they are entitled to pension benefits if they have served on the Board for at least ten years or if the time needed to reach legal retirement age is less than ten years. The company is entitled to offset compensation received for any other work done against pension benefits until the legal retirement age is reached.
The following applies to end of service due to a change- of-control event: A change-of-control event, in terms of this provision, occurs when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25%, or the increase of such a holding. If a Board member's appointment is revoked within one year following a change-of-control event, the Board member will receive the contractually agreed payments for the remaining contractual term of office as a one-off payment (fixed salary and annual variable target compensation). The Board member may also receive the fair value of the option rights acquired in connection with the LTI program within a period of three months or may continue to hold the existing rights under the terms of the program. For the determination of the accrued pension benefits from the Board Performance Pension, the time up to the regular expiry of office is taken into consideration.
There is a general limit on severance pay (severance payment cap) for all Board members. Accordingly, payments made to a Board member upon premature termination of their contract, without serious cause, may not exceed the value of two years' compensation, including fringe benefits, nor compensate more than the remaining term of the contract. The severance payment cap is to be calculated on the basis of the total compensation for the past business year and, if appropriate, also the expected total compensation for the current

Compensation of Supervisory Board members
The disclosure of compensation of the Supervisory Board is based on the German Commercial Code and is aligned with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). The compensation of the Supervisory Board is regulated by the Statutes of BASF SE passed by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
Each member of the Supervisory Board receives an annual fixed compensation of 60,000 and a performance-related variable compensation for each full 0.01 by which the earnings per share of the BASF Group, as declared in the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements for the year for which the remuneration is paid, exceeds the minimum earnings per share. For the 2016 business year, minimum earnings per share amounted to 1.75 (2015: 1.70). The performance-related variable remuneration is 800 for each 0.01 of earnings per share up to an earnings per share of 2.50, 600 for each further 0.01 of earnings per share up to an earnings per share of 3.00, and 400 for each 0.01 beyond this.

In 2016, as in 2015, the company paid the Supervisory Board member Prof. Dr. François Diederich a total of

CHF 38,400 (2016: approximately 35,200; 2015: approximately 36,000) for consulting work in the area of chemical research based on a consulting contract approved by the Supervisory Board.
Beyond this, no other Supervisory Board members received any compensation in 2016 for services rendered personally, in particular, the rendering of advisory and agency services.

prospects for the company and its individual business areas with the Board of Executive Directors. It was convinced of the lawfulness, expediency and propriety of the Board of Executive Director's company leadership.
The Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board were in regular contact outside of Supervisory Board meetings, as well. The former promptly informed the latter of current developments and significant issues. The Supervisory Board was always involved at an early stage in decisions of major importance. The Super visory Board passed resolutions on the individual measures that required the approval of the Supervisory Board. In the 2016 business year, this pertained to the authorization of the Chemetall acquisition. With this transaction, BASF has added the surface treatment business area to its Coatings division.

Supervisory Board meetings

The Supervisory Board's work in 2016 was marked by several events and topics that were, in various respects, both weighty and significant ­ such as the explosion at the Ludwigshafen site, changes in the chemical industry due to the announcement of major mergers and acquisitions that impacted BASF's strategic development, and long-term succession planning for the composition of the Board of Executive Directors.
The Supervisory Board faced these challenges with a full sense of responsibility and supported the Board of Executive Directors' activities, especially in coping with the explosion, and advised the Board of Executive Directors in its deliberations on BASF's strategic further development in an evolving industry environment.
Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of Executive Directors
In 2016, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost care. It regularly monitored the management of the Board of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company's strategic development and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, all of the major financial KPIs of the BASF Group and its segments, the economic situation in the main volumes and procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments from original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board tackled fundamental questions of corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research and development. The Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports from the Board of Executive Directors, and also deliberated on

The Supervisory Board held five meetings in the 2016 reporting year. With the exception of one meeting at which one member of the Supervisory Board was absent due to illness, all Supervisory Board members attended all Supervisory Board meetings in 2016. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the employe es prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions.
An individual overview of meeting attendance has been made available on the company website at: basf.com/governance/supervisoryboard/meetings
A significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors' reports on the current business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings growth, as well as on opportunities and risks for business development, the status of important current and planned investment projects, developments on the capital markets, and significant managerial measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors in addition to innovation projects. In its meetings, the Super visory Board additionally discussed the further development of the BASF Group's business activities through acquisitions, divestitures and investment projects. Significant consultation topics included the acquisition of Chemetall with the entrance into the surface treatment business, the divestiture of the industrial coatings business, the sale of the OLED patent portfolio, the acquisition of Henkel's western European building material business for professional users, and the establishment of a joint venture with Avantium for the production of furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from renewable resources.
Important focus points of the Supervisory Board's consultation topics over the entire business year centered on developments in the chemical industry as a result of announced mergers and acquisitions, such as the DOW and DuPont merger; the acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer and of Syngenta by ChemChina; their potential impact on BASF's business and strategic development possibilities, especially in the Agricultural Solutions segment; and current and future courses of action.

BASF Report 2016 

Corporate Governance 147
Report of the Supervisory Board

With respect to regional opportunities and risks, the Supervisory Board was often occupied with political and economic developments in northern Africa and the Middle East as well as the developm ent of local markets there. Possibilities for tapping these markets were discussed.
At its meeting on February 24, 2016, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management's Report and the proposal for the appropriation of profit for the 2015 business year as presented by the Board of Executive Directors. The meeting on April 29, 2016, served to prepare for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
In addition to strategically significant individual measures, the Supervisory Board also addressed BASF's strategy and long-term business prospects in individual business areas and regions. This was the focus of its meeting on July 25/26, 2016, at which the Board of Executive Directors provided a status update on the implementation of the "We create chemistry" strategy. Main consultation topics comprised possibilities and objectives for strategic portfolio development, innovation and technology, the development of the Oil & Gas and Agricultural Solutions segments, the automotive sector as a key customer industry (especially with regard to the development of electromobility), and opportunities and risks in the Asia Pacific region.
In addition, the Supervisory Board addressed future prospects for the main site in Ludwigshafen and the further development of the Engineering & Maintenance function at its meeting on October 25, 2016.
At its meeting on December 15, 2016, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the Board of Executive Directors' operative and financial planning including the investment budget for 2017, and as usual empowered the Board of Execu tive Directors to procure necessary financing in 2017.
Composition and compensation of the Board of Executive Directors
In several meetings in the 2016 business year, the Supervisory Board conferred on, and passed resolutions on, personnel topics in the Board of Executive Directors as well as questions concerning the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors. Based on preparation conducted by the Personnel Committee, it determined the targets for the Board of Executive Directors for the 2016 business year at its meeting on Feb ruary 24, 2016.
At its meeting on December 15, 2016, the Supervisory Board advised on long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors and approved the early conclusion of the term for Dr. Harald Schwager, member of the Board of Executive Directors for many years, in order to allow for structured succession. Dr. Harald Schwager agreed on early discontinuance of his contract without severance pay by the company and will receive the contractually agreed upon interim and pension benefits in accordance with proper expiration of a term on the Board of Executive Directors. Dr. Harald Schwager will therefore depart the Board of Executive Directors together with Margret Suckale at the conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting

on May 12, 2017. At the same Supervisory Board meeting, Saori Dubourg and Dr. Markus Kamieth were a ppointed to the Board of Executive Directors, effective at the end of the 2017 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, each with a first-time term to the end of the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board agreed at its December 15, 2016, meeting on the performance evaluation of the Board of Executive Directors for the 2016 business year as well as ­ based on an appropriateness test conducted by the Personnel Committee ­ an adjustment of the Board of Executive Directors' compensation including an increase in the fixed s alary and a nnual variable target compensation, effective January 1, 2017.
At several meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed the topic of the compensation of the Supervisory Board. The current configuration of the Supervisory Board's compensation, with a fixed salary and a limited variable compensation component based on earnings per share, has existed largely unchanged since 2006. In normal business years, compensation in fact purely comprises a fixed salary, as the maximum amount of the variable compensation is for the most part reached by the high level of earnings per share. This was also the case for compensation for 2016. The Supervisory Board therefore decided to propose to the 2017 Annual Shareholders' Meeting a formal restructuring of the BASF Supervisory Board's compensation to a purely fixed salary, combined with a long-term obligation for the Supervisory Board members to acquire and keep shares ­ in line with the development of the compensation structures of the majority of large publicly traded companies in Germany.
Committees
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE has four committees: 1. the committee for personnel matters of the Board of Executive Directors and the granting of loans in accordance with Section 89(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel Committee); 2. the Audit Committee; 3. the Nomination Committee; and 4. the Strategy Committee. Following each Committee meeting, the chairpersons of the Committees reported in detail about the meetings and the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.
For information on the composition of the committees and the tasks a ssigned them by the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 129
The Personnel Committee met four times during the reporting period. All committee members attended the meetings. At its meeting on February 24, 2016, the Personnel Committee a dvised on the targets for the Board of Executive Directors for the 2016 business year. The meetings on July 25, 2016, and October 25, 2016, focused on development of leadership at the top levels of management below the Board of Executive Directors and succession planning for that Board.
Further consultation topics comprised a review of the appropriateness of the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors, both in terms of amount and configuration of the

148 Corporate Governance
Report of the Supervisory Board 

BASF Report 2016

compensation system, as well as the structure of the compensation of the Supervisory Board. The basis for this was developed and intensively discussed with an independent compensation consultant. The focus of the December 15, 2016, meeting was the discussion of and resolution on the Super visory Board's proposal for new appointments to the Board of Executive Directors, the adjustment of that Board's compensation, and a redesign of the Supervisory Board's compensation. In addition, the Personnel Committee advised on the performance evaluation of the Board of Executive Directors as well as the target figures for the proportion of women in that Board.
The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed in Section 107(3)(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act and in Subsection 5.3.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code in its version of May 5, 2015. The Audit Committee met five times during the reporting period. All committee members attended all meetings. Its core duties were to review BASF SE's Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as to discuss the quarterly and first-half financial reports with the Board of Executive Directors prior to their publication.
At the meeting on February 21, 2017, the auditor reported in detail on its audits of BASF SE's separate and consolidated financial statements for the 2016 business year and discussed the results of its audit with the Audit Committee.
At the meeting on July 25, 2016, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft ­ the auditor elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting ­ was charged with the audit for the 2016 reporting year and auditing fees were agreed upon. The focus areas for the annual audit were discussed and defined together with the auditor. The Audit Committee categorically excluded any service relationships between auditor and BASF Group companies outside of the audit of the annual financial statements, including beyond prevailing legal limitations. These services may only be performed upon approval by the Audit Committee. For certain nonaudit services beyond the scope of the audit of the financial reports, the Audit Committee either granted approval for individual cases or authorized the Board of Executive Directors to engage KPMG AG Wirtschafts prüfungsgesellschaft for such services. The authorization of each service applies for one reporting year and is limited in amount.
Other important activities included advising the Board of Executive Directors on accounting issues and the internal control system. The internal auditing system and compliance in the BASF Group were each a focus at one meeting of the Audit Committee. In these meetings, the head of the Corporate Audit department and the Chief Compliance Officer reported to the Audit Committee and answered its questions. In all meetings, the Audit Committee also received information on the development of risks from litigation.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing candidate proposals for the election of those Supervisory Board members who are elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the o bjectives

for the composition of the Supervisory Board adopted by the Supervisory Board. The Nomination Committee met once in 2016. All committee members attended the meeting. Its focus was the discussion of suitable candidates for the case of the early departure from the Supervisory Board of one of the members elected by the Annual Shareholder's M eeting.
The Strategy Committee, formed to consult on strategic options for the further development of the BASF Group, did not meet in 2016.
Corporate Governance and Declaration of Conformity
The Supervisory Board places great value on ensuring good corporate governance: In 2016, it was therefore once again intensely occupied with the corporate governance standards practiced in the company and the implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code's recommendations and suggestions. A further topic was the implementation of legal stipulations in BASF SE. This included the E.U.'s regulation on market abuse with the first-time introduction of legal "closed periods" in which share transactions are not permissible, as well as the Law on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public Sector. The Corporate Governance Report of the BASF Group provides extensive information on BASF's corporate governance. It also includes the Compensation Report, containing full details on the compensation for the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board.
At the meeting of December 15, 2016, current recommendations and proposals made for the German Corporate Governance Code and their implementation at BASF were discussed, along with the joint Declaration of Conformity by the Super visory Board and Board of Executive Directors in accordance with Section 161 of the Stock Corporation Act. BASF complies with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its version of May 5, 2015, without exception.
The full Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 150 and is available to shareholders on the company website at: basf.com/en/governance
Independence and efficiency review
An important aspect of good corporate governance is the independence of Supervisory Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest. According to assessments of the Supervisory Board, all of its members can be considered indep endent as defined by the German Corporate Governance Code. The criteria used for this evaluation can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 130. In cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence. The scope of these businesses is relatively marginal and furthermore takes place under conditions similar to those of a third party.

BASF Report 2016 

Corporate Governance 149
Report of the Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board reviews the efficiency of its activities e very year in the form of a self-assessment. This took place in 2016 as well, as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board conducted individual dialogs with each Supervisory Board member using a structured questionnaire. Topics especially centered on Supervisory Board meeting agendas; cooperation with the Board of Executive Directors; information supply of the Super visory Board; the Committees' duties, composition and work; and cooperation with shareholder and employee representatives. The results of these individual meetings were presented and thoroughly discussed at the Supervisory Board meeting on Decemb er 15, 2016. Overall, its members rated the Supervisory Board's activity as efficient.
The Audit Committee once again conducted a self-assessment of its activities in 2016, apart from the efficiency review. Material topic areas were the organization and content of the meetings and the supply of information as the basis of the Committees' work. No notable need for action was identified.
Separate and consolidated financial statements
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for the 2016 reporting year, has audited the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Management's Report and the accounting records from which they were prepared, and have approved them free of qualification. Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the measures incumbent on it under Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act in an appropriate manner. In particular, it had instituted an appropriate information and monitoring system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is applicable for the early identification of developm ents that could pose a risk to the continued existence of the BASF Group.
The documents to be examined and the auditor's reports were sent in a timely manner to every member of the S upervisory Board. The auditor attended the accounts review meeting of the Audit Committee on February 21, 2017, as well as the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 22, 2017, and reported on the main findings of the audit. The auditor also provided detailed explanations of the reports on the day before the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee reviewed the Financial Statements and Management's Report at its meeting on February 21, 2017, and discussed them in detail with the auditor. The Chairwoman of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of the preliminary review at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 22, 2017. On the basis of this preliminary review by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board has examined the Financial Statements and Management's Report of BASF SE for 2016,

the proposal by the Board of Executive Directors for the appropriation of profit as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Report for the BASF Group for 2016. The Supervisory Board has reviewed, acknowledged and approved the auditor's reports. The results of the preliminary review by the Audit Committee and the results of the Super visory Board's examination fully concur with those of the audit. The Supervisory Board sees no grounds for objection to the management and submitted reports.
At the Supervisory Board's accounts meeting on February 22, 2017, it approved the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors, making the 2016 Financial Statements of BASF SE final. The Supervisory Board concurs with the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors regarding the appropriation of profit and the payment of a dividend of 3.00 per share.
Composition of the Supervisory Board
Employee representative Wolfgang Daniel left the Supervisory Board at the conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2016. He was succeeded by Waldemar Helber, who joined the Supervisory Board as the successor appointed by the BASF Works Council Europe on December 4, 2013, in accordance with the Employee Participation Agreement of November 15, 2007. The Supervisory Board thanks Wolfgang Daniel, who had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1996, for his many years of service.

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors

Statement by the Board of Executive Directors and a ssurance pursuant to Sections 297(2) and 315(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)

The Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE is responsible for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements and M anagement's Report of the BASF Group.
The BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016 were prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, and have been endorsed by the European Union.
We have established effective internal control and steering systems in order to ensure that the BASF Group's Consoli dated Financial Statements and Management's Report comply with applicable accounting rules and to ensure proper corporate reporting.
The risk management system we have set up is designed such that the Board of Executive Directors can identify material risks early on and take appropriate defensive measures as necessary. The reliability and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system are continually audited throughout the Group by our internal audit department.

To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group, and the Management's Report of the BASF Group includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business as well as position of the BASF Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks a ssociated with the expected development of the BASF Group.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements p repared by BASF SE, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany, comprising the statement of income, statement of income and expense recognized in equity, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of equity and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements together with the Group Management's Report for the business year from January 1 to December 31, 2016. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management's Report in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are the responsibility of the parent company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management's Report based on our audit. In addition, we have been instructed to express an opinion as to whether the c onsolidated financial statements comply with full IFRS.
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial s tatements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group Management's Report are detected with reasonable

assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management's Report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the E.U., the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a(1) HGB and full IFRS and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The Group Management's Report is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, conforms to legal requirements, and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

BASF Report 2016

Policies and scope of consolidation
1Summary of accounting policies

1.1 General information BASF SE (registered at the district trade register, or Amtsgericht, for Ludwigshafen am Rhein, number HRB 6000 ) is a publicly listed corporation headquartered in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany. Its official address is C arl-Bosch-Str. 38, 67056 Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE as of December 31, 2016, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). IFRSs are generally only applied after they have been endorsed by the European Union. For the 2016 fiscal year, all of the binding IFRSs and pronouncements of the Inter national F inancial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros. All amounts, including the figures for previous years, are given in million euros unless otherwise indicated.
The individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies applied are largely the same as those used in 2015, with the exception of any changes arising from the application of new or revised standards.
In its meeting on February 20, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements, submitted them to the Supervisory Board for review and approval, and released them for publication.

Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 ­ Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization The IASB issued amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 on May 12, 2014. These revisions provide further guidance on determining an acceptable method of depreciation and a mortization. Revenue-based methods are not permissible for property, plant and equipment and are only permissible for intangible assets in specific exceptional cases (rebuttable presumption of inappropriateness). The changes are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The European Union's endorsement was issued on December 3, 2015. The amendments did not have a material effect on BASF.
Amendments to IAS 19 ­ Employee Contributions to Defined Benefit Plans The IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 on November 21, 2013. The amendments clarify requirements dealing with the allocation to service periods of employee or third- party contributions in cases where these are linked to the service period. Furthermore, practical expedients were made for cases where contributions are independent from the number of service years. The European Union endorsed the changes on January 9, 2015. In a deviation from the IASB's effective date (reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014), IFRS-based financial statements in the European Union must apply the amendments for reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015. The application of the amendments did not materially affect BASF.

1.2 Changes in accounting principles
Accounting policies applied for the first time in 2016
Amendments to IAS 1 ­ Disclosure Initiative On December 18, 2014, the IASB issued amendments made to IAS 1. The amendments pertain to various disclosure requirements. It is made clear that information needs to be disclosed in the notes only if this is material for the company. This explicitly applies if a standard calls for a list of minimum disclosures. Explanations are moreover provided on the aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income. Furthermore, the revised standard clarifies how an entity's share of the other comprehensive income of equity-accounted companies is to be p resented in the statement of comprehensive income. The changes are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on December 19, 2015. Due to the recent revision of IAS 1, the contributions of companies accounted for using the equity method are now shown separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition, noncontrolling interests have been distributed among the subitems under the separate "minority interests" column.

Amendments to IFRS 11 ­ Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 11 on May 6, 2014. IFRS 11 includes regulations on the recognition of assets and liabilities and gains or losses of joint ventures and joint operations. Whereas joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, joint operations, according to IFRS 11, are recognized in a similar fashion to proportional consolidation. With the amendment to IFRS 11, IASB regulates the accounting for the acquisition of shares in a joint operation, which constitutes a business according to IFRS 3 ­ Business Combinations. In such cases, the acquirer shall apply the principles of accounting for business combinations according to IFRS 3. Furthermore, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 3 also apply in such cases. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on N ovember 25, 2015. BASF did not acquire shares in a joint operation in 2016.

IFRS Annual Improvements Cycle 2010­2012 Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued amendments to several standards on December 12, 2013. The affected standards are IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 8, IFRS 13, IAS 16, IAS 24 and IAS 38. The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to standardize terminology. The European Union endorsed the changes on January 9, 2015. In a deviation from the IASB's effective date (reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014), IFRS-based financial statements in the European Union must apply the amendments for reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015. The application of the amendments did not materially affect BASF.
IFRS Annual Improvements Cycle 2012­2014 Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued amendments to several standards on September 25, 2014. The affected standards are IAS 19, IAS 34, IFRS 5 and IFRS 7. The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to standardize terminology. The changes are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. An e ndorsement by the European Union was issued on December 16, 2015. The application of the amendments did not materially affect BASF.
IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered
The effects on the BASF Group financial statements of the IFRSs and IFRICs not yet in force or not yet endorsed by the European Union in 2016 were reviewed and are explained below.
IFRS 9 ­ Financial Instruments On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9, concluding the multiyear project to replace IAS 39 ­ Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 contains new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of financial asset impairments, and a reformed approach to hedge accounting. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The European Union endorsed the standard in the fourth quarter of 2016.
IFRS 9 retains "amortized cost" and "fair value" as the criteria for measuring financial instruments. Whether financial assets are measured at amortized cost or fair value will d epend on two factors: the entity's business model for managing the portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
In the future, the recognition of financial asset impairments is based on expected losses according to IFRS 9. The general approach adopts a three-stage model to assess the provisions for risks. The model requires different degrees of impairment based on the credit default risk of the counterparties. For certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts receivable, operational simplifications for recognizing impairment losses apply.

The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a closer alignment of hedge accounting with the entity's risk management strategy.
The new requirements for classification and measurement could have an impact on the accounting treatment of other shareholdings. BASF currently measures almost all of these shareholdings at amortized cost, in line with IAS 39.46c. Because IFRS 9 does not contain any comparable regulations, BASF is currently reviewing what represents the best metric for estimating fair value on a case-by-case basis. BASF will determine on an instrument-by-instrument basis whether measurement will take place at fair value through other c omprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss.
As IFRS 9 introduces a cash flow condition that needs to be considered in classifying financial assets, it is possible that financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as per IAS 39 may, in the future, need to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. BASF will conduct this analysis in 2017. Impacts may especially be observed for securities that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets and thus m easured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Depending on the cash flow characteristics of these financial instruments, measurement at fair value through profit or loss may be required in the future.
Recognition of expected losses for trade accounts receivable will largely take place on the basis of internal and external customer ratings and the associated probability of default.
Furthermore, the new impairment model is also to be used for other financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as bank balances, loan receivables and miscellaneous receivables to the extent that they represent financial instruments. As no group-wise individual valuation allowances are currently calculated for such financial assets, the introduction of IFRS 9 will probably mean an increase in the risk provision. This effect cannot yet be reliably quantified.
With regard to new hedge accounting regulations, BASF assumes that, in principle, all existing hedge accounting relationships may be continued under IFRS 9. It has not yet been fully determined how the accounting choices concerning the designation of derivatives, as introduced by IFRS 9, will be exercised.
BASF has not opted for early application of the new standard. At the moment, BASF assumes that the new regulations can be applied prospectively to a large extent. The difference in the impairment amount that will arise upon transition to IFRS 9 will be recognized in equity at the b eginning of the business year of the first-time adoption of the standard. Exceptions to the prospective application are the regulations on accounting for the time value of options if only the intrinsic value is designated, and the analysis of the cash flow condition that generally pertains to the point in time of the first recognition of each financial instrument.

Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2016

IFRS 15 ­ Revenues from Contracts with Customers The IASB published the new standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15, on May 28, 2014. The revised standard particularly aims to standardize existing regulations and thus improve transparency and the comparability of financial information. The rules and definitions of IFRS 15 supersede the content of IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. BASF does not plan to adopt the standard early. The European Union endorsed the standard in 2016.
The new standard does not differentiate between different types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to IFRS 15, sales revenue is recognized when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. Sales revenue is measured as the amount the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods and services.
The new model for the determination of revenue recog nition is based on five steps: ­­Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer ­­Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract ­­Step 3: Determine the transaction price ­­Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract ­­Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation
The new standard's potential impact on BASF's net assets, financial position and results of operations is being assessed. A Group-wide analysis was conducted to investigate the e xtent to which BASF is affected by the new standard.
First, the major types of contracts were identified at an operating division level and analyzed with regard to the changes in accounting under IFRS 15. Based on the results, the need for adjustment is currently being assessed.
Analysis of the contracts showed that contracts with customers almost exclusively contain one service component or a number of similar service components and that these must be fulfilled by a certain point in time. Furthermore, contracts with customers were identified that could lead, according to IFRS 15, to a shift in time of revenue recognition. These are mainly contracts with several contractual obligations and revenues from issuing licenses. In such cases, revenue recognition according to IFRS 15 will take place at both an earlier and later point in time than it had been previously. BASF assumes that fulfillment of the new standard's requirements will necessitate the introduction of the balance sheet items "contractual asset" and "contractual liability" as well as more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The analyses showed no grounds to expect material impact on BASF's results of operations or net assets.

BASF is currently planning to apply IFRS 15 for the first time on January 1, 2018, by adjusting equity in the amount of the c umulative effect (modified retroactive application).
IFRS 16 ­ Leases The IASB published the new standard on leasing, IFRS 16, on January 13, 2016. The rules and definitions of IFRS 16 supersede the content of IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27. The standard requires an accounting model for a lessee that recognizes all assets and liabilities from leasing agreements in the balance sheet, unless the term is twelve months or less or the underlying asset is of low value. As for the lessor, the new standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements of IAS 17 ­ Leases. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. An endorsement by the European Union is still pending. BASF does not plan on early adoption and will likely recognize the cumulative adjustment effect in equity on J anuary 1, 2019.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ­ Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 on September 11, 2014. The amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (2011) in the case of the sale of an asset to an associated company or a joint venture or the contribution of an asset to an associated company or a joint venture. According to IFRS 10, if the disposal of a subsidiary by a parent company results in a loss of control, it recognizes the gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary in the full amount in the income statement. In contrast, the currently applicable IAS 28.28 requires that a gain on sales transactions between an investor and an investment accounted for using the equity method ­ whether it be an associated company or joint venture ­ is recognized only to the extent of the investor's interests in the associated company or joint venture. In the future, the entire gain or loss arising from a transaction shall only be recognized when the assets sold or contributed constitute a business combination according to IFRS 3. This applies regardless of whether the transaction is a share or asset deal. Only a pro rata recognition of gain is permissible if the assets do not constitute a business combination. IASB has postponed the effective date of the changes indefinitely.

IASB issued further amendments to standards and interpretations whose application is not yet mandatory and whose a pplication also requires the endorsement of E.U. law. These amendments are unlikely to have a material impact on the reporting of BASF SE.
Amendments to IAS 7 ­ Statement of Cash Flows: The amendments pursue the objective that entities provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to e valuate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendments are ­ subject to E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied for the first time in the first reporting period of a business year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, although early adoption is permissible.
Amendments to IAS 12 ­ Income Taxes: The amendments to IAS 12 particularly aim to clarify how to account for deferred tax assets for unrealized losses related to assets measured at fair value, which are currently handled variously in practice. The amendments are ­ subject to E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied for the first time in the first reporting period of a business year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, although early adoption is permissible.
Amendments to IFRS 2 ­ Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions: The amendments involve a number of individual issues pertaining to the accounting of cash-settled share-based payment transactions. IFRS 2 now contains requirements on determining the fair value of obligations resulting from share-based payment transactions. The amendments are ­ pending E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied to compensation granted or changed in business years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permissible.
Amendments to IFRS 4 ­ Insurance Contracts: The amendments aim to minimize the effects of various first-time application dates of IFRS 9, especially for entities with extensive insurance activities. The amendments are ­ pending E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied for the first time starting January 1, 2018.
Supplementary information on IFRS 15 ­ Revenues from Contracts with Customers: The amendments clarify various regulations in IFRS 15 and provide transition relief for the new standard. Beyond clarification, the changed standard also contains two additional practical expedients for reducing complexity and cost in the transfer to the new standard. These concern options for the presentation of contracts that are either concluded by the start of the earliest-presented period or that have been changed before the start of the earliest- presented period. The amendments are ­ pending E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied for the first time starting January 1, 2018.
Supplementary information on IFRIC 22 ­ Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration: IFRIC 22 addresses an application question for IAS 21 ­ The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. It clarifies the point in time for determining the exchange rate used to translate foreign-currency transactions containing advance payments that have been made or received. The date of the initial recognition of an asset or liability resulting from advance

consideration is essential for determining the exchange rate for the underlying asset, income or expense. The interpretation is ­ pending E.U. endorsement ­ to be applied for the first time in the first reporting period of a business year beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permissible.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014­2016): Three IFRSs were amended in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014­2016). In IFRS 12, it was clarified that disclosures pursuant to IFRS 12 generally also apply to an entity's interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, with the exception of the disclosures outlined in IFRS 12.B10­B16 (Financial Information). In IAS 28, it was clarified that the election to measure an investment in an associated company or a joint venture held by an entity that is a venture capital o rganization or other qualifying entity, can be exercised on an investment-by-investment basis. The short-term exemptions in IFRS 1, Appendix E (IFRS 1.E3­E7) for first-time IFRS users were deleted. Pending E.U. endorsement, the amendments to IFRS 12 are to be applied for the first time in the first reporting period of a business year beginning on or after J anuary 1, 2017. Early adoption is permissible.
1.3 Group accounting principles Scope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based on the application of the standards IFRS 10 and 11.
According to IFRS 10, a group consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. "Control" of an investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three criteria: ­­The parent company holds decision-making power over the
relevant activities of the investee ­­The parent company has rights to variable returns from the
investee ­­The parent company can use its decision-making power to
affect the variable returns
Based on corporate governance and potential supplementary agreements, companies are analyzed for their relevant activities and variable returns, and the link between the v ariable returns and the extent to which their relevant activities could be influenced.
According to IFRS 11, which regulates the accounting of joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of a legally independent c ompany have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely transferred to the partners, through which the partners g uarantee the joint arrangements' ongoing financing.

164 Consolidated Financial S tatements 
Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2016

Companies whose corporate governance structures classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations as per IFRS 11. This requires an analysis of the joint arrangement's structure. Should the arrangement be structured through a separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements and all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.
In addition to BASF SE, the Consolidated Financial Statements include all material subsidiaries on a fully consolidated and all material joint operations on a propor tionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of secondary importance for the presentation of a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations, are not conso lidated, but rather are reported under other shareholdings. These companies are carried at amortized cost and are written down in the case of an impairment. The aggregate assets and equity of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at the Group level.
Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Associated companies are entities in which significant influence can be exercised over their operating and financial policies and which are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or joint operations. In general, this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%. Equity-accounted income is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT).
Consolidation methods: Assets and liabilities of conso lidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance with the principles described herein. For equity-accounted companies, material deviations in measurement resulting from the application of other accounting p rinciples than those used at BASF are adjusted for.
Transactions between consolidated companies as well as intercompany profits resulting from trade between consoli dated companies are eliminated in full; for joint operations, they are proportionally eliminated. Material intercompany profits related to companies accounted for using the equity method are eliminated.
Capital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured at fair value. Finally, the acquisition cost is compared with the proportional share of the net assets acquired at fair value. The resulting positive differences are capitalized as goodwill. Negative differences are reviewed once more, then recognized directly in the income statement.
The incidental acquisition costs of a business combination are recognized in the income statement under other operating expenses.

Foreign currency translations: The cost of assets acquired in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Changes in assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency translation are recognized in the income statement and reported under other operating expenses or income, other financial result, and available-for-sale financial assets in other comprehensive income.
Translation of foreign currency financial statements: The translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the consolidated companies. For companies whose functional currency is not the euro but a local currency, translation into the reporting currency is based on the closing rate method: Balance sheet items are translated into euros using closing rates on the b alance sheet date; expenses and income are translated into euros at monthly average rates and accumulated for the year. The difference between a company's translated equity at h istorical rates at the time of acquisition or retention and its equity at closing rates on the balance sheet date is reported separately in equity under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in income only upon the company's disposal.
For certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In such cases, the translation into the functional currency of financial statements prepared in the local currency is done according to the temporal method: All nonmonetary assets and related depreciation and amortization as well as equity are translated at the exchange rate applying to the respective transactions. All other balance sheet items are translated using closing rates on the balance sheet date; other expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates. The resulting translation differences are recognized in the income statement under other operating income or expenses. If necessary, financial statements in the functional currency are translated into the presentation currency according to the closing rate method.

1.4 Accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenues from the sale of goods or the rendering of services are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk to the buyer. They are measured at the fair value of the consideration received. Sales revenues are reported without sales tax. E xpected rebates and other trade discounts are accrued or deducted. Provisions are recognized according to the principle of individual measurement to cover probable risks related to the return of products, future warranty obligations and other claims.
Revenues from the sale of precious metals to industrial customers are recognized at the time of shipment and the corresponding purchase prices are recorded at cost of sales. In the trading of precious metals and their derivatives with broker-traders, where there is usually no physical delivery, revenues are netted against their corresponding costs. Revenues from marketing the natural gas from the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field are treated in the same manner.
Income relating to the sale or licensing of technologies or technological expertise are recognized in the income statement according to the contractually agreed-upon transfer of the rights and obligations associated with those technologies.
Assets
Acquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined useful lives are valued at cost less straight-line a mortization. The useful life is determined using the period of the underlying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.
Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development expenses or other operating expenses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.

Internally generated intangible assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other internally generated assets are measured at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of internally generated intangible assets also include an appropriate portion of overhead costs. Borrowing costs are capitalized to the extent that they apply to the purchase or the period of construction of qualifying assets.
The estimated useful lives and amortization methods of intangible assets are based on historical values, plans and estimates. These estimates also consider the period and distribution of future cash inflows and outflows. The w eighted average amortization periods of intangible assets amounted to:

Average amortization in years
Distribution, supply and similar rights Product rights, licenses and trademarks Know-how, patents and production technologies Internally generated intangible assets Other rights and values

14 4 5

2015 14 18
12 4 7

Emission rights: Emission right certificates, granted free of charge by the German Emissions Trading Authority (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized on the balance sheet with a value of zero. Certificates purchased on the market are capitalized at cost as intangible assets. Emissions generated create an obligation to surrender the emission certificates. Emission certificates p urchased on the market are subsequently measured at fair value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition costs. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the b alance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.
Goodwill is only written down if there is an impairment. Impairment testing takes place once a year and whenever there is an indication of an impairment.
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment over their useful lives. The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully written off in the year of acquisition.

Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2016

The cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs, appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions involved in the construction of the plants. Borrowing costs are capitalized to the extent that they apply to the purchase or the period of construction of qualifying assets.
Expenditures related to the scheduled maintenance of large-scale plants are separately capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the period until the next planned turnaround. Costs for the replacement of components are recognized as assets when an additional future benefit is expected. The carrying amount of the replaced components is derecognized. Costs for maintenance and repair as part of normal business operations are recognized as an expense.
Both movable and immovable fixed assets are for the most part depreciated using the straight-line method, with the exception of production licenses and plants in the Oil & Gas segment, which are primarily depreciated based on use in accordance with the unit of production method. The estimated useful lives and depreciation methods applied are based on historical values, plans and estimates. These estimates also consider the period and distribution of future cash inflows and outflows. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The weighted average depreciation periods were as follows:

Weighted average depreciation in years

Buildings and structural installations Machinery and technical equipment Long-distance natural gas pipelines Miscellaneous equipment and fixtures

2016 22 10 25 7

2015 23 10 25 7

Impairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. An impairment is recognized for the difference between the c arrying amount and the recoverable amount. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are r eversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized.
Investment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair value or acquisition cost less depreciation.
Leases: A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor c onveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in return for a payment or series of payments. Leasing contracts are classified as either finance or operating leases.

Assets subject to operating leases are not capitalized. Lease payments are recognized in the income statement in the period they are incurred.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it substantially transfers all the risks and rewards related to the leased asset. Assets subject to a finance lease are capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease payments. A leasing liability is recorded in the same amount. The periodic lease payments must be divided into principal and interest components. The principal component reduces the outstanding liability, while the interest component represents an interest expense. Depreciation takes place over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the period of the lease.
Leases can be embedded within other contracts. If separation is required under IFRS, then the embedded lease is recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is carried and measured in accordance with the applicable regulations. 
Borrowing costs: Borrowing costs directly incurred as part of the acquisition, construction or production of a q ualifying asset are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which the time period necessary to make it ready for its intended use or sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. The borrowing costs were calculated based on a rate of 2.5% (2015: 3.0%) and adjusted on a country-specific basis, if necessary. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants: Government grants related to the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment reduce the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets. Other government grants or government assistance are recognized immediately as other operating income or treated as deferred income and reversed over the underlying period.
Investments accounted for using the equity method: The carrying amounts of these companies are adjusted a nnually based on the pro rata share of net income, dividends and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a permanent reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment is recognized in the income statement.
Inventories are measured at acquisition cost or cost of conversion based on the weighted average method. If the market price or fair value of the sales product which forms the basis for the net realizable value is lower, then the sales products are written down to this lower value. The net realizable value is the estimated price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the e stimated selling costs.

BASF Report 2016

Consolidated Financial S tatements 167
Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

In addition to direct costs, cost of conversion includes an appropriate allocation of production overhead costs based on normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that they are related to the production process. Pensions, social services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as well as allocations for administrative costs, provided they relate to the production. Borrowing costs are not included in cost of conversion.
Inventories may be written down if the prices for the sales products decline, or in cases of a high rate of days sales of inventory (DSI). Write-downs on inventories are reversed if the reasons for them no longer apply.
The exception made by IAS 2 for traders is applied to the measurement of precious metal inventories. Accordingly, inventories held exclusively for trading purposes are to be measured at fair value less costs to sell. All changes in value are recognized in the income statement.
Deferred taxes: Deferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. This also comprises temporary differences arising from business combinations, with the exception of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated u sing the respective country-specific tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is realized or settled. Tax rate changes enacted or substantively enacted on or b efore the balance sheet date are taken into consideration.
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority and have the same maturities. Surpluses of deferred tax assets are only recognized provided that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on the estimated probability of a reversal of the differences and the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. This depends on whether future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits can be claimed. Based on experience and the expected development of taxable income, it is assumed that the benefits of the recognized deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on internal projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company.
Changes in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded as deferred tax expense or income if the underlying transaction is not to be recognized directly in equity or in income and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects which have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these dif ferences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for dividend distributions which are planned for the following year if these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences.
For more information, see Note 11 from page 185 onward
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when the BASF Group becomes a party to a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the financial asset, with all risks and rewards of ownership, is transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation expires, is discharged or cancelled. Regular-way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious metals trading, the day of trading is used.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When pricing on an active market is available, for example on a stock exchange, this price is used for the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based on internal measurement models using current market parameters or external measurements, for example, from banks. These internal measurements predominantly use the net present value method and option pricing models.
If there is objective evidence of a permanent impairment of a financial instrument that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, an impairment loss is recognized. If the reason for the impairment of loans and receivables as well as held-to-maturity financial instruments no longer exists, the impairment is reversed up to the amortized cost and recognized in the income statement. Impairments on financial instruments are booked in separate accounts.
Financial assets and liabilities are divided into the following measurement categories: ­­Financial assets and liabilities at fair value recognized in
the income statement consist of derivatives and other trading instruments. At BASF, this measurement category only includes derivatives. Derivatives are reported in other receivables and miscellaneous assets or other liabilities. BASF does not make use of the fair value option under IAS 39. The calculation of fair values is based on market parameters or measurement models based on such parameters. In some exceptional cases, the fair value is calculated using parameters which are not observable on the market.

168 Consolidated Financial Statements 
Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

BASF Report 2016

­­Loans and receivables comprise financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, which are not quoted on an active market and are not derivatives or classified as available-for-sale. This measurement category includes trade accounts receivable as well as other receivables and loans reported under other receivables and miscellaneous assets. Initial measurement is done at fair value, which generally matches the nominal value of the receivable or loan. Interest-free and low-interest long-term loans and receivables are recorded at present value. Subsequent measurement recognized in income is generally made at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is objective evidence for an impairment of a receivable or loan, an individual valuation allowance is made. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, regional and sector-specific conditions are considered. In addition, use is made of internal and external ratings as well as the assessments of debt collection agencies and credit insurers, when available. A portion of receivables is covered by credit insurance. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an insignificant extent. Valuation allowances are only recognized for those receivables which are not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible. Write-downs are based on historical values relating to customer solvency and the age, period overdue, insurance policies and customer-specific risks. In addition, a valuation allowance must be recognized when the contractual conditions which form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the p resent value of the future cash flows decreases.  Furthermore, valuation allowances are made on r eceivables based on transfer risks for certain countries. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the valuation allowance decreases and the decrease can be related o bjectively to an event occurring after the valuation allowance was made, then it must be reversed in the income statement. Reversals of valuation allowances may not exceed amortized cost. Loans and receivables are derecognized when they are definitively found to be uncollectible.
­­Held-to-maturity financial assets consist of nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed term, for which there is the ability and intent to hold until maturity, and which do not fall under other valuation categories. Initial measurement is done at fair value, which matches the nominal value in most cases. Subsequent m easurement is carried out at amortized cost, using the e ffective interest method. For BASF, there are no material financial assets that fall under this category.

­­Available-for-sale financial assets comprise financial assets which are not derivatives and do not fall under any of the previously stated valuation categories. This measurement category comprises shareholdings reported under the item other financial assets which are not accounted for using the equity method as well as short and long-term securities. The measurement is carried out at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized directly in equity under the item other comprehensive income and are only recognized in the income statement when the assets are disposed of or have been impaired. Subsequent reversals are recognized directly in equity (other comprehensive income). Only in the case of debt instruments are reversals recognized up to the amount of the original impairment in the income statement; reversals above this amount are recognized directly in equity. If the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets drops below acquisition costs, the assets are impaired if the d ecline in value is significant and can be considered lasting. The fair values are determined using market prices. S hareholdings whose fair value cannot be reliably determined are carried at acquisition cost and are written down in the case of an impairment. When determining the value of these shareholdings, the acquisition costs constitute the best estimate of their fair value. This category of shareholdings includes investments in other shareholdings, p rovided that these shares are not publicly traded. There are no plans to sell significant stakes in these shareholdings.
­­Financial liabilities which are not derivatives are initially measured at fair value, which normally corresponds to the amount received. Subsequent measurement is carried out at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.
­­Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand and bank balances with maturities of less than three months.
There were no reclassifications from one measurement category to another in 2016 and 2015. The same applies for transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
Revenue from interest-bearing assets is recognized on the outstanding receivables on the balance sheet date using interest rates calculated by means of the effective interest method. Dividends from shareholdings not accounted for using the equity method are recognized when the share holders' right to receive payment is established.
Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts. If IFRS requires separation, then the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host c ontract and measured at fair value.

Financial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts that require compensation payments to be made to the guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms of the financial guarantee. Financial guarantees given by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In subsequent periods, financial guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present obligation on the financial reporting date.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for selected deals to hedge future transactions. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is thereby recognized d irectly in equity under other comprehensive income, taking deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case of future transactions that will lead to a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial debt, the cumulative fair value changes in equity are either charged against the acquisition costs on initial recognition or recognized in profit or loss in the reporting p eriod in which the hedged item is recorded in the income statement. For hedges based on financial assets or debts, the cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. The maturity of the hedging instrument is determined based on the effective date of the future transaction.
When fair value hedges are used, the asset or liability is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. Here, c hanges in the market value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement. Furthermore, the carrying amount of the underlying transaction is adjusted by the profit or loss resulting from the hedged risk, offsetting the effect in the income statement.
Other comprehensive income
The income and expenses shown in other comprehensive income are divided into two categories. Items that will be recognized in the income statement in the future (known as "recycling") and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in the future. The first category includes translation adjustments, the measurement of securities at fair value, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to hedge future cash flows and net investments in a foreign operation. Items in other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to the income statement at a future date include effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.

Debt
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations: Provisions for pensions are based on actuarial computations made according to the projected unit credit method, which applies for valuation parameters that include: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee turnover and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations are discounted on the balance sheet date using the market yields on high-quality corporate fixed-rate bonds with a minimum of one AA rating.
Similar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.
The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports.
Actuarial gains and losses from changed estimations with regard to the actuarial assumptions used for calculating defined benefit obligations, the difference between standardized and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of the asset ceiling are recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income.
For more information on provisions for pensions and similar obligations, see Note 22 from page 198 onward
Other provisions: Other provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event and when there is a probable outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value.
Provisions for German trade income tax, German corporate income tax and similar income taxes are determined and recognized in the amount necessary to meet the expected payment obligations less any prepayments that have been made. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accordingly.
Provisions are established for certain environmental protection measures and risks if there exist present legal or constructive obligations arising from a past event, and the expected cash outflow can be estimated with sufficient reliability. Provisions for restoration obligations primarily concern the filling of wells and the removal of production facilities upon the termination of production in the Oil & Gas segment. When the obligation arises, the provision is measured at the present value of the future restoration costs. An asset is capitalized for the same amount as part of the carrying amount of the plant concerned and is depreciated along with the plant. The discount on the provision is unwound annually until the time of the planned restoration.

In addition, other provisions also cover expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination from existing pro duction or storage sites and similar measures. If BASF is the only responsible party that can be identified, the provision covers the entire expected claim. At sites operated together with one or more partners, the provision generally covers only BASF's share of the expected claim. The determination of the amount of the provision is based on the available technical information on the site, the technology used, legal regulations, and official obligations.
Provisions are recognized for expected severance payments or similar personnel expenses as well as for demolition expenses and other charges related to restructuring measures that have been planned and publicly announced by management.
Provisions for long-service and anniversary bonuses are predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles. For contracts signed under the early retirement programs, approved supplemental payments are accrued in installments until the end of the exemption phase at the latest. Accounting and measurement follow the German Accounting Standards Committee e.V.'s Application Note 1 (IFRS) of December 2012.
Other provisions also cover risks resulting from legal disputes and proceedings, provided the criteria for recognizing a provision are fulfilled. In order to determine the amount of the provisions, the Company takes into consideration the facts related to each case, the size of the claim, claims awarded in similar cases and independent expert advice as well as assumptions regarding the probability of a successful claim and the range of possible claims. The actual costs can deviate from these estimates.
For more information, see Note 26 on page 207
The probable amount required to settle noncurrent p rovisions is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this case, the provision is recognized at present value. A ssumptions must be made in determining the discount rate used for calculating noncurrent provisions. Financing costs related to unwinding the discount on provisions in subsequent periods are shown in other financial result.
Other accounting policies
Business combinations: In business combinations, the a cquired assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on the date the acquirer effectively obtains control. The fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of e xchange, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets, are determined on the basis of assumptions. The measurement is largely based on projected cash flows. The actual cash

flows can differ significantly from the cash flows used to determine the fair values. Independent external appraisals are used for the purchase price allocation of business combinations. Valuations in the course of business combinations are based on existing information as of the acquisition date.
Oil and gas production: Exploration and development expenditures are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory drilling as well as successful and dry development wells are capitalized.
An exploration well is a well located outside of an area with proven oil and gas reserves. A development well is a well which is drilled to the depth of a reservoir of oil or gas within an area with proven reserves.
Exploratory drilling is generally reported under construction in progress until its success can be determined. When the presence of hydrocarbons is proven such that the economic development of the field is probable, the costs remain c apitalized as suspended well costs. At least once a year, all suspended wells are assessed from an economic, technical and strategic viewpoint to see if development is still intended. If this is not the case, the capitalized costs for the well in question are impaired. When reserves are proven, the exploration wells are reclassified as machinery and technical equipment when production begins.
Production costs include all costs incurred to operate, repair and maintain the wells as well as the associated plant and ancillary production equipment, including the associated depreciation.
The unit of production method is used to depreciate assets from oil and gas production at the field or reservoir level. Depreciation is generally calculated on the basis of the production of the period in relation to the proven, developed reserves.
Exploration expenses pertain exclusively to the Oil & Gas segment and include all costs related to areas with unproven oil or gas deposits. These include costs for the exploration of areas with possible oil or gas deposits, among others. Costs for geological and geophysical investigations are always reported under exploration expenses. In addition, this item includes valuation allowances for capitalized expenses for exploration wells which did not encounter proven reserves. Depreciation of successful exploratory drilling is reported under cost of sales.
An Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement is a type of contract in crude oil and gas concessions whereby the expenses and profits from the exploration, development and production phases are divided between the state and one or more exploration and production companies using defined keys. The revenue BASF is entitled to under such contracts is reported as sales.

Consolidated Financial S tatements 171
Notes -- Policies and scope of consolidation

The intangible asset from the marketing contract for natural gas from the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field is amortized based on BASF's share of the produced and distributed volumes.
Intangible assets in the Oil & Gas segment relate primarily to exploration and production rights. During the exploration phase, these are not subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually. When economic success is determined, the rights are amortized in accordance with the unit of production method.
Use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements
The carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and other financial obligations in the C onsolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of estimates, assumptions and use of discretionary scope. Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective sections. They are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date and affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. These assumptions particularly concern discounted cash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations; the determination of useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; the carrying amount of investments; and the measurement of provisions for such things as employee benefits, warranties, trade discounts, environmental protection and taxes. Although uncertainty is appropriately incorporated in the valuation factors, actual results can differ from these estimates.
The assumptions for oil and gas prices concern internal company projections. The projections are based on an empirical analysis of the global oil and gas supply and demand. Short-term estimates up to three years consider the current prices on active markets or forward transactions. In long-term estimates, assumptions are made regarding factors such as inflation, production quantities and costs as well as energy efficiency and the substitution of energy sources. Using external sources and reports, the oil and gas price estimates are regularly checked for plausibility.

Impairment tests are based on a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. As a rule, value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The estimation of cash flows and the assumptions used consider all information available on the respective balance sheet date on the future development of the operating business. Actual future developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cash-generating unit's long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on economic trends. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model plays an important role in impairment testing. It comprises a risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the spread for the credit risk. Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used.
For more information, see Note 14 from page 189 onward
An impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impairment of the asset (excluding goodwill) is made in the amount of the difference between these amounts.
The goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units. At BASF, the cash-generating units are predominantly the business units, or in certain cases, the divisions. If there is a need for a valuation allowance, the existing goodwill is, if necessary, completely written off as a first step. If there is further need for a valuation allowance, this is allocated to the remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Goodwill impairments are reported under other operating expenses. Impairment reversals are not conducted for goodwill.

Impairment tests on assets are carried out whenever certain triggering events indicate that an impairment may be necessary. External triggering events include, for example, changes in customer industries, technologies used and economic downturns. Internal triggering events for an impairment test include lower product profitability, planned restructuring m easures or physical damage to assets.

Goodwill in the amount of 1,545 million resulted primarily from sales synergies, arising from the expansion of the port folio as well as cost synergies to a minor extent. Chemetall contributed 32 million to sales in the fiscal year 2016 and minus 5 million to net income. With the consolidation of Chemetall in the Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF as of January 1, 2016, sales would have amounted to 768 million and net income 77 million. These proforma results are for comparison purposes and do not necessarily represent the results had the transaction taken place on J anuary 1, 2016, and are not indicative of future developments and results.
The purchase prices for businesses acquired in 2016 totaled 2,872 million; as of December, 31, 2016, payments made for these amounted to 2,849 million. The purchase price allocations were based on valuations in accordance with IFRS 3. The resulting goodwill amounted to 1,552 million.

The purchase price allocations consider all the facts and cir cumstances prevailing as of the respective dates of acquisition which were known prior to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with IFRS 3, should further facts and circumstances become known within the 12-month measurement period, the purchase price allocation will be adjusted accordingly.
In 2015, BASF acquired the following activities: ­­On February 12, 2015, BASF concluded the acquisition,
announced on December 8, 2014, of the business from Taiwan Sheen Soon Co., Ltd. (TWSS), Lukang Town, Taiwan. TWSS is a leading manufacturer of precursors for adhesives based on thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). Following receipt of the official approval, BASF also took over TWSS's activities on the Chinese mainland, effective December 1, 2015. The takeover consolidated BASF's market p osition in the areas of TPU extrusion and injection molding for various industries. BASF can now offer its customers complete solutions for TPUs and TPU adhesives. At BASF, the activities have been integrated in the Performance Materials division ­­On February 18, 2015, BASF took over technologies, p atents and know-how for silver nanowires from Seashell Technology LLC, based in San Diego, California. Through this acquisition, BASF has extended its product portfolio for displays in the Electronic Materials business unit, which is part of the Monomers division ­­On February 24, 2015, BASF acquired a 66% share from TODA KOGYO CORP., based in Hiroshima, Japan, in a company to which TODA had contributed its business with cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, patents and production capacities in Japan. The transaction had been announced on October 30, 2014. The company focuses on the research, development, production, marketing and sales of a number of cathode materials. At BASF, the activities were assigned to the Catalysts division ­­On March 31, 2015, BASF concluded the acquisition of the polyurethane (PU) business from Polioles, S.A. de C.V., based in Lerma, Mexico, that was announced on July 10, 2014. Polioles is a joint venture with the Alpek Group. BASF holds a 50% share, which is accounted for using the equity method. The acquisition comprised m arketing and selling rights, current assets, and to a minor extent, production facilities. The business has been assigned to the Performance Materials division ­­On April 23, 2015, BASF concluded an agreement with Lanxess Aktiengesellschaft, based in Cologne, Germany, on the acquisition and use of technologies and patents for the production of high-molecular-weight polyisobutene (HM PIB). The transaction furthermore included the acquisition of selling rights and current assets as well as a manufacturing agreement in which Lanxess will produce HM PIB exclusively for BASF. The activities were allocated to the Performance Chemicals division
The following overview shows the effects of the acquisitions conducted in 2016 and 2015 on the Consolidated Financial Statements. If acquisitions resulted in the transfer of assets or the assumption of additional liabilities, these are shown as a net impact.

­­On September 30, 2015, BASF concluded the agreed-upon sale of portions of its pharmaceutical ingredients and services business to Siegfried Holding AG, based in Zofingen, Switzerland. This involved the custom synthesis business and parts of the active pharmaceutical ingredients portfolio. The transaction comprised the divestiture of the production sites in Minden, Germany; Evionnaz, Switzerland; and Saint- Vulbas, France. At BASF, the activities had been allocated to the Nutrition & Health division
­­On November 1, 2015, BASF divested its global paper hydrous kaolin business to Imerys Kaolin, Inc., Roswell, Georgia. The divestiture included the kaolin processing production site in Wilkinson County, Georgia. The activities at BASF had been allocated to the Performance Chemicals division
Asset swap with Gazprom In its Oil & Gas segment, BASF concluded the swap of assets of equal value with Gazprom on September 30, 2015, with retroactive economic effect to April 1, 2013. As a result of the transaction, BASF received an economic share of 25.01% in blocks IV and V of the Achimov formation of the Urengoy natural gas and condensate field in western Siberia. According to the development plan originally confirmed by Russian a uthorities, blocks IV and V have total hydrocarbon resources of 274 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 74 million metric tons of condensate. Production is scheduled to start up in 2018.
In return, BASF transferred its shares in the previously jointly run natural gas trading and storage business to G azprom. This included the 50.02% shares in the following: the natural gas trading company WINGAS GmbH, Kassel, Germany; the storage company astora GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, Germany, which operates natural gas storage facilities in Rehden and Jemgum, Germany; and WINGAS Holding GmbH, Kassel, Germany, including its share in the natural

gas storage facility in Haidach, Austria. BASF also transferred its 50% share in each of the natural gas trading companies W intershall Erdgas Handelshaus GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany, and Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus Zug AG, Zug, Switzerland. Gazprom furthermore became a 50% share holder in Wintershall Noordzee B.V. in Rijswijk, Netherlands, which is active in the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil deposits in the North Sea.

The following overview shows the individual components of BASF's profit realization from the asset swap with Gazprom and the transfer of Wintershall Noordzee B.V.: The final p urchase price allocation resulted in an adjustment of the fair value of the shareholding in Wintershall Noordzee B.V. and the compensation payment, and reduced disposal gains by 17 million to 297 million.

4 Reporting by segment and region

BASF's business is conducted by thirteen operating divisions aggregated into five segments for reporting purposes. The d ivisions are allocated to the segments based on their business models.
The Chemicals segment entails the classical chemicals business with basic chemicals and intermediates. It forms the core of BASF's Production Verbund and is the starting point for a majority of the value chains. In addition to supplying the chemical industry and numerous other sectors, Chemicals ensures that other BASF segments are supplied with chemicals for producing downstream products. The Chemicals segment comprises the Petrochemicals, Monomers and Intermediates divisions.
The Performance Products segment consists of the Dispersions & Pigments, Care Chemicals, Nutrition & Health and Performance Chemicals divisions. Customized products and solutions allow customers to make their production p rocesses more efficient or to give their products improved application properties. As of January 1, 2017, the activities of the Monomers and Dispersions & Pigments divisions for the Electronic Industry will be merged in the global business unit Electronic Materials in the Dispersions & Pigments division within the Performance Products segment. BASF thereby strengthens its position as a strategic partner for the large electronic producers.
The Functional Materials & Solutions segment bundles system solutions, services and innovative products for specific sectors and customers, especially the automotive, electrical, chemical and construction industries, as well as applications for household, sports and leisure. It is made up of the Catalysts, Construction Chemicals, Coatings, and Performance Materials divisions.
The Agricultural Solutions segment includes the Crop Protection division. It provides innovative solutions in the areas of chemical and biological crop protection, seed treatment and water management as well as for nutrient supply and plant stress. Plant biotechn ology research is not assigned to this segment; it is reported in Other.

The Oil & Gas segment comprises the division of the same name. As part of an asset swap at the end of the third quarter of 2015, BASF transferred to Gazprom the natural gas trading and storage business previously operated together with G azprom. Since October 1, 2015, the segment has concentrated on the exploration and production of oil and gas-rich regions in Europe, North Africa, Russia, South America and the Middle East as well as on the transport of natural gas together with partner Gazprom.
Activities not assigned to a particular division are reported under Other. These include the sale of raw materials, engineering and other services, rental income and leases, the production of precursors not assigned to a particular segment, the steering of the BASF Group by corporate headquarters, and cross-divisional corporate research. Cross-divisional c orporate research, which has been restructured in the context of the newly developed innovation approach, works on longterm topics of strategic importance to the BASF Group. Furthermore, it focuses on the development of specific key technologies, which are of central importance for the divisions. Plant biotechnology research is also part of cross-divisional corporate research.
Earnings from currency conversion that are not allocated to the segments are also reported under Other, as are earnings from the hedging of raw material prices and foreign currency exchange risks. Furthermore, income and expenses from the long-term incentive (LTI) program are shown here.
Transfers between the segments are generally executed at adjusted market-based prices which take into account the higher cost efficiency and lower risk of Group-internal transactions. Assets, as well as their depreciation and amortization, are allocated to the segments based on economic control. Assets used by more than one segment are allocated based on the percentage of usage.

The line item foreign currency results, hedging and other measurement effects decreased by 111 million to minus 331 million. Higher additions to provisions in comparison with the previous year for the long-term incentive (LTI) program were partially compensated by lower currency losses. The costs for

cross-divisional corporate research as well as costs of corporate headquarters decreased by 7 million and 11 million, respectively. The line item miscellaneous income and expenses amounted to minus 182 million compared with minus 300 million in the previous year, which included expenses for BASF's 150th anniversary celebrations among other things.

The reconciliation reporting Oil & Gas reconciles the income from operations in the Oil & Gas segment with the contribution of the segment to the net income of the BASF Group.
Income from operations in 2016 declined significantly in comparison with the previous year. This was essentially a result of lower oil and gas prices in the first three quarters of 2016 compared with the same period of the previous year as well as the asset swap with Gazprom on September 30, 2015. This resulted in a lack of earnings contributions from the d ivested gas trading and storage business and the 50% share in Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Furthermore, the transaction led to earnings of 314 million in the previous year. The share in the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field contributed lower

income from operations, as the excess amounts received over the last ten years were compensated in 2016, as contractually agreed with our partner, Gazprom.
Impairments for exploration and production licenses in the Oil & Gas segment dampened income from operations by 609 million in 2015.

The Oil & Gas segment's other income relates to income and expenses not included in the segment's income from operations, interest result and other financial result. As in the previous year, other income largely consisted of currency effects from Group loans.

Positive income taxes in 2016 were primarily a result of the calculation of taxable income in Norway.

1 The sum of sales including interregional transfers for all the regions can differ from the sum of sales including intersegmental transfers for all the segments, as the segments are viewed globally, and therefore shipments and services between regions within the same segment are not classified as transfers.

In the United States, sales to third parties in 2016 amounted to 12,831 million (2015: 13,831 million) according to location of companies and 11,985 million (2015: 13,302 million) according to location of customers. In the United States,

intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to 10,342 million compared with 9,262 million in the previous year.

In accordance with IAS 33, a potential dilutive effect must be considered in the diluted earnings per share for those BASF shares which will be granted in the future as a part of the BASF share program "plus." This applies regardless of the fact that the necessary shares are acquired by third parties on the market on behalf of BASF, and the fact that there are no plans for the issuance of new shares. The dilutive effect of the issue of "plus" shares amounted to 0.01 in 2016 (2015: 0.01).

6 Functional costs

Under the cost-of-sales method, functional costs incurred by the operating functions are determined on the basis of cost center accounting. The functional costs particularly contain the personnel costs, depreciation and amortization accumulated on the underlying final cost centers as well as allocated costs within the cost accounting cycle. Operating expenses that cannot be allocated to the functional costs are reported as other operating expenses.
For more on other operating expenses, see Note 8 from page 183 onward
Cost of sales

Selling expenses
Selling expenses particularly include marketing and advertising costs, freight costs, packaging costs, distribution management costs, commissions, and licensing costs.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of the central units, the costs of managing business units and divisions, and costs of general management, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board.

Cost of sales includes all production and purchase costs of the company's own products as well as merchandise which has been sold in the period, particularly plant, energy and personnel costs.

Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses include the costs resulting from research projects as well as the necessary license fees for research activities.
For more on research and development expenses by segment, see Note 4 on page 180

Income from the adjustment and reversal of provisions that had been recognized in other operating expenses was largely related to closures and restructuring measures, e mployee obligations, risks from lawsuits and damage claims, and various other items as part of the normal course of b usiness. Provisions were reversed or adjusted if the circumstances on the balance sheet date were such that utilization was no longer expected, or expected to a lesser extent.
For more information, see Note 8 from page 183 onward
Revenue from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities primarily included income from rentals, catering o perations, cultural events and logistics services.
Income from foreign currency and hedging trans actions pertained to the foreign currency translation of receivables and payables as well as of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions. The decline compared with the previous year was attributable to the cessation of crude oil swaps to hedge price risks from gas purchase and sales contracts due to the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom.

Income from the translation of financial statements in foreign currencies contained gains from the translation of companies whose local currency is different from the functional currency.
Gains on divestitures and the disposal of fixed assets in the amount of 349 million resulted from the sale of the industrial coatings business to AkzoNobel, Amsterdam, N etherlands. Income of 93 million arose from the sale of the global polyolefin catalysts business to W.R. Grace & Co., C olumbia, Maryland. Further income of 83 million resulted from the disposal of BASF's OLED intellectual property assets to UDC Ireland Limited, Dublin, Ireland. Income of 72 million pertained to real estate divestitures in several countries. The previous year had particularly contained income in the amount of 314 million from the asset swap with Gazprom. In addition, the sale of the global textile chemicals business to Archroma Textiles S.à r.l., Luxembourg, resulted in income of 71 million. Additional income of 39 million was attributable to the sale of the white expandable polystyrene (EPS) business to Alpek S.A.B. de C.V., Monterrey, Mexico. Furthermore, income in the

BASF Report 2016

Consolidated Financial S tatements 183
Notes -- Notes on statement of income

amount of 37 million arose from the sale of buildings in China and India as well as income in the amount of 29 million from the sale of the custom synthesis business and parts of the active pharmaceutical ingredients portfolio to Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland.
Income from the reversal of valuation allowances for business-related receivables resulted mainly from the settlement of customer-related receivables for which a valuation allowance had been recorded.
Income under Other included government grants and government assistance from several countries amounting to 156 million in 2016 and 135 million in 2015. In both years, these were primarily attributable to price compensation from the Argentinian government for gas producers, which was introduced in connection with the New Gas Price Scheme (NGPS) in response to the lower, partly locally regulated gas prices.

Further income resulted from refunds and compensation payments in the amount of 291 million in 2016 and 254 million in 2015. These were predominantly due in both years to insurance refunds arising from a plant outage at the Ellba C.V. joint operation in Moerdijk, Netherlands. The previous year had also included income from a one-off payment for a price revision relating to 2014 in the Oil & Gas segment as well as a one-off payment from Tellus Petroleum AS, Oslo, Norway, in connection with the intended sale of selected assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, which was not completed.
Moreover, income in both years was related to gains from precious metal trading, the reversal of impairments on p roperty, plant and equipment, tax refunds, income from the adjustment of pension plans, and a number of additional items.

Expenses for restructuring measures were primarily related to severance payments amounting to 190 million in 2016 and 69 million in 2015. Further expenses for restructuring measures arose in the Petrochemicals division at several sites in the United States; these amounted to 37 million in 2016 and 15 million in 2015. In the Dispersions & Pigments d ivision, expenses of 25 million in 2016 and 16 million in 2015 concerned several sites worldwide. In addition, e xpenses of 39 million in 2016 and 15 million in 2015 were incurred for the outsourcing of the computer centers as well as for a regional restructuring project in South America.
Expenses arose from environmental protection and safety measures, demolition and removal, and planning expenses related to capital expenditures insofar as these are not subject to mandatory capitalization according to IFRS. Expenses for demolition, removal and project planning totaled 375 million in 2016 and 376 million in 2015. These e specially pertained to the Ludwigshafen site in both years.

Further expenses of 61 million in 2016 and 37 million in 2015 arose from the addition to environmental provisions. In both years, these concerned several discontinued sites in North America. In 2016, expenses were also incurred for landfills in Germany. Moreover, the previous year had contained expenses for several discontinued sites in Switzerland.
Amortization, depreciation and impairments of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment arose from impairments in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment in the amount of 124 million in 2016 compared with 57 million in 2015. The Chemicals segment posted impairments of 67 million in 2016 and 18 million in 2015. Further impairments of 24 million concerned the Agricultural Solutions segment in 2016. The previous year had recorded 500 million in impairments in the Oil & Gas segment and 53 million in the Performance Products segment.

Expenses from foreign-currency and hedging transactions as well as from the measurement of LTI options were related to foreign currency translations of receivables and payables as well as changes in the fair value of currency d erivatives and other hedging transactions. Compared with the previous year, lower expenses were particularly the result of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against various currencies. Countering this was an additional expense in 2016 for the long-term incentive (LTI) program of 267 million (2015: 53 million).
Losses from the disposal of fixed assets and divestitures amounted to 17 million in 2016 from the reduction in disposal gains from the asset swap with Gazprom as part of the final purchase price allocation. In 2015, losses mainly stemmed from the sale of the global paper hydrous kaolin business to Imerys Kaolin, Inc., Roswell, Georgia.

Expenses from the addition of valuation allowances for business-related receivables rose by 25 million compared with the previous year. This was predominantly due to higher additions in the region South America, Africa, Middle East as compared with the prior year.
In both years, expenses under Other included expenses from attorneys' fees for litigation cases as well as from REACH, the provision of services, and conducting additional projects. Moreover, 2016 contained expenses of 27 million from the fire damage at the Ludwigshafen North Harbor. In addition to expenses for onerous contracts at several companies, 2015 also contained expenses of 121 million for BASF's 150th anniversary.

Income from companies accounted for using the equity method increased in 2016 primarily due to higher earnings of BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China. Countering this were lower earnings at Lucura Versicherungs AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany, which was largely attributable to building of provisions in connection with the fire at the North Harbor in October 2016.

In 2016, earnings from companies in the Oil and Gas segment which are accounted for using the equity method remained at the prior year level. Nord Stream AG, Zug, Switzerland, OAO Severneftegazprom, Krasnoselkup, Russia, as well as GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, con tributed most to these earnings.

Net income from shareholdings was 26 million lower in 2016 than in the previous year. In 2015, higher income from the disposal of shareholdings was reported, particularly from the disposal of the share in Indaver N.V., Antwerp, Belgium.
The interest result declined by 57 million compared with the previous year from minus 425 million to minus 482 million. This was due to lower interest income particularly from liquid funds and higher interest expenses arising from bank loans outside of the eurozone.
Net interest expenses of the respective financial year is based on the discount rate and the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The net interest expense from

underfunded pension plans and similar obligations decreased compared with the previous year, as a result of the reduced net defined benefit liability as of December 31, 2015.
In comparison with 2015, income from the capitalization of borrowing costs declined due to the start up of larger investment projects.
The rise in other financial expenses was largely attributable to hedging of loans in U.S. dollars.

11 Income taxes

In Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon is levied on all paid out and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax that varies depending on the municipality in which the company is represented. Due to a constant rate of assessment for Ludwigshafen, Germany, in 2016, the weighted

average trade tax rate was 14.1% (2015: 14.1%). The 30% rate used to calculate deferred taxes for German Group companies remained unchanged in 2016. The profits of foreign Group companies are assessed using the tax rates applicable in their respective countries. These are also generally used to calculate deferred taxes to the extent that tax rate adjustments for the future have not yet been enacted.

The BASF Group tax rate amounted to 21.1% in 2016 (2015: 22.5%). The lower tax rate was mainly due to deferred tax income arising from the valuation of the differences to the tax values as a result of foreign currency translation. Taxes for prior years primarily contained reversals of long-term tax provisions.
The foreign tax-rate differential increased due to improvement in earnings in the Exploration & Production business sector in countries with a high tax rate, particularly in Norway. In the previous year, nondeductible expenses particularly

included an impairment of the goodwill of the Exploration & Production business sector. In Other, currency driven valuation of the differences to the tax values as well as a dditional tax depreciation on oil and gas production facilities in Norway led to tax income.
Future reversals of temporary differences for shares in investments that are assumed to have a planning horizon of one year led to deferred tax income of 2 million in 2016 (2015: 28 million).

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax balances and the measurement of assets and liabilities according to IFRS as well as from tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. The remeasurement of all the assets and liabilities associated with acquisitions according to IFRS 3 has resulted in significant deviations between fair values and the values in the tax accounts. This leads primarily to deferred tax liabilities.
Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries resulted in temporary differences of 8,905 million in 2016 (2015: 9,241 million) for which deferred tax liabilities were not recognized, as they are either not subject to taxation on payout or they are e xpected to be reinvested for indefinite periods of time.
Tax loss carryforwards

Tax loss carryforwards exist in all regions, especially in Europe and Asia. German tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. In foreign countries, tax loss carryforwards are in some cases only possible for a limited period of time. The bulk of the tax loss carryforwards will expire in Europe by 2019 and in Asia by 2021. No deferred tax assets were recognized for tax loss carryforwards of 1,478 million in 2016 (2015: 1,767 million).
Tax obligations
Tax obligations primarily include assessed income taxes and other taxes as well as estimated income taxes not yet assessed for the current year. Tax obligations amounted to 1,288 million in 2016 (2015: 1,082 million).

In 2016, lower minority interests in profits in comparison with the previous year were mainly the result of the disposal of shares in companies active in the gas storage business in connection with the asset swap completed with Gazprom on September 30, 2015. Also responsible were decreased margins and lower sales volumes from the reduced capacity utilization of BASF TOTAL Petrochemicals LLC's condensate splitter in Port Arthur, Texas.

Higher minority interests in profits compared with the previous year were predominantly attributable to W & G Transport Holding GmbH, Kassel, Germany, and Shanghai BASF Polyurethane Company Ltd., Shanghai, China.

The BASF Group spent 10,165 million for wages and salaries, social security contributions and expenses for p ensions and assistance in 2016 (2015: 9,982 million). This represented an increase in personnel expenses of 1.8%. This was particularly due to higher expenses for the long-term incentive (LTI) program in addition to wage and salary increases. Countering this was the lower average number of employees (2016: 111,975 employees; 2015: 113,249 employ ees) as well as currency effects.

14 Intangible assets

The goodwill of BASF is allocated to 22 cash-generating units (2015: 21), which are defined either on the basis of business units or on a higher level.
Annual impairment testing took place in the fourth quarter of the year on the basis of the cash-generating units. Recoverable amounts were determined in most cases using the value in use. This was done using plans approved by company management and their respective cash flows, generally for the next five years. Thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection from the last detailed planning year as a perpetual annuity. The planning is based on experience, current performance and management's best possible estimates on the future development of individual parameters, such as raw material prices and profit margins. The oil price is also among the main input parameters that provide the basis for the forecast of cash flows in the current financial plans. Market assumptions regarding, for example, economic development and market growth are included based on external macroeconomic sources as well as sources specific to the industry.
The weighted average cost of capital rate after tax required for impairment testing is determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. It comprises a risk-free rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The calculation also takes into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash- generating unit. Impairment tests of the units (excluding Exploration & Production in the Oil & Gas segment) were conducted assuming a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes between 5.07% and 8.01% (2015: between 6.04% and 7.67%). This represents a weighted average cost of c apital rate before taxes between 6.43% and 10.77% (2015: between 7.77% and 10.81%). In the financial year 2016, a refined valuation model based on a field-related valuation approach was introduced, which considers the expected cash flows as well as the tax payments in the individual countries. The period under consideration now includes the planned license terms and the production profiles of the included oil and gas fields. Furthermore, instead of using a single weighted average cost of capital rate, the country risk and the specific tax rate is considered in each case: this leads to a more precise calculation of the recoverable amount. Con sidering these parameters, the capital rate after taxes varied b etween 7.5% and 13.76% and before taxes between 10.96% and 37.68%.

In determining the recoverable amount for the great majority of cash-generating units, BASF generally anticipates that a reasonably possible deviation from the key assumptions will not lead to the carrying amount of the units exceeding their respective recoverable amounts. For the goodwill of the Construction Chemicals division and the cash-generating units Pigments (in the Dispersions & Pigments division), as well as Catalysts (excluding battery materials), this is not the case.
In the 2016 business year, the recoverable amount of the Construction Chemicals unit exceeded the carrying amount by around 282 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes used for impairment testing was 8.01% (2015: 7.67%). The recoverable amount would equal the unit's carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rate increased by 0.69 percentage points (2015: by 0.96 percentage points) or if income from operations of the last detailed planning year ­ as the basis for the terminal value ­ were lower by 12.0% (2015: by 16.65%).
In 2016, the recoverable amount of Pigments exceeded the carrying amount by 242 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes used for impairment testing was 5.09% (2015: 6.07%). The recoverable amount would equal the unit's carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rate increased by 0.51 percentage points (2015: by 0.04 percentage points) or if income from operations of the last detailed planning year ­ as the basis for the terminal value ­ were lower by 13.78% (2015: by 0.92%).
In 2016, the recoverable amount of Catalysts (excluding battery materials) exceeded the carrying amount by 705 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes used for the impairment testing of this unit was 8.01% (2015: 7.66%). The recoverable amount would equal the unit's carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rate increased by 0.82 percentage points (2015: by 0.73 percentage points) or if income from operations of the last detailed planning year ­ as the basis for the terminal value ­ were lower by 13.75% (2015: by 14.52%).
For impairment testing in the Exploration & Production business sector in the Oil & Gas segment, BASF assumes an average oil price of $55 per barrel of Brent crude oil in 2017. In comparison with the previous year, the long-term outlook for oil prices remained unchanged. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit Exploration & Production improved significantly compared against the impairment test of the previous year. This was mainly due to the expenditure and production profiles that were adapted to the price development.

Besides goodwill, intangible assets also include acquired intangible assets as well as internally generated intangible a ssets. In addition, they include rights belonging to the Oil & Gas segment, which are amortized in accordance with the unit of production method. As of December 31, 2016, their acquisition costs amounted to 1,029 million and accumulated amortization to 328 million; amortization in 2016 amounted to 19 million.

Additions from acquisitions amounted to 2,789 million in 2016. Significant acquisitions comprising the purchase of the global surface treatment provider Chemetall from Albemarle Corp., Charlotte, North Carolina, and the automotive refinishing business from Guangdong Yinfan Chemistry, Jiangmen, China, led to an increase of goodwill in the amount of 1,552 million. In connection with these transactions, additions to intangible assets amounted to 1,237 million. These were primarily related to customer relationships and production technologies.

BASF Report 2016

Consolidated Financial S tatements 191
Notes -- Notes on balance sheet

Disposals of intangible assets in the amount of 21 million were largely attributable to the sale of the 25% share in the Byrding field to Statoil and the divestiture of the global p hotoinitiator business as well as the global polyolefin c atalysts business. Related to this, goodwill of 64 million was derecognized.
Concessions for oil and gas production under the category product rights, licenses and trademarks with a net carrying amount of 466 million in 2016 authorize the exploration and

production of oil and gas in certain areas. At the end of the term of a concession, the rights are returned.
In 2016, additions to accumulated amortization included impairments of 61 million. This primarily affected impairments relating to production technologies and marketing and selling rights in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment in the amount of 51 million.

Besides goodwill, intangible assets also include acquired intangible assets as well as internally generated intangible a ssets. In addition, they include rights belonging to the Oil & Gas segment, which are amortized in accordance with the unit of production method. As of December 31, 2015, their a cquisition costs amounted to 835 million and accumulated amortization to 246 million; amortization in 2015 amounted to 41 million.
Additions from acquisitions amounted to 136 million in 2015. Significant acquisitions concerned the purchase of a 66% share in a company to which TODA KOGYO CORP., Hiroshima, Japan, contributed its business, and the purchase of the polyurethane (PU) business from Polioles, S.A. de C.V., Lerma, Mexico. In connection with these transactions, additions to intangible assets amounted to 87 million. Moreover, BASF concluded an agreement with Lanxess on the acqui sition and use of technologies and patents for the production

of high-molecular-weight polyisobutene (HM PIB), which a dded 23 million to intangible assets.
Concessions for oil and gas production under the category product rights, licenses and trademarks with a net carrying amount of 480 million in 2015 authorize the exploration and production of oil and gas in certain areas. At the end of the term of a concession, the rights are returned. Aside from transfers to property, plant and equipment, transfers in 2015 included 54 million from the subsequent adjustments of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of assets from Statoil.
Other rights and values under transfers also included derecognitions of 153 million resulting from the change in accounting to the net method for emission right certificates granted free of charge in 2015. Disposals of 17 million were attributable to the asset swap with Gazprom.

Related to this, goodwill of 173 million was derecognized, 32 million of which was reported under transfers.
In 2015, additions to accumulated amortization included impairments of 205 million. These primarily concerned the Oil & Gas segment. The revised assumptions for oil and gas prices led to 137 million in goodwill impairments as well as 27 million in impairments on a license in Norway. Further-

more, under the category know-how, patents and production technologies, a once-advantageous supply contract of 36 million in the Functional Materials & Solutions segment was fully impaired due to lower market prices.
In 2015, additions to accumulated amortization included write-ups of 2 million.

Additions to property, plant and equipment arising from investment projects amounted to 4,222 million in 2016. M aterial investments were primarily related to the construction of an integrated aroma ingredients complex in Kuantan, Malaysia, the TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and the expansion of the dicamba plant in Beaumont, Texas, which were partially started up in 2016. Further material asset additions included the construction of an a mmonia plant in Freeport, Texas, and oil and gas production facilities and wells in Europe and South America.
In addition, investments for expansion purposes were particularly made at the sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Geismar, Louisiana; Port Arthur, Texas; and Antwerp, Belgium.
Government grants of 1 million were deducted from asset additions.

Due to acquisitions, property, plant and equipment rose by 155 million primarily from the acquisition of the global surface treatment provider Chemetall from Albemarle Corp., Charlotte, North Carolina.
In 2016, impairments of 254 million were included in accumulated depreciation. These pertained largely to impairments of 133 million on machinery and technical equipment as well as buildings due to the new strategic direction of individual businesses in the Chemicals and F unctional Materials & Solutions segments. The recoverable amount of these assets equals their value in use amounting to 72 million. The weighted a verage cost of capital rate before taxes applied ranged between 9.4% and 12.8%.

BASF Report 2016

In 2016, additions to accumulated depreciation contained write-ups of 2 million.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment were largely attributable to the sale of assets of the global polyolefin catalysts business to W. R. Grace & Co., Columbia, Maryland; the sale of the worldwide photoinitiator business to IGM Resins B.V., Waalwijk, the Netherlands; the sale of the 25% share

in the Byrding field to Statoil; and the sale of industrial coatings business to the AkzoNobel Group.
Currency effects arose particularly from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar as well as the Brazilian real relative to the euro.

Additions to property, plant and equipment arising from investment projects amounted to 5,651 million in 2015. Significant investments were primarily related to the construction of a TDI complex in Ludwigshafen, Germany; a production complex for acrylic acid and superabsorbents in Camaçari, Brazil; and an MDI plant in Chongqing, China. Each of these started up either fully or partly in 2015. Further significant investments included the construction of an integrated aroma ingredients complex in Kuantan, Malaysia, and oil and gas production facilities and wells in Europe and South America. Investments for expansion purposes were particularly made at the sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Freeport, Texas; Geismar, Louisiana; and Antwerp, Belgium. Government grants of 10 million related to tangible assets were deducted. Due to acquisitions, property, plant and equipm ent rose by 91 million primarily from the acquisition of BASF TODA Battery Materials LLC, Tokyo, Japan.
In 2015, impairments of 485 million were included in a ccumulated depreciation. Of this amount, 336 million pertained to impairments on oil and gas fields in Norway, Libya and Germany in the Oil & Gas segment. These impairments arose particularly from the ongoing low oil and gas price levels and the resulting revision of planning assumptions. These fields were written down to their recoverable amount, totaling 1,338 million. The weighted average cost of capital rate

b efore taxes used ranged between 9.13% and 88.83%. The high cost of capital rates were due to the special income tax for the oil and gas industry in Norway. The recoverable amount for impaired property, plant and equipment equals their value in use. In 2015, additions to accumulated depreciation contained write-ups of 5 million.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment were primarily attributable to the asset swap with Gazprom and related primarily to the transferred natural gas trading and storage business. Furthermore, BASF's share in Wintershall Noord zee B.V., Rijswijk, Netherlands, was reduced to 50%. With this loss of control, the company was reclassified as an investment accounted for using the equity method. 50% of the property, plant and equipment was reported in disposals and the remaining 50% in transfers.
Currency effects arose particularly from the a ppreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro.

Additions of 152 million to investments accounted for using the equity method were primarily attributable to the joint venture Synvina C.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands, established with Avantium in 2016. Furthermore, additions included Chongqing Chemetall Surface Treatment Co., Ltd, Chongqing, China; and the Changchun Chemetall Chemicals Co. Ltd., Changchun, China. Both companies were acquired in con nection with the acquisition of Chemetall on December 14, 2016. The capital increase at Markor Meiou Chemical (Xinjiang) Co., Ltd., Korla, China, had an effect of 8 million on additions.
Disposals totaling 107 million in the previous year were primarily attributable to the sale of the 25% share in SolVin to our partner Solvay, effective July 1, 2015.
Transfers include dividend distributions and other comprehensive income of the companies as well as the net income of investments accounted for using the equity method. The previous year's figure was made up primarily of the first-time use of the equity method to account for Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rijswijk, the Netherlands. The company is operated

together by BASF and Gazprom since the sale of BASF's 50% share to Gazprom in September 2015. Wintershall Noordzee B.V. is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method in the Consolidated Financial S tatements since then. In 2016, the final purchase price allocation resulted in an adjustment of the fair value of Wintershall Noordzee B.V. in the amount of minus 15 million, which is included in transfers.
For a detailed overview of income from companies accounted for using the equity method, see Note 9 on page 184
The change in other shareholdings resulted from additions of 107 million, primarily attributable to Gullfaks AS, Stavanger, Norway, and disposals of 12 million. Impairments amounted to 41 million. Other shareholdings decreased by 12 million as a result of reclassifications and transfers. Currency effects resulted in an increase of 6 million in other shareholdings.

A write-down of inventory was recognized in the amount of 43 million in 2016 and a write-up in the amount of 22 million in 2015. Changes in valuation allowances on inventory were largely due to lower net realizable value.

Of total inventories, 836 million was measured at net realizable value in 2016 and 770 million in 2015.

The decline in noncurrent loans and interest receivables in 2016 was predominantly due to the reduction of loans granted by WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG, Kassel, G ermany, to NEL Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, and GASCADE Gastransport GmbH, Kassel, Germany, by 139 million to 259 million to finance the pipeline network. Furthermore, loans granted by BASF Belgium Coordination Center Comm. V., Antwerp, Belgium, mainly to finance the business expansion of Asian companies, were reduced by 72 million to 144 million in 2016. As in the previous year, this item also included receivables in favor of BASF SE from the BASF Pensionskasse arising from an agreement regarding the granting of profit participation capital in the amount of 80 million.
The reduction of noncurrent derivatives positive fair market values primarily affected the market valuation of combined interest rate and currency swaps. The change in current derivatives with positive fair market values was largely attribut-

able to the lower fair values of precious metal and foreign currency derivatives.
Prepaid expenses in 2016 included prepayments of 64 million related to operating activities compared with 41 million in 2015, as well as 54 million in prepayments for insurance in 2016 compared with 30 million in 2015. Prepayments for license costs increased from 36 million to 48 million in 2016.
The reduction in current tax refund claims can largely be traced back to the settlement of open tax income receivables.
Precious metal trading items primarily comprise physical items and precious metal accounts as well as long positions in precious metals, which are largely hedged through sales or derivatives.

Changes recognized in income contained individual valuation allowances, group-wise individual valuation allowances and valuation allowances due to transfer risks.
Changes not recognized in income were primarily related to changes in the scope of consolidation, translation adjustments and derecognition of uncollectible receivables.
Even in the current economic environment, BASF has not observed any material changes in the credit quality of its receivables. In 2016, individual valuation allowances of 71 million were recognized for accounts receivable, trade, and valuation allowances of 22 million were reversed. In 2015, individual valuation allowances of 57 million were recognized for trade accounts receivable and valuation allowances of 17 million were reversed.

At BASF, a comprehensive, global credit insurance program covers trade accounts receivable incurred since January 1, 2015. As part of a global excess of loss policy, an essential part of future bad debts of the BASF Group are insured. No compensation claims were incurred in either 2016 or 2015.
In 2016, individual valuation allowances of 27 million were recognized for other receivables and 1 million reversed. In 2015, individual valuation allowances of 18 million were recognized for other receivables.

Authorized capital

Reserves and retained earnings

At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 2, 2014, shareholders authorized the Board of Executive Directors, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the subscribed capital by issuing new registered shares up to a total of 500 million against cash or contributions in kind through May 1, 2019. The Board of Executive Directors is empowered, following the approval of the Supervisory Board, to decide on the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights for these new shares in certain predefined cases covered by the enabling resolution. Until now, this option has not been e xercised and no new shares have been issued.
BASF SE has only issued fully paid-up registered shares with no par value. There are no preferences or other restrictions. BASF SE does not hold any treasury shares.

Capital surplus includes effects from BASF's share program, premiums from capital increases and consideration for w arrants and negative goodwill from the capital consolidation resulting from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the issue of BASF SE shares at par value.

Transfers from other retained earnings increased legal reserves by 31 million in 2016 (2015: 60 million).
Due to the disposal of the 25% share in SolVin to our partner, Solvay, of parts of the pharmaceutical ingredient b usiness to Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland, and the asset swap with Gazprom, an amount of 68 million resulting from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans was transferred from other comprehensive income into retained earnings in 2015. There were no transfers in 2016.
The acquisition of shares in companies which BASF a lready controls or which are included as a joint arrangement in the Consolidated Financial Statements is treated as a transaction between shareholders, as long as this does not

lead to a change in the consolidation method. There were no transactions of this type in 2016, as in the previous year.
Payment of dividends
In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2016, BASF SE paid a dividend of 2.90 per share from the retained profit of the 2015 fiscal year. With 918,478,694 shares entitled to dividends, this amounts to a total dividend payout of 2,663,588,212.60.

20 Other comprehensive income

Translation adjustments
The decline in the value of the euro, especially relative to the ruble and the U.S. dollar, in 2016 led to an increase of 824 million in the translation adjustment to 1,476 million.
Cash flow hedges
Hedging future cash flows at Nord Stream AG, Zug, Switzerland, a company accounted for using the equity method, resulted in a change of minus 7 million in 2016 and of 16 million in 2015.
The significant decline in the hedging of future cash flows in 2015 was primarily a result of the disposal of the negative fair values of commodity derivatives at WINGAS GmbH,

Kassel, Germany, in connection with the asset swap with Gazprom.
For more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note 27.4 from page 213 onward
Remeasurement of defined benefit plans
Due to the disposal of the 25% share in SolVin to its partner, Solvay, of parts of the pharmaceutical ingredient business to Siegfried Holding AG, Zofingen, Switzerland, and the asset swap with Gazprom, an amount of 68 million resulting from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans was transferred from other comprehensive income into retained earnings in 2015.

22 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations

In addition to state pension plans, most employees are granted company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Benefits generally depend on years of service, contributions or compensation, and take into consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security laws of the countries where the companies are located. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, employees have been almost exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service in recent years.
The Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all pension plans of the Group. In this connection, it issues g uidelines regarding the governance and risk management of pension plans, particularly with regard to the funding of the pension plans and the portfolio structure of the existing plan assets. The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and reporting requirements are documented for the units involved.
Economic and legal environment of the plans
In some countries ­ especially in Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium ­ there are pension obligations subject to government supervision or similar legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements to cover pension obligations, which are based on actuarial assumptions that may differ from those in IAS 19. Furthermore, there are restrictions in qualitative and quantitative terms relating to parts of the plan assets for the investment in certain asset categories. This could result in fluctuating employer contributions, financing requirements and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with the regulatory requirements.
The obligations and the plan assets used to fund the o bligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen d evelopments on commodity and capital markets. They affect, for example, pension adjustments based on the level of inflation in Germany and in the United Kingdom, as well as the impact of the discount rate on the amount of the defined benefit obligation. In previous years, measures taken to close plans with defined benefits for future service, especially benefits based on final pay promises and the assumption of healthcare costs for former employees, however, led to a reduction in risk with regard to future benefit levels.
The strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension commitments is aligned with country-specific supervisory and tax regulations.

Description of the defined benefit plans
Germany Description of the defined benefit plans Germany for BASF SE and German Group companies, a basic level of benefits is provided by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG, a legally independent funded plan, which is financed by contributions of employees and the employer as well as the return on plan assets. BASF SE ensures the necessary contributions to adequately finance the benefits promised by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via the BASF Pensions kasse VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the regulations imposed by the German supervisory authority. In 2004, the basic benefits plan at BASF was closed for newly hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a defined contribution plan. At BASF SE, occupational pension promises that exceed the basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual trust arrangement by BASF Pensions treuhand e.V.; at German Group companies, these benefits are almost exclusively financed via pension provisions. The benefits are largely based on cash balance plans. Furthermore, employees are given the option of participating in various deferred compensation schemes.
United States Employees are granted benefits based on defined contribution plans.
Since 2010, the existing defined benefit plans were closed to further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and benefits earned in the past have been frozen. There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases.
The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary to meet the minimum funding level would be based on the results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA.
Additional similar obligations arise from plans which a ssume the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees and their dependents. Such plans are closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of the benefits for such plans is frozen.
Switzerland The employees of the BASF Group in Switzerland receive a company pension, which is financed through a pension fund by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on assets. The pension plan is accounted for as a defined benefit plan, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law according to the Swiss law "Berufliche Vorsorge (BVG)" is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately.

According to government regulations, the employer is o bligated to make contributions, so that the pension fund is able to grant minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The p ension fund is managed by a board, where employer and employees are equally represented, that steers and monitors the benefit plan and assets.
United Kingdom United Kingdom Employees are granted benefits based on a defined contribution plan.
A part of the workforce received benefit increases depending on service period in connection with a career average plan until December 31, 2015. The BASF Group maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed for further increases in benefit from future years of service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in the cost of living until the beginning of retirement are legally required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.

The financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit plans are administered by a trust company, whose Board of Trustees, according to the trustee agreement and law, represents the interests of the beneficiaries and ensures that the benefits can be paid in the future. The required funding is determined using technical valuations according to local regulations every three years.
Other countries In the case of subsidiaries in other countries, defined benefits are covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly by external insurance companies or pension funds.

Actuarial assumptions The valuation of the defined benefit obligation is largely based on the following assumptions:

The assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation as of December 31 are used in the following year to determine the expenses for pension plans.
A Group-wide, uniform procedure is used to determine the discount rates used for the valuation of material pension obligations of the BASF Group. Accordingly, the discount rates were derived from the yields on corporate bonds in the respective currency zones with an issuing volume of more than 100 million units of the respective currency with a minimum rating of AA­ up to AA+ from one of the three rating agencies: Fitch, Moody's, or Standard & Poor's.

The valuation of the defined benefit obligation is generally made using the most recent actuarial mortality tables as of December 31 of the respective business year, which in Germany and the United States are derived from the BASF Group population and were last updated for the pension obligations in Germany in 2015 and for the pension obligations in the United States in 2014.

An alternative valuation of the defined benefit obligation was conducted in order to determine how changes in the under lying assumptions would influence the amount of the defined benefit obligation. A linear extrapolation of these amounts

based on alternative changes in the assumptions as well as an addition of combined changes in the individual assumptions is not possible.

The net interest on the defined benefit liability is recognized in the financial result. This results from the difference between the interest cost of the defined benefit obligation and the standardized return on plan assets as well as the interest cost for the asset ceiling. The expected contribution payments and benefits paid over the course of the business year are c onsidered in the determination of net interest.

Net interest expense of the respective business year is based on the discount rate and the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The net interest expense from underfunded pension plans and similar obligations decreased compared with the previous year, as a result of the reduced net defined benefit liability as of December 31, 2015.

Explanations regarding plan assets

The target asset allocation has been defined by using asset liability studies and is reviewed regularly. Accordingly, plan assets are aligned with the long-term development of the o bligations, taking into consideration the risks associated with the specific asset classes and the regulations relating to the investment of plan assets. The existing portfolio structure is oriented towards the target asset allocation. In addition, c urrent market assessments are taken into consideration. In order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a widely spread global portfolio of individual asset classes is held.
Liability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as h edging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used in some pension plans, especially in the U.K. and U.S. plans.

The asset class debt instruments comprises promissory notes and debentures (Pfandbriefe) in addition to corporate and government bonds. Government bonds primarily concern bonds from those countries enjoying the highest credit ratings, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. Corporate bonds mainly comprise investment-

grade bonds, whereby particular high-yield bonds are also held to a limited extent. In connection with the ongoing m onitoring of default risk based on a given risk budget and on the continuous observation of the development of the creditworthiness of issuers, an adjustment of plan asset allocation to a revised market assessment may be made, if necessary. Alternative investments largely comprise investments in private equity, absolute return funds and senior secured loans.
Almost all of the equities are priced on active markets. The category debt instruments includes promissory notes and debentures (Pfandbriefe), which were acquired through private placements with a market value in the amount of 853 million as of December 31, 2016, and 1,072 million as of December 31, 2015. For such securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. The capital market compensates for this lack of fungibility with yield premiums depending on the maturity. With only a few exceptions, there is no active market for plan assets in real estate and alternative investments.
Plan assets contained securities issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of 16 million on December 31, 2016 and 11 million on December 31, 2015. The market value of the properties of legally independent pension funds rented to BASF Group companies amounted to 117 million on December 31, 2016, and 151 million on December 31, 2015.
Since 2010 there has been an agreement between BASF SE and BASF Pensionskasse about the granting of profit participation capital with a nominal value of 80 million, which is used to strengthen the financing of the BASF Pensionskasse. No material transactions beyond this took place between the legally independent pension funds and BASF Group companies in 2016.
The funding of the plans was as follows:

Restoration obligations primarily relate to the estimated costs for the filling of wells and the removal of production equipment after the end of production in the Oil & Gas segment.
Provisions for environmental protection and remediation costs cover expected costs for rehabilitating conta minated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination at existing production or storage sites and similar measures.
Provisions for employee obligations primarily include obligations for the granting of long-service bonuses and anniversary payments, variable compensation including a ssociated social security contributions, as well as provisions for early retirement programs for employees nearing r etirement. The increase was primarily attributable to higher accruals for the long-term Incentive (LTI) program.
For more information on provisions for the long-term incentive program, see Note 30 from page 216 onward
Obligations from sales and purchase contracts largely include obligations arising from rebates granted and other price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment, warranties and product liability, sales commissions, expected losses on contracts. The increase in provisions resulted from higher accruals for rebate programs.

The restructuring measures provisions include severance payments to departing employees as well as expected costs for site closures, including the costs for demolition and similar measures.
Provisions for litigation, damage claims, warranties and similar commitments contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant party, as well as o bligations under damage claims against BASF and fines.
Other largely includes noncurrent tax provisions. The following table shows the development of other p rovisions by category.

BASF provides unlimited guarantees, particularly to the Danish government as well as the state-owned company Nordsøfonden, as a precondition for the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons in the Danish concession area by the joint venture Wintershall Noordzee B.V., Rjswijk, the Netherlands.

Partially countering the possible 100% liability of BASF arising from these guarantees are the 50% guarantees of the joint- venture partner in favor of BASF. Drawing on these guarantees was not forseeable as of December 31, 2016.

26Risks from litigation and claims

In the arbitration proceedings initiated in May 2013, Metrogas S.A., Chile, claims damages valued in an amount of 227 million as a result of insufficient gas deliveries against Wintershall Energía S.A., Argentina (WIAR), Total Austral S.A., Argentina, and Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina. The defendants, as sellers, concluded a natural gas supply contract with Metrogas in 1997. WIAR's share of supply in the contract is 37.5%. After the resignation of the chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal in mid-2016, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) nominated a new Arbitral Tribunal that will be pursuing the arbitration proceedings during 2017. The defendants are of the opinion that Metrogas does not have any claim for damages
BASF Corporation has potential liability under the Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws for investigation and cleanup at certain sites. The Lower Passaic River Study Area (LPRSA) is one such site comprising the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River in New Jersey. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency selected a final remedy for the lower 8 miles of the River. BASF Corporation and more than 60 other companies (collectively, the Lower Passaic River Study Area Cooperating Parties Group or CPG) are conducting a remedial investigation / feasibility study (RI/FS) of the entire 17 miles of the River. A decision on the remedy for the upper portion of the River will be made following completion of the RI/FS.
In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York against BASF Metals Limited (BML) along with

other defendants, alleging violations of antitrust and commodities laws stemming from the price discovery process for platinum and palladium. BML, based in the United Kingdom, and the other defendants are accused of improper conduct concerning the calculation of the market prices of platinum and palladium. Four additional lawsuits were filed between November 2014 and March 2015. The lawsuits were consolidated, and a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint was eventually filed in July 2015. This Complaint also names as a defendant, among others, BASF Corporation. On September 21, 2015, defendants filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, and BML and BASF Corporation filed individual motions to dismiss. In addition, a pro se complaint with similar allegations was filed in the same court in September 2015. Motions to dismiss the pro se complaint have also been filed. Pre-trial discovery is stayed pending resolution of the motions to dismiss. In April 2015, BML received from the European Commission written requests for information regarding platinum and palladium trading BML provided responsive information to the European Commission most recently in the spring of 2016. Since then, BML has not received any requests for further information or follow up.
Furthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants in or parties to a variety of judicial, arbitrational or regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our current knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a material effect on the economic situation of BASF.

27 Supplementary information on financial instruments

27.1 Financial risks

Exposure and sensitivity by currency (million )

Market risks
Foreign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could lead to negative changes in the value of financial instruments and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing rate of financial receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities into the functional currency of the respective Group company. Foreign currency contracts in a variety of currencies are used to hedge foreign exchange risks from primary financial instruments and planned transactions.
The foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments which are exposed to currency risks. In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the respective following year are included, if they fall under the currency risk management system. Long and short positions in the same currency are offset against each other.
The sensitivity analysis is conducted by simulating a 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the other currencies. The effect on BASF's income before taxes and minority interests would have been minus 300 million as of December 31, 2016, and minus 340 million as of December 31, 2015. The effect from the items designated under hedge accounting would have increased the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE before income taxes by  24 million as of December 31, 2016 (2015: increase of 52 million). This only refers to transactions in U.S. dollars. The foreign currency risk exposure amounted to 2,113 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2,201 million as of December 31, 2015.

Due to the use of options to hedge currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is not a linear function of the assumed changes in exchange rates.
Interest rate risks: Interest rate risks result from changes in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the interest payments of variable-rate instruments. To hedge these risks, interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used. While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of BASF, they are not of material significance for BASF's operating activities.
The variable interest exposure, which also includes fixed rate bonds set to mature in the following year, amounted to minus 2,447 million (2015: minus 2,786 million). An increase in all relevant interest rates by one percentage point would have raised income before taxes and minority interests by 1 million as of December 31, 2016, and raised income b efore taxes and minority interests by 7 million as of December 31, 2015. The effect from the items designated under hedge accounting would have increased the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE before income taxes by 16 million as of December 31, 2016 (2015: increase of 20 million).

Commodity price risks: Some of BASF's divisions are e xposed to strong fluctuations in raw material prices. These result primarily from raw materials (for example, naphtha, propylene, benzene, lauric oils, cyclohexane, methanol, natural gas, butadiene, LPG condensate and ammonia) as well as from precious metals. BASF takes the following measures to reduce price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials: ­­BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge the risks from
the volatility of raw material prices. These are primarily options and swaps on crude oil, oil products and natural gas. ­­In order to secure margins, the Oil & Gas segment used commodity derivatives, primarily swaps on oil products, up to the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom in 2015. Risks to margins arise in volatile markets when purchase and sales contracts are priced differently. ­­The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and longterm purchase contracts with precious metal producers. It also buys precious metals on spot markets from a variety of business partners. The price risk from precious metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts, is hedged using derivative instruments. This is mainly done using forward contracts which are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the precious metals. ­­In the Crop Protection division, the sales prices of products are sometimes coupled to the price of certain agricultural commodities. To hedge the resulting risks, derivatives on agricultural commodities are concluded.

BASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity d erivatives and precious metals trading positions. Using the value-at-risk analysis, we continually quantify market risk and forecast the maximum possible loss within a given confidence interval over a defined period. The value-at-risk calculation is based on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of one day. The value-at-risk calculation for precious metals is based on a confidence interval of 99%. BASF uses the variance-covariance approach.
BASF uses value at risk as a supplement to other risk management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume- based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.

The exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and short positions of the respective commodity category.
For more information regarding financial risks and BASF's risk management, see the chapter "Opportunities and risks report" in the Management's Report from page 111 onward

In addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for trading on its own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring.
In connection with CO2 emissions trading, various types of CO2 certificates are purchased and sold using forward contracts. The goal of these transactions is to benefit from market price differences. These deals are settled by physical delivery. As of December 31, 2016 as well as of December 31, 2015, there were no deals outstanding.
By holding commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions, BASF is exposed to price risks. The valuation of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market prices could negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF.

Default and credit risk
Default and credit risks arise when counterparties do not fulfill their contractual obligations. BASF regularly analyzes the creditworthiness of each significant debtor and grants credit limits on the basis of this analysis. Due to the global activities and diversified customer s tructure of the BASF Group, there is no significant concentration of default risk. The carrying amount of all receivables, loans and interest-bearing securities plus the nominal value of other financial obligations subject to default risk represents the maximum default risk for BASF.
For more information on credit risks, see Note 18 from page 195 onward
Liquidity risks
BASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of the liquidity planning. BASF has ready access to sufficient liquid funds from our ongoing commercial paper program and confirmed lines of credit from banks.

27.2 Maturity analysis The interest and principal payments as well as other payments for derivative financial instruments are relevant for the presentation of the maturities of the contractual cash flows from financial liabilities. Future cash flows are not discounted here.
Derivatives are included using their net cash flows, provided they have a negative fair value and therefore represent a liability. Derivatives with positive fair values are assets and are therefore not considered.

Trade accounts payable are generally interest-free and due within one year. Therefore, the carrying amount of trade accounts payable equals the sum of future cash flows.

27.3Classes and categories of financial instruments
For trade accounts receivable, other receivables and miscellaneous assets, loans, cash and cash equivalents, as well as trade accounts payable and other liabilities, the carrying amount approximates the fair value. Shareholdings which are not traded on an active market and whose fair value could not be reliably determined are recognized at amortized cost and are reported under other financial assets.

The fair value of financial indebtedness is determined on the basis of interbank interest rates. The difference between carrying amounts and fair values results primarily from changes in market interest rates.

The table "Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities" shows the extent to which financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the balance sheet, as well as potential effects from the offsetting of instruments subject to a legally enforceable global netting agreement or similar agreement. For positive fair values of combined interest and cross- currency swaps, the respective counterparties provided cash collaterals in corresponding amounts to the outstanding fair values.
Deviations from the derivatives with positive fair values and derivatives with negative fair values reported in other receivables and other liabilities at the end of 2016 and 2015 arose from derivatives not subject to any netting agreements as well as embedded derivatives and are therefore not included in the table above.

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortization of discounts, the recognition and reversal of impairments, results from the translation of foreign currencies as well as interest, dividends and all other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line item financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. Net gains or net losses from available-for-sale financial assets contain income and expenses from writedowns/write-ups, interest, dividends and the reclassification of valuation effects from equity on the sale of the securities and shareholdings.

The decrease in net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortized cost primarily related to currency translation of financing-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which resulted in a translation gain in 2016 and a translation loss in 2015. Countering this was a net loss in 2016 from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or

loss. This development is primarily due to realized and unrealized results from derivatives to hedge the liabilities previously stated.

27.4Derivative instruments and hedge accounting
The use of derivative instruments
BASF is exposed to foreign-currency, interest-rate and commodity-price risks during the normal course of business. These risks are hedged through a centrally determined strategy employing derivative instruments. Hedging is only employed for underlying items from the operating business, cash investments, and financing as well as for planned sales, raw material purchases and capital measures. The risks from the underlying transactions and the derivatives are constantly monitored. Where derivatives have a positive market value, BASF is exposed to credit risks from derivative transactions in

the event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize the default risk on derivatives with positive market values, transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy banks and partners and are subject to predefined credit limits.
To ensure effective risk management, risk positions are centralized at BASF SE and certain Group companies. The contracting and execution of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal guidelines, and subject to strict control mechanisms.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using valuation models which use input parameters observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on market prices.

Cash flow hedge accounting
Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using swaps and options on oil and oil products. Some of these hedges were shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group by means of cash flow hedge accounting, where gains and losses from hedges were initially recognized directly in equity. Gains and losses from hedges are included in cost of sales at the point in time at which the hedged item is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Unlike the previous year, no hedging instruments were designated in 2016.
In the previous year up to the completion of the asset swap with Gazprom, cash flow hedge accounting was a pplied in the Natural Gas Trading business sector for crude oil swaps concluded in order to hedge price risks from purchase and sales contracts for natural gas. These contracts had variable p rices and the price formula was coupled with the oil price.
Cash flow hedge accounting continued to be applied to a minor extent for natural gas purchases.

The planned transactions and their effect on earnings occur in the year following the balance sheet date. In 2016, effective changes in the fair value of hedging instruments of 1 million (2015: 35 million) was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. In 2016, effective changes in the fair value of hedging instruments of 1 million were derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE and recognized in other operating income. In 2015, this resulted in an expense of 174 million. The ineffective part in the change in value of the hedge amounted to minus 1 million in 2016 and minus 2 million in 2015. This amount was reported in the income statement in other operating expenses and in the previous year in cost of sales as well as in other operating income and in other operating expenses.
BASF applied cash flow hedge accounting for derivatives used to hedge foreign currency risks from gas purchase and sales contracts to the completion of the asset swap with G azprom in 2015. In 2015 up to the completion date, the e ffective change in values of the hedges was minus 150 million, which was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. There were no ineffective parts. The amounts derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE increased cost of sales by 161 million to the completion date in 2015.

214 Consolidated Financial S tatements

BASF Report 2016

BASF also uses cash flow hedge accounting for some foreign currency derivatives to hedge planned sales d enominated in U.S. dollars. The impact on earnings from the underlying transactions will occur in 2017. In 2016, the e ffective change in values of the hedges was 9 million (2015: minus 23 million), which was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. A total of 11 million (2015: expense of 29 million) was derecognized from the equity of shareholders of BASF SE and was recognized in income from foreign currency and hedging transactions. The hedge was entirely effective.
To hedge foreign currency risk which existed for a part of the US dollar-denominated purchase price for the acquisition of Chemetall, BASF used options and foreign currency forward contracts in 2016. These were d esignated as hedging instruments and led to effective changes in the amount of 97 million, which was recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. Upon completion of the transaction in December 2016, this amount was derecognized from the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE reducing the purchase price accordingly and along with that the resulting goodwill arising from the transaction. The ineffective part of the fair value changes of the

hedging instruments amounted to minus 10 million and was recognized in other operating expenses.
The interest rate risk of the floating rate notes issued by BASF SE in 2014 (300 million variable-rate bond 2014/2017) as well as the floating rate notes issued in 2013 were hedged using interest rate swaps. The bonds and the interest rate swaps were designated in a hedging relationship. In 2016, the effective changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments amounting to 6 million (2015: 3 million) were recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE. There were no ineffective parts.
Furthermore, BASF SE's fixed-rate U.S. private placement of $1.25 billion, issued in 2013, was converted into euros u sing currency swaps. This hedge was designated as a cash flow hedge. The hedge was entirely effective. In 2016, this resulted in changes in fair value of minus 33 million, which were recognized in the equity of the shareholders of BASF SE (2015: 157 million). In 2016, 38 million was derecognized from other comprehensive income and recorded as income in the financial result (2015: 119 million income in financial result).

BASF Report 2016

Capital structure management

Currently, BASF has the following ratings:

The aim of capital structure management is to maintain the financial flexibility needed to further develop BASF's business portfolio and take advantage of strategic opportunities. The objectives of the Company's financing policy are to secure solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.
Capital structure management focuses on meeting the requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to capital markets and a solid A rating. BASF's capital structure is managed using selected financial ratios, such as dynamic debt ratios, as part of the company's financial planning.
As a part of risk management, activities in countries with transfer restrictions are continuously monitored. This includes, for example, regular analysis of the macroeconomic and legal environment, shareholders' equity and the business models of the operating units. The chief aim is the reduction of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group.
The equity of the BASF Group as reported in the balance sheet amounted to 32,568 million as of December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: 31,545 million); the equity ratio was 42.6% on December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: 44.5%).
BASF prefers to access external financing on the capital markets. A commercial paper program is used for short-term financing, while corporate bonds are used for financing in the medium and long term. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, achieve a diverse range of investors and optimize our debt capital financing conditions.

Rating agency Moody's last confirmed their rating of "A1/P-1/ outlook stable" on November 28, 2016. Standard & Poor's adjusted their BASF rating from "A+/A-1/outlook negative" to "A/A-1/outlook stable" on March 14, 2016, and confirmed it most recently on August 10, 2016. This a djustment was largely based on the weaker market environment, especially for basic and agricultural chemicals, limited overall volumes growth, and the considerable drop in the price of crude oil. Uncertainty with regard to economic development in China was taken into c onsideration, as well. Rating agency Scope has also been evaluating BASF's creditworthiness since September 2016. They rated BASF at "A/S-1/outlook stable."
BASF continues to strive for at least a solid A rating, which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets.

30 Share-price-based compensation program and BASF incentive share program

Share-price-based compensation program
In 2016, BASF continued its share-price-based compensation program known as the long-term incentive (LTI) program for senior executives of the BASF Group. This program has been in place since 1999. Approximately 1,200 senior executives, including the Board of Executive Directors, are currently e ntitled to participate in this program. This program provides for the granting of virtual options, which are settled in cash when exercised.
Participation in the LTI program is voluntary. In order to take part in the program, a participant must make a personal investment: A participant must hold BASF shares amounting to 10% to 30% of his or her individual variable compensation for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding period). The number of shares to be held is determined by the amount of variable compensation and the volume-weighted average market price for BASF shares on the first business day after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which was 69.93 on May 2, 2016.
The participant receives four option rights per invested share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B, which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met:

The threshold of right A is met if the price of the BASF share has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base price (absolute threshold). The value of right A will be the d ifference between the market price of BASF shares on the exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the base price. Right B may be exercised if the cumulative percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds (relative threshold) the percentage performance of the MSCI World Chemicals IndexSM (MSCI Chemicals). The value of right B will be the base price of the option multiplied by twice the percentage outperformance of BASF shares compared with the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited to the closing price on the date of exercise minus the computed nominal value of BASF shares. Beginning with the 2013 LTI program, right B is only valuable if the price of BASF shares at least corresponds with the base price. The options of the LTI program 2016 were granted on July 1, 2016, and may be exercised following a two-year vesting period, between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2024. During the exercise period, there are certain times (closed periods) during which the options may not be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full. This means that one of the performance targets must be surpassed. If the other performance target is

BASF Report 2016

Consolidated Financial S tatements 217
Notes -- Other explanatory notes

not surpassed and the option is exercised, the other option right lapses. A participant's maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to five times the original individual investment starting with the 2013 LTI program. The maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to ten times the original individual investment for programs from previous years. Option rights are nontransferable and are forfeited if the option h olders no longer work for BASF or have sold part of their individual investment before the expiry of the two-year vesting period. They remain valid in the case of retirement. For the members of the Board of Executive Directors, the long-term orientation of the program is significantly strengthened compared with the conditions applying to the other participants. The members of the Board of Executive Directors are required to participate in the LTI program with at least 10% of their gross bonus. In view of this binding personal investment (in the form of BASF shares), an extended holding period of four years applies. Members of the Board of Executive Directors may only exercise their options at least four years after they have been granted (vesting period).
The 2009 to 2015 programs were structured in a similar way to the LTI program 2016.
The models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined using the binomial model.

The stated fair values and the valuation parameters relate to the LTI programs 2016 and 2015. The fair value calculation was based on the assumption that options will be exercised in a manner dependent on their potential gains. For the programs from preceding years, corresponding fair values were com puted and valuation parameters were used.
Volatility was determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the options.
The number of options granted amounted to 1,710,404 in 2016 (2015: 1,807,532).
As a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive D irectors in 2002 to settle options in cash, options outstanding from the LTI programs 2009 to 2016 were valued with the fair value as of December 31, 2016. A proportionate provision is recorded for programs in the vesting period. The LTI provision

increased from 222 million as of December 31, 2015, to 464 million as of December 31, 2016, due to higher fair values of the outstanding option rights as well as due to a higher number of outstanding options. The utilization of provisions amounted to 25 million in 2016 (2015: 34 million). Expenses arising from additions to the provision amounted to 267 million in 2016. The previous year had included an expense of 49 million.
The total intrinsic value of the exercisable options amounted to 167 million as of December 31, 2016 and 34 million as of December 31, 2015.

BASF incentive share program

All employees are entitled to participate in the "plus" incentive share program, with the exception of those entitled to participate in the LTI program. The "plus" incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is currently offered in Germany, other European countries and Mexico. Each participant must make an individual investment in BASF shares from his or her variable compensation. For every ten BASF shares purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at no cost after one, three, five, seven and ten years of holding the BASF shares. As a rule, the first and second block of ten shares entitle the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next ten years.
The right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant stops working for the Company or one year after retirement. The number of free shares to be granted has developed as follows:

Number of free shares to be granted (shares)

As of January 1 Newly acquired entitlements Bonus shares issued Lapsed entitlements As of December 31

2016 2,829,521
637,610 (519,984)
(97,424) 2,849,723

2015 2,905,048
533,825 (509,168) (100,184) 2,829,521

The free shares to be provided by the Company are measured at the fair value on the grant date. Fair value is determined on the basis of the stock price of BASF shares, taking into account the present value of dividends, which are not paid during the term of the program. The weighted-average fair value on the grant date amounted to 67.90 for the 2016 program, and 71.55 for the 2015 program.
The fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in capital surplus over the term of the program.
Personnel expenses of 28 million were recorded in 2016 for the BASF incentive share program "plus" and 27 million in 2015.

Sales and trade accounts receivable from and trade accounts payable to related parties mainly included business with own products and merchandise, agency and licensing businesses, and other operating business.
Other receivables and liabilities primarily arose from financing activities, outstanding dividend payments, profitand-loss transfer agreements, and other finance-related and operating activities and events.
The decline of 127 million in other receivables from associated companies in 2016 was largely due to the repayment of long-term loans.
The outstanding balances toward related parties were generally not secured and settled in cash. As in the previous year, there were no significant valuation allowances in 2016 for trade accounts receivable from related parties. The balance of valuation allowances for other receivables from nonconsoli dated subsidiaries rose from 39 million as of December 31, 2015, to 79 million as of December 31, 2016. Thereof 26 million in 2016 was recognized as an expense (2015: 17 million).
There were obligations from guarantees and other financial obligations at BASF in favor of nonconsolidated subsidiaries in the amount of 3 million on December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: 45 million) and in favor of associated companies in the amount of 21 million in 2016 (December 31, 2015: 37 million).

Obligations arising from purchase contracts with associated companies amounted to 26 million as of December 31, 2016 and 29 million as of December 31, 2015.
Effective December 31, 2016, the present value of the outstanding minimum rental payments for an office building including parking area payable by BASF SE to BASF Pen sionskasse VVaG for the nonterminable basic rental period to 2029 amounted to 57 million.
There were no reportable related party transactions with members of the Board of Executive Directors or the Super visory Board and their related parties in 2016.

Supplementary Information on the Oil & Gas Segment (Unaudited)

The following provides supplementary information on the E xploration & Production business sector of the Oil & Gas segment. In the absence of detailed disclosure rules in this area under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the presentation is based on the FASB standard Extractive Activities ­ Oil and Gas (Topic 932), which is a further development of SFAS 69. In the following sections, the determination of the amounts complies with the metrics set out by IFRS that underlie the BASF Group Consolidated Finan cial Statements: Operating income from oil and gas-producing activities; Period expenditures for a cquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas d eposits; Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities; and Capitalized exploration drilling: suspended well costs. The definition of companies accounted for using the equity method also follows the approach of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These changes were introduced in 2016 to improve comparability between the Supplementary Information on the Oil & Gas Segment and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts for 2015 have been restated accordingly. The cash flow from the Yuzhno Russkoye project is shown in the fully consolidated company responsible for marketing the gas.
According to Topic 932, the current economic conditions were considered in the determination of oil and gas reserves as well as the standardized calculation of discounted net cash flows. The prices used are valued at the average price calculated from the prices on the first day of the month for the past 12 months. Expected proven reserves and the resulting future net cash flows can vary significantly from the current estimates. Furthermore, the realized prices and costs and the actual cash flows resulting therefrom may differ from the estimate in amount and distribution over time. Therefore, the values presented should not be interpreted as a prediction of future cash flows, nor in their sum as the current value of the company.
Furthermore, different prices, costs and volume estimates are used for operative decisions as well as for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, the reserves and net cash flows shown are not comparable with statements and values in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
According to the requirements in Topic 932, regions with more than a 15% share of total reserves must be shown separately. Therefore, the regions in the supplementary information differ from those presented in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements. Aside from the countries Germany and Russia, this includes the regions: Rest of Europe; North Africa/ Middle East; as well as South America.

The regions include the following countries with operating activities:

Region Rest of Europe
North Africa / Middle East South America

Exploration & Production

Oil and gas reserves
Proven oil and gas reserves are the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and condensate that, according to the geological, engineering and economic conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date, can be produced in future years. Accordingly, reserve estimates based on this data could be materially dif ferent from the volumes that are ultimately recovered. To reduce uncertainties, BASF works together with independent, internationally recognized reserve auditors to perform recurring reserves audits of its major crude oil and natural gas fields.
The tables on the following pages show the company's estimated proven and proven developed reserves as of December 31, 2015, and 2016, as well as changes attributable to production or other factors.

Operating income from oil and gas-producing activities
Operating income represents only those revenues and expenses directly associated with oil, condensate and gas production. This partially results in significant differences to the

figures shown for the Oil & Gas segment. Significant deviations exist in sales revenues that do not include sales from merchandise and services as well as the financing and corporate overhead costs not included there. Income taxes were computed using currently applicable local income tax rates.

Capitalized exploration drilling: Suspended well costs

Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the drilling of the well is complete. If hydrocarbon resources are found whose commercial development is likely, the costs continue to be capitalized as construction in progress, subject to further appraisal activity that may include the drilling of further wells. Management evaluates all such capitalized costs at least once a year from both a technical and economic perspective to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. If this is no longer the case, the relevant costs are written off. If proven reserves of oil or natural gas are determined and development is sanctioned, however, the relevant expenses are transferred within property, plant and equipment to machinery and technical equipment. Impairments for unsuccessful exploration wells are recognized in exploration expenses.
The following table indicates the changes to the capitalized costs of exploration drilling. The determination of the amounts as well as the activities included were adjusted to the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements in 2016. The amounts for 2015 were accordingly restated.
The last row shows the year-end value for equity- accounted companies.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proven oil and gas reserves
The following information was determined based on the regulations on Extractive Activities ­ Oil and Gas (Topic 932) published by FASB. Based on this, a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows with the relevant revenues, costs and income tax rates is to be made. The proven reserves are valued at the average price calculated from the prices on the first day of the month for the past business year. The values thus determined are discounted at a 10% annual discount rate.

A
Associated companies Associated companies are entities in which significant influence can be exercised over their operating and financial policies and which are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or joint operations. In general, this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%.
Audits Audits are a strategic tool for monitoring and directing standards. During a site or plant audit, clearly defined criteria are used to create a profile on topics such as environment, safety or health.
B
Backup line A backup line is a confirmed line of credit that can be drawn upon in connection with the issue of commercial paper if market liquidity is not sufficient, or for the purpose of general corporate financing. It is one of the instruments BASF uses to ensure it is able to make payments at all times.
Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) A barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is an international unit of measurement for comparing the energy content of different fuels. It is equal to one barrel of crude oil, or 6,000 cubic feet (169 cubic meters) of natural gas.
Biotechnology Biotechnology includes all processes and products that make use of living organisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, or their cellular constituents.
BDO BDO stands for 1,4-Butanediol and is a BASF intermediate. BDO and its derivatives are used for producing plastics, solvents, electronic chemicals and elastic fibers.
C
CDP The international nonprofit organization CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) analyzes environmental data of companies. The CDP's indexes serve as assessment tools for investors.
CO2 equivalents CO2 equivalents are units for measuring the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the greenhouse effect. A factor known as the global warming potential (GWP) shows the impact of the individual gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.
Commercial paper program The commercial paper program is a framework agreement between BASF and banks regarding the issuing of debt obligations on the financial market (commercial paper). The commercial paper is issued under a rolling program for which the terms can be determined individually. This requires a good rating.

Compliance Compliance is an important element of corporate governance. It refers to the company's behavior in accordance with laws, guidelines and voluntary codices.
D
Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act issued in 2010 comprises accounting and d isclosure obligations for publicly listed U.S. companies regarding the use of certain raw materials that come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its bordering countries. The companies must prove that the materials they use do not come from mines in these conflict areas. The definition of conflict minerals as per the Dodd-Frank Act includes the following materials and their derivatives: Columbitetantalite (coltan), cassiterite, wolframite and gold.
E
EBIT Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): At BASF, EBIT corresponds to income from operations.
EBIT after cost of capital EBIT after cost of capital is calculated by deducting the cost of capital from the EBIT of the operating divisions. The cost of capital thereby reflects the shareholders' expectations regarding return (in the form of dividends or share price increases) and interest payable to creditors. If the EBIT after cost of capital has a positive value, we have earned a premium on our cost of capital.
EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA): At BASF, EBITDA corresponds to income from operations b efore depreciation and amortization (impairments and write-ups).
EBITDA margin The EBITDA margin is the margin that we earn on sales from our operating activities before depreciation and amortization. It is calculated as income from operations before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales.
Eco-Efficiency Analysis The Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for a ssessing the economic and environmental aspects of products and processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to profit- ability and environmental compatibility.
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, also called tertiary recovery or tertiary production methods, are used to increase the recovery factor from oil reservoirs. Different technologies are employed d epending on reservoir conditions; a distinction is generally made between thermal and chemical EOR and miscible gas flooding, which makes use of gases such as carbon dioxide.
