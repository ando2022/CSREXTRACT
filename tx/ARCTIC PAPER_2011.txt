Letter from the President of Management Board of Arctic Paper S.A.

Dear Sirs,
Year 2011 was characteristic of great changeability. The first quarter was marked with increasing demand for graphic paper in Europe and, on that basis, optimistic expectations regarding the future development of the situation in subsequent months emerged. However, starting from beginning of April, decrease of demand occurred, particularly material in May and June 2011. Market data show decrease of demand in the second quarter by on average 8% compared to the previous quarter and by approximately 9-10% compared to the previous year. The third quarter of 2011 was a significant shift of negative tendency which influenced unsatisfactory results achieved in the first half of the year. Despite the holiday season a great sales volume was achieved. In the fourth quarter of 2011 the positive tendencies initiated in the previous quarter continued. Sales in December ­ while usually it is a month with relatively poor sales ­ turned out to be actually high in 2011. In the year's perspective sales increased by 2.8% compared to 2010 and reached the level of 765 thousand tons. Satisfactory demand for paper produced by Arctic Paper Group allowed for great use of production capacities of the mills ­ over 90%. In the year's perspective revenues amounted to PLN 2,527 million which is over 10% more than in the previous year. Great fluctuations of demand did not allow for increase of raw materials (particularly pulp) prices to translate to paper prices. However, in several segments a slight increase of prices was achieved.
We succeeded to close the year with net profit. The EBITDA attained is at the level similar to the previous years and after exclusion of single occurrings experienced in 2010, it doubled.
The signs of balancing between demand and supply are more and more distinct. It results from the competitors' decisions, both exercised and planned, to permanently or temporary shut-off the production lines. In year's perspective it amounted to nearly 2 million tonnes throughout Europe. The merge of UPM-Kymmene and Myllykoski approved by European Commission opens new possibilities of consolidation in the industry. The results of European paper producers being currently achieved as well as public statements of executives give premises for further merges and production limitations to occur, not for investments in production capacities.
Because of the market conditions and unsatisfactory financial results, Arctic Paper suspended its investment programme regarding development of production in Kostrzyn mill. The minor projects currently realised focus on improving effectiveness, decrease consumption of energy and decrease production costs. Development works are

continued regarding increase of percentage share of sales of papers for purposes other than printing ­ medical care, tech-paper, premium packaging. The development project of water plant in Munkedals is at the stage of acquiring proper administrative permits.
Unsatisfactory financial results force to further seeking of savings and cost reductions as well as organization changes. A programme has been prepared and implemented in all business entities, the purpose of which is to reduce costs by approximately PLN 60 million annually. The effects of these proceedings are already visible, particularly in results of Munkedals mill.
Yours sincerely, Michal Jarczyski President of the Management Board Arctic Paper S.A.

 Uncoated wood-free paper
Wood-free paper for printing. Uncoated wood-free paper can be produced from various types of pulp, with different filler content, and can undergo various finishing enhancing processes, such as surface sizing and calandering. Two main categories of this type of paper are graphic paper (used for example

for printing books and catalogues) and office papers (for instance, photocopy paper),
 Coated wood-free paper
Wood-free paper for printing or other graphic purposes, one-side or two-side coated with mixtures containing mineral pigments, such as china clay, calcium carbonate, etc. The coating process can involve different methods, both online and offline, and can be supplemented by supercalandering to ensure a smooth surface. Coating improves the printing quality of photographs and illustrations;
 Newsprint is paper primarily used to print
newspapers, produced mainly from mechanical

pulp or waste paper pulp, without or with low filler content. Grammage usually ranges from 40 g/m² to 52 g/m². Newsprint is machine-pressed or slightly calandered, white or slightly dyed. This paper is used in reels for letterpress, offset or flexographic printing.
 Magazine paper is wood-containing paper in which
pulp fibers extracted using a chemical method constitute less than 90% of pulp, used for printing color magazines with high circulation, brochures, catalogues, flyers, direct mail, maps and posters:
 Uncoated wood-containing paper
Paper from mechanical pulp intended for printing or other graphic purposes. This type of paper is used

for printing magazines with the use of rotogravure or offset printing techniques. The Group's products in this segment are usually used for printing paperbacks.
 Coated wood-containing paper
Coated paper manufactured from pulp produced by mechanical methods. This paper is also known as ground-wood coated paper. Its use is similar to the use of uncoated wood-containing paper. Additional information about the market environment is provided further on in this report in the section Information on market tendencies.

Development directions and strategy
The Group's main strategies' aims include:

Expansion in Central and Eastern European markets while maintaining leading position in key markets

Our strategic priority over the next few years is to maintain our present leading position in the field of fine paper intended for Western European markets and also to take advantage of the expected growth on the paper market in Central and Eastern Europe. Given their size, the Western European markets will remain our strategic target although we believe that the paper market in Central and Eastern Europe will grow faster than in Western Europe. We expect this growth to be founded

on the long-term rise in paper use per citizen, comparably low at present, and on the expected move of printing houses' production capacity from Western Europe to Central and Eastern Europe. The key elements of this strategy are to take advantage of the competitive edge which we gained thanks to the location and efficient operation of our paper mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr and our well-developed sales network in Central and Eastern Europe.

Maximization of production Capacity and distribution

One of the key elements for the success of our business will be the ability to sustain cost efficiency. Therefore, we have been taking initiatives to:
 maximize energy efficiency,  carefully manage human resources,

 take advantage of our strong bargaining position to
negotiate lower prices of pulp and other raw materials,
 maximize the capacity of our production lines and
the efficiency of the logistics systems.

2010, is shown in note 10.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Customers
Our customer base includes both direct and indirect customers. Direct customers purchase the Group's products in our paper mills. Indirect customers do not purchase the Group's products themselves but use the agency services of advertising companies or paper distributors. They are, however, an important target group for Arctic Paper's advertising campaigns since it is these indirect customers that recommend or request direct customers use the Group's products. Direct and indirect customer groups include:
 printing houses ­ direct customers that purchase
paper produced by the Group directly from the paper mills;
 distributors ­ direct customers that purchase paper
produced by the Group in order to resell it;
 publishing houses ­ direct and indirect customers
that purchase paper produced by the Group directly from the Group in order to use it in their publishing activity and order or recommend the use

of our paper in printing houses in which they order printing of books or other publishings;
 advertising agencies ­ mainly indirect customers
that do not purchase our products directly yet play an important role in ordering and recommending that printing houses use our products, particularly fine paper to print company annual reports, brochures, flyers and packaging;
 end users ­ direct and indirect customers that
purchase our products directly and play an important role in recommending the use of our products in printing houses in which they have commissioned the printing of materials such as annual reports, catalogues, and advertisements.
In our opinion, we do not depend to a significant extent on any specific customer. Based on the Group's consolidated revenues for 2011, the share of our largest customer was not higher than 10% of total sales revenues.

Suppliers
The Group uses the following goods and services in its business:
 pulp  chemicals,  electricity,  transportation services.

Pulp
The basic raw material used by the Group to produce paper is pulp. Except for the paper mill in Mochenwangen, all the Group's paper mills are socalled non-integrated producers, i.e. they purchase all their pulp from external producers. The paper mill in Mochenwangen is partly integrated and has its own pulp

mill with production capacity of approximately 62,100 metric tonnes per year, which accounts for about 62% of the paper mill's total requirements. The Group purchases pulp on the basis of renewable annual contracts executed under framework agreements or in one-off transactions.

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 18 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

Chemicals
The basic chemicals used in paper manufacturing are fillers (mainly calcium carbonate), starch (corn, potato,

tapioca), optical bleaching agents and other chemicals.

Electric power
The Group uses heat and power in the production process. The Kostrzyn paper mill's total demand for heat and power is satisfied from the mill's combined heat and power plant fuelled by natural gas. Gas is supplied under an agreement with a Polish supplier (PGNiG) at prices adjusted annually to reflect changes in the industry indexes published by the Main Statistics Office (GUS); however, the index formula may be renegotiated if the changes exceed the level set out in the agreement. The gas is mined from gas deposits near Kostrzyn nad Odr and transmitted to the paper mill through local gas pipes.

In the analyzed period, electricity for the paper mill in Munkedal was mainly purchased from external suppliers. The Group also purchased fuel oil in order to satisfy part of the Group's demand for heat.
The paper mill in Mochenwangen satisfies the total demand for heat and about a half the electricity demand by using mineral coal. The remaining part of the demand for electricity is satisfied by purchasing from external suppliers.
The energy source In Arctic Paper Grycksbo AB paper mill is biomass and electricity partly purchased from outside suppliers.

Transportation services
The Group does not have its own trucks and uses professional outsourcing services to distribute products from paper mills and warehouses to its customers.

The Group entities are not dependent on their suppliers. Based on the Group's consolidated revenues for 2011, the share of the largest supplier was not more than 10% of total sales revenues.

Business seasonality and cycles
Demand for the Group's products fluctuates slightly during the year. Lower demand for paper is reported each year during summer holidays and in Christmas season when a number of printing houses, particularly

those in Western Europe, are closed for business. The changes in the demand for paper are not significant compared to the demand in other months

R&D
R&D in the Arctic Paper Group is primarily intended to advance and innovate production processes and to improve products' quality and increase product assortment. R&D is carried out at Kostrzyn and Munkedals. In the period covered by this report, both

companies carried out R&D work to streamline the production process, particularly by shortening machine idle time, and to improve paper quality along with expanding the assortment range.

Natural environment
Our Group observes the environmental standards laid down in numerous legal regulations and administrative decisions. These standards are intended to protect soil, air and water against pollution, noise and the impact of

electromagnetic fields. We describe below how the environmental regulations affect the operations of our paper mills.

Kostrzyn Paper Mill Based on the decision of the Lubuskie Voivode of 8th December 2005, Kostrzyn obtained an integrated permit for a paper production installation combined with a fuel combustion installation located in the mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr. For Kostrzyn, the requirement to obtain this permit was due to the mill's paper production capacity of over 20 metric tonnes a day. In order to meet the requirements set out in the permit and other environmental waste management standards, Kostrzyn executed a number of agreements for industrial waste collection and utilization.
In May 2008 a new sewage treatment plant was opened in the paper mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr. Based on the decision of the Lubuskie Voivode of 14 August 2007, Kostrzyn obtained a water permit to discharge rainwater and run-off water and to build a water structure in the form of a dock discharging waters to the Warta River (permit valid until 1st August 2017).
AP Kostrzyn participates in the EU Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (EU Emission Allowances Trading Scheme) based on a permit granted in the decision of the Lubuskie Voivode of 17th February 2006 (amended by the decisions of 28th March 2006, 1st

June 2006, 13th December 2006, 4th May 2007 and 6th January 2009) for the paper production installation with production capacity of over 20 metric tonnes a day located in the mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr. The permit was granted until 31 December 2015. Under the permit, Kostrzyn has to monitor carbon dioxide emissions and submit annual emission reports.
In view of the environmental protection policy, Kostrzyn made significant investments, including an investment in a new gas-fuelled heat and power plant which was opened in 2007 (first stage) and 2009 (second stage). The paper mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr holds environmental compliance certificates: OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and EMAS. Moreover, the paper manufactured in this mill is FSC and PEFC certified. These certificates are granted to certify that the pulp used to manufacture paper comes from forests managed in a balanced manner. The FSC certificate (Forest Stewardship Council) is one of the most important certificates granted to paper companies. The first FSC certificate for the paper manufactured by the Kostrzyn mill was granted in 2006. At present, the Amber paper from the paper mill in Kostrzyn nad Odr is manufactured from FSC certified pulp ­ 85%, and from PEFC (Programme for the

Endorsement of Forest Certification) certified pulp -
Munkedals Paper Mill The Munkedals business complies with environmental management systems EMAS and ISO 14001. EMAS (Eco- Management and Audit Scheme) is a voluntary system applied in the EU to distinguish businesses that constantly improve environmental protection levels as part of their operations. Businesses registered in EMAS observe environmental regulations, maintain an environmental management system and inform the public about environmental protection as part of the activity carried out in the form of an independent audited statement on environmental protection compliance. The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has developed various standards, among them ISO 14000, some of the most recognized standards for environmental protection (i.e. actions taken by business to (i) limit their negative impact on the environment; and (ii) ensure constant improvement of environmental protection levels).
Mochenwangen Paper Mill Mochenwangen obtained a permit to produce a daily maximum of approximately 475 metric tonnes gross of paper.
Wood used to produce book and specialty papers obtained certificates of FSC and PEFC. The FSC certificate is issued after independent agencies have assessed whether forest production complies with international standards of balanced management, environmental and social welfare protection.
Grycksbo Paper Mill Paper production In the Arctic Paper AB Grycksbo is performed In accordance with the environmental permit in march 2007. The permit is issued by the Swedish Environmental Court and allows production up to 310,000 tonnes per year. In addition, the mill has also a permit to emit carbon dioxide released by authorities of

15%.
Some of the real properties owned by Munkedals are located in Natura 2000 areas. These Natura 2000 areas are wild nature reserves established on the basis of a decision issued by the Munkedal District Council (Sweden) in 2005 Natura 2000 areas were established to preserve the most endangered natural habitats and fauna and flora in Europe. The scope of protection and the restriction on business activities are laid down in Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) and Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2nd April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (the Birds Directive) and relevant domestic regulations. The level of habitat and bird conservation in the Natura 2000 areas depends on the species and/or habitats in those areas under conservation.
Mochenwangen participates in the EU Emission Allowances Trading Scheme when manufacturing paper and generating power in coal-fuelled power plants. For the years 2008-2012 Mochenwangen was allocated free of charge 118,991 emission allowances per year, which corresponds to the average number of allowances per year required by Mochenwangen over that period. Mochenwangen has to monitor carbon dioxide emissions and submit annual emission reports to the German Emission Allowances Trading Authority.
the regional province of Dalarna. Being a paper Mill oriented on environment is a way for Arctic Paper Grycksbo AB to ensure survival in the long term. Since 1997, Arctic Paper Grycksbo AB has had certificate ISO 14001 and our environmental activities are reported in accordance with EMAS. The primary objective of EMAS

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

is to encourage member organizations to improve environmental protection in a systematic and consistent way, even in excess of legislative requirements. This is done by setting up a program consisting of specific action programs and evaluate all significant environmental impacts associated with the business. Companies are required to prepare annual reports on the results of their pro-environmental activities. Independent auditors ensure that firms keep their commitments.
Arctic Paper AB Grycksbo takes part In the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas pollutant, although the 2010 is a milestone for the factory because it was the first year in which reported zero carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. This was possible by a substantial reconstruction of the boiler in conjunction with investment in equipment to handle biofuels, electric exhaust particulate filters and

conversion turbines to produce electricity from renewable sources.
In numbers, a shift to biofuels is an annual reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels by about 70,000 tonnes. Rebuilt turbo allows to meet 20% of our electricity needs through renewable sources of energy, which is produced by the mill itself, which in turn leads to an annual reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by a further 4,000 tonnes.
The mill has implemented energy management system in accordance with SS 62 77 50 (Swedish standard for energy management), participates in PFE (Swedish Energy Efficiency Programme) and plans to introduce ISO 50001 standard (Energy Management System) in 2012. Our products are reviewed under the ,,Chain of Custody" under FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and in accordance with PEFC (Programme for the Support of the Principles for Sustainable Forest Management).

Cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses

Profit on sales in 2011 was 37.1% higher than in the previous year. The sales profit margin in the current year stood at 14.01% compared to 11.28% (+2.7 p.p.) in the previous year.
The main reason for the increase of profit on sales in 2011, compared to the previous year, was lower cost of sales resulting from decreasing prices of pulp, especially in 2H 2011.
In 2011 selling expenses amounted to PLN 294,405 thousand which represents an increase by 7,9% compared to costs incurred in 2010. The main reason for the increase in selling expenses in 2011 were costs incurred at AP Grycksbo which were consolidated from March as well as increase in transportation costs. In

2011 selling expenses per tonne of paper sold increased by 5% compared to 2010.
In 2011 administrative expenses amounted to PLN 71,509 thousand compared to PLN 57,273 thousand in 2010, which represents an increase by 24.9%. It also means the rise of administrative expenses per tonne sold. The main reason for increase of these expenses in 2011 was the inclusion of AP Grycksbo in the consolidation since 1st March 2010, as well as the costs incurred for realisation of the Group's projects including costs related to conducting negotiations and preparing merge with another entity as reported in current report no 21/2011 published on 30th August 2011.

Other operating income and expenses
Other operating income in 2011 amounted to PLN 72,578 tys. PLN which means a decrease compared to the same period of previous year by PLN 77,602 thousand. Other operating income in 2011 comprised mostly heat and electricity sales income in AP Kostrzyn as well as income from sales of pulp and other materials.
The most important factor which had impact on material decrease of other operating income in 2011 was the fact

that in 2010 occurred the recognition of negative goodwill from occasional acquisition of AP Grycksbo.
Other operating expenses in 2011 amounted to PLN 57,492 thousand compared to PLN 60,372 thousand in 2010. The major share in other operating expenses was the own cost of sales of energy and materials as well as cost of sales of pulp and other materials.

Financial income and cost
In 2011 financial income amounted to PLN 42,682 thousand and were higher comparing to financial income recorded in 2010 by PLN 22,620 thousand. The significantly higher financial income in 2011 was caused mostly by positive foreign exchange differences. A material part of the exchange differences was constituted by its unrealised part resulted from evaluation of the liability of loan to Arctic Paper Investment AB granted in PLN by Arctic Paper S.A. The

loan was related to acquisition of AP Grycksbo mill in March 2010. The impact of this evaluation amounted in 2011 to PLN 30,967 thousand.
Financial cost in 2011 amounted to PLN 45,668 thousand PLN compared to PLN 30,393 thousand in 2010. This increase in financial cost in 2011 results from interest costs of PLN 40,829 thousand compared to PLN 30,370 thousand in the previous year.

Income tax
Income tax in 2011 amounted to PLN +11,937 thousand while in 2010 it amounted to PLN +21,467 thousand.

Positive effect of the income tax resulted from the recognition of assets from deferred income tax on temporary differences and tax losses workable in future.

Profitability analysis
EBITDA in 2011 amounted to PLN 141,762 thousand while in 2010 it amounted to PLN 146,294 thousand. In the reporting period EBITDA margin amounted to 5.61% compared to 6.39% in 2010.

2010), therein inventories 16.3% (15.2% at the end of 2010), receivables 15.6% (14.5% at the end of 2010), other current assets 0.5% (0.8% at the end of 2010) and

cash and cash equivalents 8.6% (9.4% at the end of 2010).

Equity
As at the end of 2011 equity amounted to PLN 675,561 thousand compared to PLN 667,943 thousand as at the end of 2010. As at the end of 2011, equity represented

35.0% of the total equity and liabilities. The share of equity in total equity and liabilities has not changed compared to the end of December 2010.

Current liabilities
As at the end of December 2011 current liabilities amounted to PLN 612,273 thousand (32% of the total balance sheet amount) compared to PLN 742,608 thousand (39% of the total balance sheet amount) at the end of 2010. In 2011 there was a decrease in current liabilities by PLN 130,335 thousand. The change was

primarily due to repayment of zero-coupon 1-year old bonds with redemption date in February 2011. For this purpose the Company issued new medium-term 2-year old bonds which were shown as on 31st December 2011 as long-term liabilities.

Non-current liabilities
As at the end of December 2011 long-term liabilities amounted to PLN 636,697 thousand (33% of the total balance sheet amount) compared to PLN 500,218 thousand at the end of 2010 (accordingly 26% of the

total balance sheet amount). In the analyzed period, there was an increase of long-term liabilities by PLN 136,479 thousand which resulted mainly from the issue of new medium-term bonds.

Cash flow from operating activities
In 2011 net cash flow from operating activities amounted to PLN 162,247 thousand compared to PLN 120,409 thousand in 2010. Higher cash flow from operating activities in 2011 resulted primarily from utilization of the CO2 emission rights recognized while

acquiring AP Grycksbo and AP Mochenwangen and greater gross profit in 2011, compared to the result achieved in 2010 having excluded profit on occasional acquisition of AP Grycksbo.

Cash flow from investment activities
In 2011 cash flow from investment activities amounted to PLN -56,375 thousand compared to PLN -230,583 thousand in 2010. The reported change was mainly due to the acquisition of AP Grycksbo in 2010. Cash flows

from investment activities in the whole 2011 comprise mainly expenses for purchasing of property, plant and equipment and intangibles.

Cash flow from financial activities
In 2011 cash flow from financial activities amounted to PLN -121,615 thousand compared to PLN +129,973 thousand in 2010. In twelve months of 2011 cash flow from financial activities related mostly to the refinancing

of AP Munkedals debt by Svenska Handelsbanken AB bank as well as issue and repayment of bonds performed in February 2011.

Relevant information and factors influencing financial results and evaluation of financial standing

Key factors affecting the performance results
The Group's operating activity has been historically and will be in the future influenced by the following key factors:
 macroeconomic and other economic factors;  paper prices;  pulp and energy prices;  currency exchange rates fluctuations.

Macroeconomic and other economic factors We believe that a number of macroeconomic and other economic factors have a profound impact on the demand for high-quality paper and these factors may also influence the demand for the Group's products and our operating results. These factors include:
 GDP growth  net income ­ as a measure of income and
prosperity of a population,
 production capacities ­ oversupply lingering in the
segment of high quality paper and decline of margins on paper sales;
 paper consumption;  technological development.
Paper prices The prices of paper undergo cyclic changes and fluctuations, depend on global changes in demand and overall macroeconomic and other economic factors such as those indicated above. The prices of paper are also influenced by a number of factors connected with supply, primarily the changes in production capacities on the global and European levels.

Costs of raw materials, energy and transportation The main elements of the Group's operating expenses are costs of raw materials, energy and transportation. The costs of raw materials include particularly the costs of pulp, timber and chemical agents used for paper production. Our energy costs, historically speaking, include first of costs of electricity, gas, coal and fuel oil. Costs of transportation include the costs of transportation services rendered to the Group by external service providers only.
Taking into account the share of those costs in the total operating expenses of the Group and the limited possibility of controlling those costs by the Company, the fluctuations of the costs may have a significant impact on profitability.
Currency exchange rates fluctuations Our operating results are significantly influenced by currency exchange rates fluctuations. In particular, our revenues and costs are expressed in different foreign currencies and do not match, therefore, the appreciation of currencies in which we incur costs towards currencies in which we generate revenues, will have an adverse effect on our results. We sell our products in all EURO zone countries, the Nordic countries, Poland and UK,

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 30 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

therefore, our revenues are to a great extent expressed in EUR, GBP, SEK and PLN. The Group's operating expenses are primarily expressed in USD (pulp costs), EUR (costs related to pulp, transportation, chemicals and majority of costs related to the operations of the Mochenwangen paper mill), PLN (the majority of other costs incurred by the Kostrzyn nad Odr mill) and SEK

(the majority of other costs incurred by the Munkedal and Grycksbo mills).
Exchange rates also have an important influence on results reported in our financial statements because of changes in exchange rates of currencies in which we generate revenues and incur costs, and the currency in which we report our financial results (PLN).

Unusual developments and factors
During the reported period there were no unusual events and/or factors.

Impact of changes in the Arctic Paper Group's structure on the financial result
In 2011 there were no significant changes in the structure of the Group that would have impact on financial result achieved.

Other material information
During the reported period there were no other material occurrences which would affect the evaluation of the HR, property, financial situation or the financial result

and their changes, or would be material from the point of view of the Company's ability to perform its obligations.

Factors influencing Arctic Paper Group development

Information on market tendencies

Supplies, demand and capacity
In 2011 supplies of high quality paper to the European market were approximately 4.4% lower compared to 2010. During this period, supplies in the segment of uncoated wood-free paper (UWF) were 4.1% lower, while those in the segment of coated wood-free paper (CWF) 4.7% lower.

The dynamics of changes in 2011 as regards supplies level and estimated demand for high quality paper in Europe indicates demand decline.
Data source: Cepifine, RISI, an analysis of Arctic Paper

Prices of high quality paper
In 2011 prices of high quality paper decreased.

At the end of 2011 levels of declared prices for uncoated wood-free paper for the selected markets of

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 31 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

Germany, France, Spain, Italy and United Kingdom expressed in EUR and GBP were lower than at the end of the previous year by app. 2.8%. Similarly, prices of coated wood-free paper decreased by app. 5.1%.
Average prices invoiced by Arctic Paper in EUR in the segment of uncoated wood-free paper changed between January and December 2011 within the range from -5.6% to +2%, whereas prices of coated woodfree paper from -9.3% to -1.8%.

Because of that, RISI price estimations for a particular month do not reflect real prices by which deliveries are made. They only express ordering prices. For Arctic Paper products average invoiced sales prices for all served markets in EUR.

Pulp prices
At the end of 2011 pulp prices reached a level of USD 834,0 per tonne for NBSK and USD 652,0 per tonne for BHKP.
At the end of 2011 the pulp price was lower by 12.1% (NBSK) and 23.2% (BHKP), compared to prices as at the end of 2010.
Pulp costs are subject to frequent changes. Decrease in prices of raw materials, in particular pulp, has a profound impact on Group's profitability.
The average cost of pulp per tonne sold as calculated

for the Group expressed in PLN in 2011 decreased compared to 2010 by 2.4%.
In 2011 the share of pulp costs in own sales cost amounted to 46.7%, whereas in 2010 it amounted to 49.8%.
Arctic Paper Group uses the pulp in the production process according to the following structure: BHKP 59%, NBSK 19% and the remaining 22%.

Currency exchange rates
The EUR/PLN exchange rate at the end of 2011 amounted to 4.4168 and was higher by 11.5% than at the end of 2010. The average exchange rate EUR/PLN in 2011 was higher by 3.1% compared to 2010.
At the end of 2011 EUR/SEK rate amounted to 8.9228 and was 0.5% lower than at the end of 2010. For this pairing, the average rate in 2011 was lower by as much as 5.4% than in 2010.
These changes mean that in 2011 occurred a depreciation of PLN in relation to EUR, which had very positive impact on the Group's financial results, in

particular in connection with sales revenues generated by AP Kostrzyn in EUR and expressed in PLN. A different situation was observed concerning the relation of EUR to SEK where during the year a strong appreciation of Swedish currency occurred and had an adverse impact on levels of revenues realised in Grycksbo and Munkedals mills.
At the end of 2011 USD/PLN exchange rate amounted to 3.4174. In 2011 the average USD/PLN rate amounted to 2.9636 compared to 3.0179 in the previous year which represents a decrease by 1.8%.

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 32 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

At the end of 2011 USD/SEK rate amounted to 6.9038. The average exchange rate in 2011 amounted to 6.4830 compared to 7.2038 in the previous year which means a decrease by 10%.
The changes in USD/PLN and USD/SEK rates had a positive impact on the results of 2011 as they translate to reduction in prices of raw materials purchased in USD.
At the end of December 2011 EUR/USD rate amounted

to 1.2924 compared to 1.3361 (-3.3%) at the end of December 2010. In 2011 a depreciation of USD in relation to EUR occurred. In 2011, the average exchange rate equaled 1.3929 compared to 1,3267 in the previous year which means depreciation of USD in relation to EUR by 4.9%.
Depreciation of PLN in relation to EUR and SEK and depreciation of PLN and SEK in relation to USD had a positive impact on the Group's financial results in 2011.

Factors influencing the financial results in the perspective of the new year

Material factors which have an impact on the financial results in the perspective of the next year include:

 The levels of high quality paper prices, in particular,
being able to further increase paper prices, in connection with pulp prices remaining at high levels and adverse changes in exchange rates determining our sales revenues, particularly in Sweden.
 Pricing of raw materials, including pulp and
electricity; in particular, an adverse effect on the financial results may be caused by pulp prices remaining at high levels or its increase.

Furthermore, the fluctuations of electricity prices in Sweden, which the Group experienced in 2010, and which translated into lower sales profitability at AP Munkedals and AP Grycksbo, have a material adverse effect on the Group's performance.
 Currency rates fluctuations; in particular, the
strengthening of PLN and SEK in relation to EUR and GBP, the strengthening of PLN in relation to SEK, and depreciation of PLN and SEK in relation to USD, can have an adverse effect on the financial results.

Risk factors

Significant changes in risk factors
In 2011 there were no significant changes in scope of risk factors.

Risk factors connected with the Group's environment

The order in which the following risk factors are presented does not reflect the likelihood of their occurrence, scope or significance of the risks.

Risk of growing competition in the paper market in Europe Our Group operates in a highly competitive market. The accomplishment of the strategic objectives assumed by

the Group can be difficult because of the activities of competitors, in particular, integrated paper producers operating on a scale larger than our Group. A potential growth of competition resulting from a possible increase

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 33 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

in production capacities of our competitors, and thus, in the paper supply in the market, can have an adverse effect on the achievement of planned revenues and the ability to achieve financial and operating assumptions made.
Risk of changes in law Our Group operates in a legal environment characterized by a high level of uncertainty. Regulations concerning our activities are often amended and there is no uniform interpretation, which involves a risk of a breach of applicable regulations and related consequences, even if the breach of law is inadvertent. Furthermore, changes in environmental protection and other regulations may result in significant expenditures to ensure compliance, among other things, with more restrictive regulations or stricter implementation of applicable regulations concerning surface water, ground water, soil and air protection.
Foreign exchange rates risk The Group's revenues, costs and results are exposed to the risk of a change of currency exchange rates, in particular, PLN and SEK to EUR, GBP and other currencies. Our Group exports a large part of the produced paper to the European markets, generating a significant part of its sales revenues in EUR, GBP, PLN,

and SEK. The costs of procurement of raw materials for paper production, in particular pulp, are paid mainly in USD and EUR. Furthermore, we have obligations on account of loans taken in PLN, EUR and SEK. The currency used in financial statements is PLN, and therefore, our revenues, costs and results achieved by the subsidiaries situated abroad are dependent on the levels of currency exchange rates. Thus, currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Group's results, financial standing and outlook.
The risk of changes of interest rates The Group is exposed to the risk of changes of interest rates, mainly due to an existing interest debt. This risk results from fluctuation in the benchmark interest rate such as WIBOR for debt in PLN, EURIBOR for the debt in EUR and STIBOR for debt in SEK. Adverse changes of interest rates may adversely affect the results, financial situation and prospects of the Group.
Risk of the growing importance of alternative media The trends in advertising, electronic transmission and storage of data, as well as Internet, may have an adverse effect on traditional print media, and in consequence, on the products of the Group and its customers, but it is not possible to predict the timing or scope of those trends with a high degree of certainty.

Risk factors connected with the Group's activities

The order in which the following risk factors are presented does not reflect the likelihood of their occurrence, scope or significance of the risks.

Risks connected with relative low operating margins Historically the Group's operating results have been characterized by relatively high volatility and low operating margins. The decline in revenues caused, among other things, by the change of production capacities, productivity, pricing policy or an increase in operating expenses, the main components of which are the costs or raw materials (mainly pulp) and energy, may

lead to the loss of Group's ability to generate profits. Material adverse changes of profitability can lead to a decline in the value of our shares and limit our ability to generate working capital, bringing about serious damage to our business and significantly worsening our prospects.

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 34 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

Risk of changes of prices of raw materials, energy and products We are exposed to the risk of changes of prices of raw materials and energy primarily in connection with the changing prices of pulp, fuel oil, diesel oil, coal and electricity. The Group buys pulp under framework agreements or one-time transaction and does not hedge against pulp price fluctuations. Neither does the Group hedge against the risk of an increase in coal and fuel oil prices used in AP Mochenwangen mill. The risk of change of prices of products is connected primarily with changes of paper prices in markets where we sell our products. Any significant increase in the prices of one or more than one raw material and energy can have an adverse effect on the Group's results on operating activities and financial standing.
Risk of disturbances in production process Our Group has four Paper Mills with ten production lines in total, with the aggregate annual production capacities of more than 800,000 tonnes of paper. Any lasting disturbance of the production process can be caused by a number of factors, including an emergency failure, human errors, unavailability of raw materials, a natural disaster and other, which often are beyond our control. Any distortion, even relatively short, may have a material impact on our production and profitability and may involve significant costs such as repair, liability towards customers, whose orders we are not able to carry out and other expenditures.
Risk connected with our investment projects The Group's investment projects in order to enhance the Group's production capacities generally require significant investments and relatively long period of implementation. Therefore, the market conditions in which we operate can change significantly between the time when we make a decision on making investments in increasing production capacities and the time when the increased production capacities become

operational. A change of market conditions can lead to fluctuations of demand for our products, which may be too low in the context of the additional production capacities. The differences between the future demand and investments in new production capacities may lead to the increased production capacities not being fully used. This may have an adverse effect on the Group's operations and financial standing.
Risk connected with the Group's debt Our Group has indebtedness on account of a loan agreement with Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. dated 23rd October 2008 and of the bonds issued in February 2010 and February 2011 as well as debt under the loan agreement with a bank Svenska Handelsbanken dated 01st and 26th February 2010 and 26th January 2011. It is possible that we will not be able to make timely repayments or refinance our debt on account of loan and/or bonds, and also to keep the level of financial ratios that depend on the results generated by the Group accounts, as defined in the loan agreement and the terms of the bond issue, which may give rise to breaches of a loan agreement or the terms of the bond issue and the loss of collateralized assets. If an event of default occurs, it could lead in particular to bring in a state of maturity of our debt, the bank can take over control over critical assets such as the Paper Mills, credibility reduction and a loss of access to external sources of finance, and consequently, a loss of financial liquidity, which may have an adverse effect on our business and outlook, and our stock prices.
Risk of limitations on natural gas supplies The only supplier of natural gas used by AP Kostrzyn to generate thermal and electric energy for paper production purposes is Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo S.A. (PGNiG). Therefore, the availability and prices of natural gas have a significant effect on the operations and costs of paper production at AP Kostrzyn. Any distortions in gas supplies to the paper

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 35 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

mill at Kostrzyn nad Odr may have an adverse effect on the Group's production, operating results and financial standing.
Risk of loss of tax reliefs in connection with AP Kostrzyn operations AP Kostrzyn enjoys a significant tax relief thanks to conducting its business activity within the KostrzyskoSlubicka Special Economic Zone. The relief was granted until 2017 and depends on AP Kostrzyn's compliance with the statutory provisions, regulations and other conditions for using a tax relief, including the compliance with certain criteria related to employment and investments. Changes of tax regulations in Poland are particularly frequent. Changes in regulations concerning that tax relief or any breach by AP Kostrzyn of the conditions of the permit based on which the relief has been granted may result in the loss of the relief and have a material adverse effect on the Group's operating results and financial standing.
Risk connected with taxation of equity contribution In 2007, AP Munkedals transferred to Arctic Paper AB (which at the time owned all Munkedals shares) the socalled group contribution (koncernbidrag ­ a Swedish law concept) of SEK 200 million. At the same time, Arctic Paper AB made a cash contribution of SEK 172 million to AP Munkedals. As a result of the above operations, AP Munkedals tax loss increased which can be credited against income in subsequent tax years. Even though under the Swedish tax law such actions are admissible, there is a high risk that as a result of the transfer of AP Munkedals shares to Arctic Paper S.A. and the introduction of Company shares to the WSE regulated market, the Swedish tax authorities will question the settlement of the loss in line with the Swedish Act on Tax Avoidance. If Swedish tax authorities effectively challenge the settlement of the loss, it will not be possible to credit the loss resulting from the transfer of the Group contribution.

Furthermore, AP Munkedals can be required by the Swedish tax authorities to pay an additional tax of 10% of the value of the group contribution transferred to Arctic Paper AB, i.e. SEK 20 million, which may have an adverse effect on the Group's financial standing.
Risk connected with consolidation and liquidity of the key customers Consolidation tendencies among our present and potential customers may result in the emergence of a more concentrated customer base consisting of several large customers. Those customers may take advantage of a more favorable negotiating position when negotiating conditions of paper purchase or make a decision regarding change of a supplier and buy products of our competitors. Each of the above factors can have an adverse effect on the Group's operating results and financial standing.
Risk connected with compliance with environmental regulations and adverse impact of the production process on environment The Group meets the environmental protection requirements, however, it is not certain that it will always perform its obligations and that in the future it will not incur significant costs or other material obligations in connection with those requirements or that it will be able to obtain all permits, approvals or other authorizations necessary for it to carry out its activities in the intended manner. Similarly, given that paper production involves potential threats related to waste discharged by paper mills or pollution with chemical substances, we cannot be certain that in the future the Group will not be held liable because of environmental pollution or that an event which will be a basis for holding the Group liable has not occurred yet. Thus, the Group may incur significant expenditures when having to remove pollution and reclaim land.
Risk connected with CO2 emission limits

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 36 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Management Board Report on the Operations of Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

Our paper mills get carbon dioxide emission allowances for a given period. Emission allowances are granted as part of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. Starting from 2013, a new emission trading scheme is expected to be introduced. The nature of the new system has not been determined yet but if free of charge carbon dioxide allowances are eliminated and replaced with a system of buying emission allowances against payment, the energy generation costs incurred by us will increase accordingly. Furthermore, we may be forced to incur other costs, which are now hard to predict, in connection with emission allowances or changes in legal regulations and requirements resulting from that. For that reason we may be forced to reduce the volume of energy generated or to increase the costs of production,

which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial standing, operating results or development prospects.
Risk connected with the Company's ability to pay dividend The Issuer is a holding company, thus its ability to pay dividend depends on the level of distributions it receives from operational subsidiaries and the level of its cash balances. Some of the Group's subsidiaries conducting operating activity may in certain periods be subject to limitations concerning distributions to the Issuer. It is not certain that such limitations will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's activities, operating results and ability to pay dividend.

Supplementary information

Management Board position on the possibility to achieve the projected financial results published earlier
The Management Board of Arctic Paper S.A. did not publish forecast of financial results for 2011, and has not published and does not plan to publish forecast of financial results for 2012.

Information on dividend
Dividend is paid based on net profit disclosed in the standalone annual financial statements of Arctic Paper S.A., having taken into account the absorption of losses from prior years.
In accordance with the requirements of the Code of Commercial Companies, the parent company is required to create a capital reserve to cover losses. For this category of capital poured into at least 8% profit for the year shown in the standalone financial statement of the parent company until the capital reaches at least one third of the share capital of the parent. The use of capital and reserve is decided by the Shareholders Meeting;

however, part of the reserve capital in the amount of one-third of the share capital can be used only to cover the loss shown in the standalone financial statements of the parent and is not subject to the division for other purposes.
As on the date of this report, the Company does not have preferred shares.
Payment of dividend by the Company to its shareholders depends on the payments received from its subsidiaries. Risk related to the Company's ability to pay dividend is described in the part Risk factors of this report.

In 2011 the Company did not pay dividend.

Issue, buy-out and repayment of non-equity and equity securities

On 7th February 2011 an annex to the agreement dated 11th February 2010 was concluded between the Company and BRE Bank S.A. regarding Bonds Issue Programme. By the power of the annex, the maximum Value of Bonds Issue Programme was raised from the amount of PLN 200,000 thousand to PLN 300,000 thousand.
On 10th February 2011 the coupon bonds of 1/2011 series were issued. The bonds are unsecured bearer bonds with PLN 100,000 face value each. The total number of bonds issued under the 1/2011 series is 800 with combined face value of PLN 80 million. The issue price of each bond is PLN 100,000. Net proceeds from the issue amounting to PLN 80 million will be used for re-financing of the Issuer's debt.
On 25th February 2013 (,,Redemption Date") the Issuer, acting through the Payment Agent, will pay the Principal Amount (face value) of each bond. Payments for the bonds will be made to bondholders entered in the Register as of the Rights Attribution Date. If however the Redemption Date is not a Working Day, the Principal

A resolution so adopted is valid if all Board members have been informed of the wording of the draft resolution. The date on which such a resolution is adopted is the date on which the last Supervisory Board member signs it.
Supervisory Board resolutions may be adopted if all members have been notified by registered mail, fax or e-mail, sent at least 15 days in advance and most of the Board members are present at the meeting.
Resolutions may be adopted without a formal convening of a meeting if all Board members consent to a vote on a given issue or to the wording of the resolution which is to be adopted.
Supervisory Board resolutions are adopted by a simple majority of votes cast; in the case of a voting deadlock, the Supervisory Board Chairman has the casting vote.
The detailed operations of the Supervisory Board are laid down in the Supervisory Board By-laws which are available at:

Obligation under operating and finance leases ­ the Group as a lessee The Group has leasing agreements which, in the Management Board's judgement, meet the criteria of operating leases and agreements which meet the criteria of finance leases. The Group classifies its lease agreements as finance leases or operating leases based on the assessment of the extent to which substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership have been transferred from the lessor to the lessee. The assessment is based on economic substance of each agreement.
Deferred tax asset Application of professional judgement allowed to determine the value of the deferred tax asset which the Group may recognize using the forecasted date and

amount of future profits and basing on the future tax strategies.
Gas Agreement The Group enters into ,,take or pay" transactions in respect of receipt of supplies of gas to Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. for own use purposes. For these transactions, on each balance sheet date, the Management Board, using its professional judgment, assesses the probability of use of outstanding amounts within the granted limits, after considering the production plans for the ensuing periods and the optimum possibilities of utilization of alternative sources of materials for production. Where no real possibility of future use of outstanding amounts of gas are ascertained, the asset arising from paid for but uncollected amounts of gas is subject to the writedown.

5.2. Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty on the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are being discussed below.
Impairment of Fixed Assets In Arctic Paper Mochenwangen On 31st December 2011 an impairment test was conducted in the production company Arctic Paper Mochenwangen in respect of fixed assets and intangible assets.

A detailed description of the impairment test is included in Note 25 of these financial statements.
Retirement benefits and other post-employment benefits The cost of the pogramme for retirement benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The assumptions made are presented in note 26. In making the actuarial valuation, certain assumptions must be made concerning discounting rates, forecasted rate of salary increases, mortality ratio or forecasted growth in retirement benefits. Due to the long-term nature of such programs, actuarial valuations are burdened with a degree of uncertainty.

 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments:
presentation: Classification of right issues. The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. The adoption of this amendment did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

9. Summary of significant accounting policies

9.1. Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Arctic Paper S.A. and its

subsidiaries for the year ended 31st December 2011. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared

Page 73 of 152

for the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent accounting policies, and based on the same accounting policies applied to similar business transactions and events. Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist. All significant intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless they indicate impairment.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which such control is transferred out of the Group. An entity is controlled by the parent company when the parent has, directly or

indirectly through its subsidiaries, more than half of the votes at the shareholders meeting of that entity, unless it is possible to prove that such holding does not represent control. Control is also exercised if the company has the power to govern the financial or operating policy of an enterprise.
Changes in the parent's ownership interest that do not result in loss of control of the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions. In such cases, to reflect changes in the relative shares in the subsidiary the Group revises the carrying value of controlling and noncontrolling shares. Any difference between the amount of correction of non-controlling interests and the fair value of the price paid or received are recognized in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

9.2. Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currency of the entity are translated into functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.
On the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than functional currency of the entity are translated into functional currency using the average foreign exchange rate prevailing for the given currency at the end of the reported period. Exchange differences resulting from translation are recorded under finance revenue or finance costs or under capitalized cost of assets, based on defined examples in accounting policy. Nonmonetary foreign currency assets and liabilities recognized at historical cost are translated at the historical foreign exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are translated into

Polish zloty using the rate of exchange binding as at the date of re-measurement to fair value.
The functional currencies of the foreign subsidiaries are EUR, SEK, LVL, DKK, NOK, GBP and CHF. On the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group (Polish zloty) using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated using the weighted average exchange rates for the given reporting period. The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to equity and accumulated in a separate position of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the deferred exchange differences recognized in equity and relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognized in the income statement.

9.3. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost (price of purchase or construction cost) less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The initial value of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Cost also comprises the cost of replacement of fixed asset components when incurred, if the recognition criteria have been met. Subsequent expenditures, such as repair or

maintenance costs, are expensed as presented in the income statement in the reporting period in which they were incurred.
Upon purchase, fixed assets are divided into components, which represent items with a significant value that can be allocated a separate useful life. Overhauls also represent asset component.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, presented as below:

Residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if necessary, adjusted retrospectively i.e. with effect from the beginning of the reporting period that has just ended.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its further use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal

proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in the income statement for the period in which derecognition took place.
Assets under construction (construction in progress) include assets in the course of construction or assembly and are recognized at purchase price or cost of construction less any impairment losses. Assets under construction are not depreciated until completed and brought into use.

9.4. Investment properties
Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time the cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met; and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an investment property.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the value of investment properties is presented according to fair value. Any gains or losses resulting from changes of fair value of the investment properties are recognized in gain or loss of the period in which it occurred.
Investment property is derecognized when disposed of or permanently withdrawn from use and no future benefits are expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on derecognition of investment property are recognized in the income statement for the year in which such derecognition took place.

Transfers of assets are made to investment properties when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by ending of owner occupation, commencement of an operating lease, and the Group accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under Property, Plant and Equipment (note 9.3) up to the date of change in use. For a transfer of assets from inventories to investment property, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount is recognized in profit or loss.
For a transfer from investment property to owneroccupied property or inventories, the deemed cost of property for subsequent accounting is its fair value on the date of change in use.

9.5. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately or constructed (if they meet the recognition criteria for development costs) are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as on the date of combination. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment write-offs. Expenditures incurred for internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and are charged against profits in the year in which they are incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed by the Group to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the income statement in the expense

category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and those that are not in use are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, are adjusted with effect from the beginning of the financial year that has just ended.
Research and development costs Research costs are presented in the profit and loss account as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. Following the initial recognition, the historical cost model is applied, which requires the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the period of expected future sales from the related project.
The carrying amount of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use, or more frequently when an indication of impairment is identified during the reporting period, which may suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

A summary of the policies applied to the Group's intangible assets is as follows:

Customer relationship

Trademarks

Licences and Software

Useful lives Method of amortisation Internally generated or acquired
Impairment testing

10 years 10 years on a straight-line basis Acquired Annual assesment to determine whether there is any indication that an assets may be impaired

Indefinite Not amortised Acquired
Annualy and where an indication of impairment exists

2-5 years 2-5 years on a straight-line basis Acquired Annual assesment to determine whether there is any indication that an assets may be impaired

After analyzing the relevant factors, for trademarks Group does not define the limit of its useful life. The intention of the Group is to operate for an indefinite period under the same trademark and it is believed that it will not become impaired. Consequently, and in accordance with IAS 38, the Group does not amortise intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Useful life of such resources should be reviewed in each reporting

period, in order to determine whether events and circumstances continue to confirm the assumption of the indefinite useful life of this asset.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the income statement when the asset is derecognized.

9.5.1. Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of:
 The sum of:
- payment transferred, - the amount of all non-controlling shares in the entity
being acquired and - in case of combination of entities performed in
stages, the fair value of shares being acquired which previously belonged to the acquired entity, as on the date of acquisition,
 over the net amount set as on the day of
acquisition of the identifiable value of assets and liabilities acquired. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is not amortised.

As on the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination. Each unit, or set of units, to which the goodwill has been allocated should:

 represent the lowest level within the Group at which

the goodwill

is monitored for internal

management purposes, and

 be not greater than a single operating segment, on

the basis of IFRS 8 "Operating segments".

Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the

recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which

the goodwill has been allocated. Where the recoverable

amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the

carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. If

goodwill represents part of a cash-generating unit and

part of the operations within that unit is disposed of, the

goodwill associated with the operations disposed of is

included in the carrying amount of the operations when

determining gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Goodwill disposed of in such circumstances is measured on the basis of the relative value of the
9.5.2. Emission rights
The Group operating as a business entity owns power plants and for this reason it holds emission rights which are used during the course of its business operations. The group applies the net liability method to recognize emission rights in its books. This means that the rights originally acquired free of charge are recognized in the balance sheet at the "zero" acquisition cost and the provision for the Group obligation to redeem an appropriate number of emission rights is created when the deficit in the emission rights held is ascertained. In the case of emission rights acquired to cover future deficit, such rights are initially recognized at acquisition cost among other intangible assets. Provision for the deficit of emission rights is measured then in accordance with the value of intangibles acquired. Provision is recognized based on the annual limit of emission rights.
Policy for CER/EUA swap transactions
The Group enters into forward swap agreements ("EUA/CER swaps") with third parties to exchange the rights to emit CO2 within European Union Emission
9.5.3. Cogeneration certificates
The Group as an entity producing electric energy in cogeneration receives "yellow certificates" of origin. Revenues from these certificates are recognized as decrease of cost in the moment of production and valued at current market prices provided the market for

operations disposed of and the value of the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Allowances ("EUA") at a future date (prior to the date at which the utility needs to satisfy its obligation for that period) for the same quantity of Certified Emission Reductions ("CER"). If the EUA/CER swap is entered into and will continue to be held to use CER for covering own liabilities for write-off of the emission rights (i.e., to satisfy obligations resulting from the emission of CO2), it is outside the scope of IAS 39.
Accounting when cash is received If the cash is received before the EUA/CER swap matures deferred income is recognized in respect of that amount as the EUA has not been delivered on that date.
Accounting for the EUA/CER exchange at maturity The CER are recognized at their fair value. Any difference between (i) the total of the cash received and the fair value of the CER received and (ii) the historical value of the EUA given up is recognized as a gain (or loss). Any deferred income is recognized in the income statement, as part of this gain (or loss).
such certificates is active. Otherwise, revenues are recognized upon sale of certificates. The value of certificates is recognized under intangible assets. Details concerning the certificates received in the current year were presented in note 43.

9.6. Leases
Group as lessee Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease

at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges

PLN thousand

and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease and subsequent lease payments are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

9.7. Impairment of non-financial assets
An assessment is made on each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that a nonfinancial non-current asset may be impaired. If such indication exists, or in case an annual impairment testing is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of that asset or the cash generating unit that the asset is a part of.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of the asset's or cashgenerating unit's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income

statement in the expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made on each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement. After a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, the depreciation (amortisation) charge for the asset is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

9.8. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment, investment properties, intangible assets and finished goods. Borrowing costs include interest calculated using the effective interest

method, finance charges in respect of finance leases and foreign exchange differences incurred in connection with the external financing to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.

9.9. Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into one of the following categories:
 financial assets held to maturity,  financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,  loans and receivables,  financial assets available for sale
Financial assets held to maturity
Financial assets held to maturity are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold until maturity, other than:
 those that upon initial recognition are designated as
at fair value through profit or loss;
 those that are designated as available for sale; and  those that meet the definition of loans and
receivables.
Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Financial assets held to maturity are classified as non-current assets if they are falling due within more than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
A financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is a financial asset that meets either of the following conditions:
a) it is classified as held for trading. A financial asset is classified as held for trading if it is:
 acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in
the near term;
 part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments
that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

 a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial
guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument), b) According to IAS 39 upon initial recognition it is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, which takes into account their market value as on the balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of these instruments is taken to finance costs or finance income. When a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives, the entire hybrid contract may be designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss, except where the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows or it is clear that separation of the embedded derivative is prohibited.
Financial assets may be designated at initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss if the following criteria are met;
 the designation eliminates or significantly reduces
the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or recognizing gains or losses on them on a different basis; or
 the assets are part of a group of financial assets
which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a document risk management strategy, or
 the financial asset contains an embedded derivative
that would need to be separately recorded.
As on 31st December 2011 the Group designated the hedging instruments as measured at fair value through profit and loss, further described in the note 39 to the consolidated annual report for year 2011.
Loans and receivables

PLN thousand

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. These are classified as current assets, provided their maturity does not exceed 12 months after the balance sheet date. Loans and receivables with maturities exceeding 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified under non-current assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those nonderivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any of the three preceding categories.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value, without deducting transaction costs, and taking into account their market value as on the balance sheet date. Where no quoted market price is available and there is no possibility to determine their fair value using alternative methods, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at cost, adjusted for any impairment

losses. Positive and negative differences between the fair value and acquisition cost, net of deferred tax, of financial assets available for sale (if quoted market price determined on the regulated market is available or if the fair value can be determined using other reliable method), are taken to the other comprehensive income. Any decrease in the value of financial assets available for sale resulting from impairment losses is taken to the income statement and recorded under finance cost.
Purchase and sale of financial assets is recognized at the transaction date. Initially, financial assets are recognized at acquisition cost, i.e. at fair value plus, for financial assets other than classified as financial assets as at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are able to be attributed directly to the acquisition.
Financial assets are derecognized if the Group loses its control over contractual rights attached to those assets, which usually takes place upon sale of the asset or where all cash flows attributed to the given asset are transferred to an independent third party.

9.10. Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

9.10.1. Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced directly. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in profit or loss.

The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included on a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an

impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment
9.10.2. Financial assets carried at cost

9.10.3. Available-for-sale financial assets
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an available-for-sale asset, then the amount of the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal payment and interest) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in the profit or loss, is removed from equity and recognized in the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on equity instruments classified as available for sale cannot be

recognized in the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in the income statement.

9.11. Embedded derivatives

Embedded derivatives are bifurcated from host contracts and treated as derivative financial instruments if all of the following conditions are met:

 the economic characteristics and risks of

embedded derivatives are not closely related to

those of the host contract,

 a separate instrument with the same terms as

embedded derivative would meet the definition of a

derivative,



the hybrid instrument is not recorded at fair

value with gains and losses taken to profit or loss.

Embedded derivatives are recognized in a similar manner to that of separate instruments, which have not been designated as hedging instruments.
The extent to which, in accordance with IAS 39, the economic characteristics and risks of foreign currency embedded derivatives are closely related to those of the host contract covers circumstances where the currency of the host contract is also the common currency of purchase or sale of non-financial items on the market of a given transaction.
The Group assesses whether embedded derivatives are required to be separated from host contracts at its initial recognition. In case of embedded derivatives acquired

Page 83 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2011

PLN thousand

as part of business combination, the Group does not reassess the embedded derivatives as on the combination

date (they are assessed upon initial recognition by the acquired company).

9.12. Derivative financial instruments and hedges

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against the risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations such as forward currency contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when its value is positive and as liabilities when its value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the net profit or loss for the period.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values of similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
 fair value hedges, when hedging the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or
 cash flow hedges, when hedging exposure to
variability in cash flows that is attributable to a

particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a forecast transaction, or
 hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Hedges of foreign currency risk in an unrecognized firm commitment are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure to changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis to check if the hedge is highly effective throughout all financial reporting periods for which it was designated.

9.12.1. Fair value hedges

Fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. In the case of a fair value hedge, any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item, the hedging instrument is re-measured to fair value

and the gains and losses on the hedging instrument and hedged item are recognized in profit or loss.
For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment to carrying amount is amortised through the income statement over the remaining term to maturity.
When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group 

Page 84 of 152

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2011

PLN thousand

hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in profit or loss. The changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognized in profit or loss.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge

accounting, or the Group revokes the designation. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss. Amortization may begin as soon as an adjustment is made, however no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.

9.12.2. Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are hedges securing for danger of cash flows fluctuations which can be attributed to a particular kind of risk connected with the given item of assets or a liability or with a planned investment of high probability, and which could influence profit or loss. The part of profit or loss connected with the hedging instrument which constitutes effective hedge is recognized directly in other comprehensive income and the non-effective part is recognized in profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the associated gains or losses that were recognized directly in equity shall be reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a nonfinancial liability, or a forecast transaction for a nonfinancial asset or non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, then gains and losses that were recognized directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.

If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of non-financial asset or non-financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or financial liability becomes a firm commitment, which will apply fair value hedge, then the gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the non-financial asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity remains recognized in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognized in equity is taken to net profit or loss for the period.

9.13. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each inventory item to its present location and conditions are

accounted for as follows for both the current and previous year:

Raw materials
Finished goods and work-in-progres Goods for resale

purchased cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis
cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity, excluding borrowing costs purchased cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of

completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

9.14. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, the value of receivables is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows to present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, any increase in the balance due to the passage of time is recognized as finance income.

Other receivables include prepayments for future purchases of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories. Prepayments are recognized in accordance with the character of underlying assets, i.e. under non-current or current assets. As non-monetary assets, advances are not discounted.
Receivables from public authorities are presented within other non-financial assets, except for company income tax receivables that constitute a separate item in the balance sheet.

9.15. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.

9.16. Interest-bearing loans, borrowings and bonds

All loans, borrowings and bonds are initially recognized at the fair value less transaction costs associated with the borrowing.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any transaction costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and bonds are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Gains and losses are recognized in net profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest rate method.

9.17. Trade and other payables
Short-term trade payables are carried at the amount due and payable.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial liabilities may be designated at initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss if the following criteria are met:
 the designation eliminates or significantly reduces
the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the liabilities or recognizing gains or losses on them on a different basis; or
 the liabilities are part of a group of financial liabilities
which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a document risk management strategy; or
 financial liability contains an embedded derivative
that would need to be separately recorded.
As on 31st December 2011 no financial liabilities were classified to fair value through profit and loss category (as on 31st December 2010: nil).

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, reflecting their market value at the balance sheet date less directly attributable transaction costs. Gains or losses on these liabilities are recognized in the income statement as finance income or cost.
Financial liabilities other than financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement.
Other non-financial liabilities include, in particular, liabilities to the tax office in respect of value added tax, advance payment liabilities which will be settled by way of delivery of goods or services, or fixed assets. Other non-financial liabilities are recognized at the amount due.

9.18. Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of the provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The

expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows to present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as finance cost.

9.19. Retirement benefits
In accordance with internal remuneration regulations, employees of Group companies are entitled to retirement benefits. Retirement benefits are paid out as one-off benefit upon retirement. The amount of those benefits depends on the number of years of employment and the employee's average salary. The Group makes a provision for retirement benefits in order to allocate the costs of those allowances to the periods to which they relate. In accordance with IAS 19 retirement benefits are post-employment defined benefits. The carrying amount of the Group's liabilities resulting from those benefits is calculated at each balance sheet date by an independent actuary. The balance of these liabilities equals discounted payments which will be made in the

future and accounts for staff turnover, and relates to the period to the balance sheet date. Demographic information and information on staff turnover are based on historical information.
On the basis of valuations carried out by professional actuarial companies, the Group creates a provision for future benefits according to the concept of the "corridor". If the net value of accumulated unrecognized actuarial gains or losses at the end of prior reporting period exceeds 10% of the present value of the liability from defined benefit plans at that date, then a part of actuarial gains or losses is recorded by the Group in the income statement.

9.20. Revenue
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenues are recognized at the fair value of the consideration received
9.20.1. Sale of goods
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the

or receivable, net of Value Added Tax, excise duty and discounts. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized.
buyer and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.

9.20.2. Rendering of sales services
The trading companies within the group are rendering sales services to the paper mills. For these services they receive a commission income based on the actual sales of products on each particular market. This means that

the income for rendering of services is recognized at the same time as the sales of goods. Only income from paper mills outside the group is presented as sales revenues.

9.20.3. Interest

Revenue is recognized as interest accrues (using the effective interest method that is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the

expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

9.20.4. Dividends

Revenue is recognized when the shareholders' rights to receive the payment are established.

9.20.5. Rental income (operating lease)
Rental income arising on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.

9.20.6. Government grants
Government grants are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the period necessary to

match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, its fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released systematically to the income statement over the estimated useful life of the relevant asset by way of equal annual installments.

9.21. Income tax

9.21.1. Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
9.21.2. Deferred tax
For financial reporting purposes deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on all temporary differences on the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts recognized in the financial statements.

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences:
 except where the deferred income tax liability arises
from the initial recognition of goodwill, an asset or

liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 in respect of taxable temporary differences
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized:
 except where the deferred tax asset relating to the
deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 in respect of deductible temporary differences
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit

will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed on each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available that will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as on the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognized out of profit or loss is recorded out of income statement: in other comprehensive income it related to positions recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset by the Group only if legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

9.21.3. Deferred tax relating to operations in the Special Economic Zone

The Group operates in the Kostrzynsko ­ Slubicka Special Economic Zone and due to this fact it benefits from a tax relief to the amount of the investment expenditure made.
Where the investment expenditure is not covered by the revenue earned in the given fiscal year, then the Group recognizes a deferred tax asset against the discounted

excess of the investment expenditure over revenue earned, in accordance with the Decree of the Council of Ministers dated 14th September 2004 concerning the Kostrzynsko ­ Slubicka Special Economic Zone (Official Journal no.222 item 2252 dated 13th October 2004).

9.21.4. Value added tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of value added tax except:
 when the value added tax incurred on a purchase
of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case value added tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable;
9.21.5. Excise tax
The amount of excise tax due in respect of the electric energy produced is recognized in income statement in the period to which it relates and in the balance sheet under liabilities.

taxable income has been earned
and
 receivables and payables, which are stated with the
amount of value added tax included. The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
The excise tax on the energy used for own needs is recognized among costs of sales in the income statement.

9.22. Earnings per share
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period by the weighted average number of shares during the reporting period.

The Group does not present diluted earnings per share, as there are no potential ordinary shares with dilutive effect.

10. Operating segments
The principal business of the Group is paper production, which is produced in four paper mills:
 Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. (Poland) ­ production of
high-quality uncoated fine paper under the brand Amber, with a production capacity of about 275,000 tons per year;
 Arctic Paper Munkedals AB (Sweden) ­ produces
high-quality uncoated fine paper under the brand Munken, with a production capacity of about 160,000 tons per year;
 Arctic Paper Mochenwangen GmbH (Germany) ­
produces uncoated wood containing offset papers under brands Pamo, & L-Print, with a production

capacity of about 115,000 tons per year;
 Arctic Paper Grycksbo (Sweden) ­ production of
coated wood-free paper under brands G-Print and Arctic, annual production capacity of 265,000 tons.
Hitherto the Group presented business segments divided into production units. However, considering the changes which take place on the paper market and which are made in each paper mill it was decided to the change of reported business segments.
Starting from 1st January 2011 the Group identifies three business segments:

Arctic Paper S.A. Capital Group

 Uncoated paper ­ paper for printing or other
graphic purposes, including wood-free and woodcontaining. Uncoated wood-free paper can be manufactured from various types of pulp, with different filler content, and can undergo various finishing enhancing processes, such as surface sizing and calendering. Two main categories of this type of paper are graphic paper (used for example for printing books and catalogues) and office papers (for instance, photocopy paper, however the Group currently does not produce office papers. Uncoated paper from mechanical pulp intended for printing or other graphic purposes. This type of paper is used for printing magazines with the use of rotogravure or offset printing techniques. The Group's products in this segment are usually used for printing paperbacks.
 Coated paper - wood-free paper for printing or
other graphic purposes, one-side or two-side coated with mixtures containing mineral pigments, such as china clay, calcium carbonate, etc. The coating process can involve different methods, both online and offline, and can be supplemented by super-calandering to ensure a smooth surface. Coating improves the printing quality of photographs and illustrations.
 Other ­ this segment contains results of distribution
and sales companies as well as business of Arctic Paper S.A.
The division of business segments to uncoated and coated paper is caused by the following circumstances:

 Demand for products and its supply, as well as the
products prices sold on the market are shaped by factors characteristic for each segment, including i.e. level of the production capacity in each segment,
 Key operational factors such as e.g. orders inflow
or production costs level are determined by factors which are close to each other within each paper segment,
 Products manufactured in the Group's paper mills
can be, with some exceptions, allocated to production in different subsidiaries within the same paper segment, which to some extent disturbs the financial results of each paper mill,
 Arctic Paper Group results are dominated by global
market trends in terms of fluctuations of prices of paper and basic raw materials, particularly pulp, and depend on individual conditions of production subsidiaries to lesser extent,
 The changed business segments division will allow
better comparability of Arctic Paper Group results to other companies of paper industry.
The results of paper mills and other entities are monthly analyzed by the Group's key management personnel based on internal reporting. Performance is measured based on the EBITDA level.
Transfer prices in transactions between segments are set on an arm's length basis as if it concerned non related parties.

Unrecognized deferred tax asset relates mainly to those tax losses, which are expected to expire rather than to be realised, and temporary differences, which based on the Group's management assessment could not be utilized for tax purposes.

The Polish tax system has restrictive provisions for grouping of tax losses for multiple legal entities under common control, such as those of the Group. Thus, each of the Group's subsidiaries may only utilize its own tax losses to offset taxable income in subsequent years.

Deferred tax asset is recognized for tax losses carried forward to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.

The amounts and expiry dates of unused tax losses are as follows:

25. Impairment test of tangible and intangible assets

As on 31st December 2011 the Group performed impairment test of tangible and intangible assets in the paper mill Arctic Paper Mochenwangen.
The performance of the test in Arctic Paper Mochenwangen was connected with achieving by the mill a lower result than expected by the management of the Group. This was influenced by market conditions such as increase of raw materials prices, strengthening of competition in the segment of paper produced by Mochenwangen mill.
In respect of the above, a decision had been made to perform a test on impairment using discounted cash flows method. The performed test resulted in creating an allowance on the grounds of impairment to the amount of PLN 11,021 thousand (PLN 16,186 thousand in 2010). The description of the process as well as key assumptions have been presented as below.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit selling AP Tech, L-Print and Pamo paper has been determined based on the value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved

by the key management covering a five-year period from 2012 ­ 2016. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 9.80% and the cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 1.0% growth rate.
Key Assumptions used in value in use calculations
The calculation of value in use for Arctic Paper Mochenwangen cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the following factors:
 Discount rates  Increase in sales prices  Increase in energy prices  Currency risk
Discount rate represents the assessment made by the management of the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. The discount rate is used by the management to assess the operating efficiency (results) and future investment propositions. In the budgeted period the discount rate amounts to 8.40%. The discount rate was

Consolidated Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2011 Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2011

determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Increase in raw material prices (primarily prices of pulp) assessments of change in raw materials prices are made using the ratios published based on the data regarding pulp prices. The main source of data used as a base for assumptions is Internet site: www.foex.fi. It should be mentioned that pulp prices are featured with high volatility. Increase in energy prices - increase in energy prices, in particular coal which is a basic source of the energy,

results from the assumptions used in the projections approved by the local management of Arctic Paper Mochenwangen.
Currency risk - the risk relates to the purchase cost of raw materials used for production of paper, in particular to the purchase of pulp where costs are incurred mainly in USD. In projected period the USD/EUR exchange rate was set at the level of 0.7194.

26. Employees benefits

26.1. Employee share incentive plan
On 30th July 2009 the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting adopted Resolution Number 4 on approving the assumptions of an incentive programme for key managers, issuing subscription warrants, entitling them to take up D Series shares excluding the preemptive rights.

Until 31st December 2011 there were agreements regarding acquiring these warrants executed to dispense 365 thousand warrants. Until the date of preparing of the consolidated financial statements none of the entitled persons has exercised the right to payable conversion of the warrants to the Company's shares.

26.2. Retirement and other post-employment benefits

The Group companies provide retirement benefits to retiring employees in accordance with the Labor Code in Poland applicable to Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. and agreements with labor unions applicable to Arctic Paper Munkedals AB and Arctic Paper Mochenwangen GmbH. Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. and Arctic Paper Grycksbo AB also operate Social Funds for future retirees.
As a result, based on the valuation made by professional actuarial companies in each country, the Group have created a provision for these future commitments.

The Group recognizes these provisions in accordance with the corridor method. According to this method, actuarial gains or losses are only recognized if, at the end of the previous reporting period, they exceed 10% of the present value of the obligation.
Net pension costs for the defined benefit plans are summarized in the following table:

30.5. Retained earnings and limits to its distribution

Retained earnings in consolidated financial statements may include amounts that are not subject to distribution i.e. cannot be distributed in the form of dividend. Statutory financial statements of Group subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with local national accounting standards (except of Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A.) and companies' articles of association. Dividends may be distributed to the parent company based on the net profits in the local financial statements prepared for statutory purposes. Such local definition of retained earnings available for distribution are very often different from the definition of retained earnings in accordance with IFRS, which can be one factor of limitation of profit distribution. For example, local legal regulations often require certain reserve capital to be created of profits for possible future losses. Different accounting policies might also create different results between statutory local accounts and accounts for consolidation purposes.
Dividends may be distributed based on the net profit reported in the standalone annual financial statements of Arctic Paper S.A. prepared for statutory purposes.

In accordance with the provisions of the Code of Commercial Companies, the parent company is required to create reserve capital for possible losses. Transferred to this capital category is 8% of profit for the given financial year recognized in the standalone financial statements of the parent company until such time as the balance of the reserve capital reaches at least one third of the share capital of the parent company. Appropriation of the reserve capital and other reserves depends on the decision of the General Meeting of Shareholders; however, the reserve capital in the amount of one third of the share capital may be used solely for the absorption of losses reported in the standalone financial statements of the parent company ad shall not be used for any other purpose.
Retained earnings/Accumulated losses presented in the balance sheet as on 31st December 2011 consist of the following items:
a) Accumulated losses in the amount of PLN -10,358 thousand.

35.1. Legal claims
The case against PGNiG S.A On 26th August 2010 Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. filed a lawsuit to determine the price for fuel gas sold to Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. by PGNiG S.A. The case was examined by Arbitrary Court to the Polish Chamber of Commerce. The claim was based on the provisions of the agreement concluded by and between Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. and PGNiG S.A., which allows, in case of gas prices increase more that 10% in the particular contractual year, to apply for negotiations and further to address the case to be decided by the Arbitrary Court. The case was ended with an unfavorable decision for Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A.
The case against Cezex Sp. z o.o. On 8th October 2009 and on 27th November 2009 Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. filed a claim against Cezex Sp. z o.o. with the District Court in Gorzów Wielkopolski.
The value of the dispute includes respectively:
 the principal of PLN 11,240 thousand and interest of
PLN 325 thousand accrued until the date of filing the claim,
 the principal of PLN 174 thousand and interest
accrued in the amount of PLN 2 thousand. The case pertains to the failure of Cezex Sp. z o.o. to pay its liability to Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. for the

purchase of goods in the period from 11th February 2009 to 1st July 2009. Receivables from Cezex Sp. z o.o. were secured in favor of Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. by mortgage on the counterparty's real property. Moreover, an allowance for doubtful debts was established for their entire value.
On 21st December 2009 the court declared bankruptcy of Cezex Sp. z o.o. with an option of concluding a settlement by the parties. According to the initial settlement proposals, amounts due to Arctic Paper Kostrzyn S.A. will be covered by a separate agreement providing for their full repayment, because the receivables secured with mortgage on the real property owned by Cezex Sp. z o. o. are not covered by the settlement. On 18th May 2011 the Court declared the liquidation bankruptcy of Cezex Sp. z o.o. As a result of the bankrupt complaint, the Court cancelled the decision from 18th May 2011. On 7th February 2012, the District Court declared the liquidation bankruptcy of Cezex Sp. z o.o again.
As on 31st December 2011 the Group has established an allowance for doubtful debts for the full value of receivables from Cezex Sp. z o.o.
The case against Jakon SA in liquidation On 15th April 2010 a lawsuit was filed against Jakon SA in liquidation and Jan Dziedzic, the lawsuit includes a

claim of Arctic Paper Kostrzyn SA against Jakon SA in liquidation.
The claim concerns the total receivable amounting to PLN 2,004 thousand. This claim is secured by a mortgage on the property of a guarantor Mr Jan Dziedzic to the amount of PLN 2,000 thousand. On 7th February 2011 a bankruptcy liquidation of Jakon S.A. was announced. Currently there are proceedings held against Jan Dziedzic as a guarantor. The Court issued

the payment order in the writ-of-payment proceedings, there was an objection raised by the defendant, the case is still in progress.
As on 31st December 2011 the Group made allowance for doubtful debts for full amount of receivables from Jakon S.A. in liquidation.
As on 31st December 2011 the companies of the Group are not parties to any other lawsuits.

35.2. Tax settlements
Tax settlements, together with other areas of legal compliance (e.g. customs or foreign exchange law) are subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities, which are entitled to impose severe fines, penalties and interest charges. The lack of reference to well established regulations in Poland results in a lack of clarity and integrity in the regulations. Frequent contradictions in legal interpretations both within government bodies and between companies and government bodies create uncertainties and conflicts. These facts create tax risks in Poland that are

substantially more significant than those typically found in countries with more developed tax systems.
Tax authorities may examine the accounting records within up to five years after the end of the year in which the final tax payments were to be made. Consequently, the Group may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which may arise as a result of additional tax audits. In Group's opinion as on 31st December 2011 proper provision was created to cover recognized and countable tax risk.

receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group assesses and recognizes all receivables which are not overdue and which are not subject to impairment write-downs as recoverable.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash

equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

38.5. Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. This tool considers the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivables, other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of

various sources of financing, such as bank overdrafts, bank loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities as on 31st December 2011 and 31st December 2010 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

On 1st December 2008 Artic Paper Mochenwangen GmbH (AP MW) carried out a swap of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) in exchange of European Union Emission Allowances (EUAs). In this swap, AP MW received 100,000 CERs and EUR 776 thousand in cash in exchange of 100,000 EUAs which were received (granted) from the government.
On 1st December 2008 AP MW sold 100,000 CERs received in the transaction described above to a bank

(Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, Munich) for EUR 2,200 thousand. AP MW is obliged to repurchase 100,000 CERs on 30th March 2011 at EUR 2,430 thousand (Maturity SWAP CER/CER). Since AP MW is obliged to repurchase 100.000 CERs for a fixed price there has been no transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of the CERs to the bank. Due to this fact AP MW has not recognized the revenue from the sale (IAS 18.14). The cash received (EUR 2,200 thousand) was

recorded as a non-current interest bearing loan. The 100.000 CERs are recognized as intangible assets at cost (fair value of the CERs at date of transaction). During 2011 AP MW repurchased and sold 100,000 CERs.
As a consequence of recognition of emission rights granted to Mochenwangen as a result of purchase price

allocation, as on 31st December 2008 the Group recognized provision for actual consumption of CO2 in the amount of PLN 7,706 thousand. Provision as on 31st December 2011 amounted to PLN 7,858 thousand compared to PLN 6,922 thousand as on 31st December 2010.

43. Cogeneration certificates
Based on the provisions of article 91 paragraph 1 point 1 of the act dated 10th April 1997, Energy Law, the Company obtained property rights to the Certificates of Origin being the confirmation of the amount of energy produced in the heavy duty (high performance) cogeneration unit using the gas fuels.
The change in law since 10th September 2011 modified the subject of granting the certificates for electricity produced from purchased heat and from gas.
Before the changes were introduced for the total energy produced yellow certificates had been granted. After the change, yellow certificates are only for electricity produced from gas, while for electricity produced from purchased heat red certificates are being granted.

Due to producing electric energy in cogeneration, in 2011 the Group received the rights in the amount of: yellow certificates kWh 154,604,654 and red certificates 70,578,470 kWh (in 2010 kWh 219,420,350). In 2011, revenues from sale of cogeneration certificates amounted to PLN 19,143 thousand (in 2010 PLN 26,890 thousand). The certificates of cogeneration corresponding to the energy produced are recognized as reduction of cost of sales in the income statement.
The changes in law may cause the certificates originally recognized and valued as yellow to be accounted as red certificates of lesser value.
For that reason, the Company made accruals (liabilities) in proper amount.

44. Government grants and subsidies
