THE BONDUELLE GROUP

Interview with Guillaume Debrosse, Chief Executive Officer of the Bonduelle Group

1.1 Interview with Guillaume Debrosse, Chief Executive Officer of the Bonduelle Group - GRI 102-10, 102-14 (1)

In Western countries, consumers continue to expect healthier, plant-based food. At the same time, the agricultural and industrial sectors have faced challenges. Can you give us details of the challenges that arose during 2018-2019?
Plant-based food is becoming increasingly popular, with consumers looking for safer, healthier food which is affordable and environmentally friendly. For us, this is a tremendous opportunity for growth and has permeated the development and innovation projects in each of our markets. Our brand market share is growing and our ranges are expanding. This is evidenced by the launch of our range of Bonduelle no pesticides residue products, our organic ranges, pulse-based products, and convenient, healthy meal solutions such as ready-to-eat salad bowls containing pulses, grains and seeds.
"Plant-based food is becoming increasingly popular. For us, this is a real opportunity for growth."
However, we also had to contend with various negative factors in 2018-2019. First, adverse weather conditions affected the harvest in several production areas in 2018 (sowing was delayed by heavy rains, which were followed by a series of heatwaves). This impact, which pushed our production costs up, was compounded by trade wars between countries and tensions on labor markets in the United States and in some European countries. This hampered our ability to reflect this inflation in our prices, at a time when the retail environment is undergoing profound changes and the boundaries between retail and food service are blurring.
Consequently, the Bonduelle Group's revenue in 2018-2019 totaled 2,777.1 million euros, virtually unchanged from the previous fiscal year. Current operating profitability stood at 123.7 million euros, on a par with last year's all-time record group profitability (123.6 million euros).

Obviously, this result reflects the different results in each region. What were the highlights in 2018-2019?
To give you more details, Europe ­ which accounts for 47% of the group's revenue ­ posted annual growth of 0.5%. The Bonduelle and Cassegrain brands continued to grow in the various segments, albeit in fairly stagnant markets. The group is building market share as a result of various plant-based innovations, combining vegetables, grains and pulses to meet different consumption opportunities.
Outside Europe, we recorded a 0.4% decrease in revenue for the 2018-2019 fiscal year. This change is due to a major client in the fresh vegetables segment in North America diversifying its sourcing from the second quarter, as well as rationalization of the product portfolio. At the same time, the region's canned and frozen vegetable segments saw robust growth, fueled both by internal growth and by the acquisition of the Del Monte brand in Canada, which is performing as expected.
Lastly, activity in the Eurasia region was extremely buoyant during the period due to the success of new product ranges such as baby sweet corn, jars of precooked vegetables and canned olives. This momentum will be bolstered next year by the frozen vegetable segment, produced locally following the acquisition of the plant in the Belgorod (Russia).

(1) Highlights of the year are presented in Section 4.1.7.

processing.

The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) is calling for far-reaching changes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and honor the Paris Climate Agreement. Bonduelle's strategy ties in with the move towards sustainable food, soil and water. Efforts to make food more productive and resilient to climate change must be coordinated with efforts to conserve and restore biodiversity and promote healthy food, while reducing food waste.
Bonduelle has also been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. We are renewing our commitment to uphold and implement its principles.
What forms does this take on the ground?
In real terms, together with our partner producers, we are factoring the impact of global warming into our agronomic decisions (growing areas, seed varieties (non-GMO), agroecological practices, technological inputs from precision agriculture). This approach is well under way and has already made it possible to mitigate impacts in some areas. We now need to make this systemic approach across all our production areas.
"Together with our partner producers, we are factoring the impact of global warming into our agronomic decisions."
We are adapting and taking steps to shoulder our share of responsibility in terms of global warming. For example, we have made a commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with the targets set by the international community under the Paris Climate Agreement (COP 21): our aim is to achieve a 20% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.
The group's new governance has been in place for a year now. What is your initial assessment of this reorganization?
Bonduelle is continuing to evolve in order to fulfill its ambition to be "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food". After a year of new governance, this has undoubtedly continued. The Chief Executive Board (CEB) and the Group Management Committee (GMC) have made good progress. While maintaining the principle of autonomy of our business units, this organization allows us to be more attuned to our markets and opportunities, facilitates the launch of cross-cutting initiatives and projects, accelerates the introduction of best practice, makes better use of our internal sources of performance, and improves overall

This applies to innovation, industrial projects, workplace safety and talent management, food safety, improving the recyclability of our packaging, searching for efficiency, synergy and savings via the TMO (Transformation Management Office) program and the management of key accounts.
You say that "the most exciting issues today are all found in industry, such as the digital and industrial revolution, consumer trends, products, etc." Is this compatible with Bonduelle's tagline, La nature, notre futur?
Yes, more than ever! Each of these revolutions directly supports our belief that nature is our future. They provide answers to the fundamental challenges of promoting plant-based food, People development and combating global warming and pollution.
At Bonduelle, the legitimacy of our agro-industrial model is rooted in the historical relationship with our partner farmers. We are involved in the agro-ecological transition alongside them. However, our ambition to be "the world reference in `wellliving' through plant-based food" means that we have a duty to go even further. This is why we are committed to obtaining B Corp (Benefit Corporation) certification. We subscribe to the philosophy of this certification: not to strive to be "the best company in the world, but the best for the world."
At the time of publication of this universal registration document, the certification body had completed its pre-assessment of the group. This enabled us to identify areas for improvement and define the certification process by a law firm. In several business units, a self-diagnosis is under way.
What are Bonduelle's prospects for 2019-2020?
In light of the uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic climate and the full year impacts of the previous year's significant events, we expect growth in revenue of between 1.5 and 2.5%(1) in 2019-2020. Current operational profitability is likely to range between 115 and 118 million euros(1).
Combining short-term initiatives with long-term programs, the group's transformation is under way. It is based on continued investments in plant-based innovation with the aim of improving our brands and responding to our customers' expectations. In upstream agricultural activities, it also draws on our fundamental sustainable and responsible industry model.
This transformation will combine business units' local subsidiarity and agility with maximization of our know-how and cross-cutting platforms. It will enable us to gradually return to the course set by our VegeGo! corporate strategy.

To be "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food"

1.3.1.1 Our manifesto: nature is our future
The history of the world is punctuated by key milestones. Driven by engaged and committed People wishing to build a better future, these transitions change behaviors, reshape relations with the world, and help us move forward.
Bonduelle believes it is time for a plant-based revolution, an inevitable sea change in the face of the immense challenges facing the planet (see 1.4.1 A changing world). The fact that there will be 9 billion men and women to feed in tomorrow's world has made plant-based food a major challenge for the well-being of future generations, in terms of both the quantities to be produced and the ways they are produced.
Nature is our most precious asset, and will not wait. We cannot remain blind to the warning signs, we must react. Climate change, soil depletion and biodiversity loss threaten to undermine the balance of nature and in turn that of humanity.

As a family-run company with a long-term vision, and responsible for feeding millions of consumers across the planet, we aim to be a committed player. The controlling Shareholders and employees of the Bonduelle Group are today committed to building a better future through plantbased food.
At Bonduelle, we believe that we must lead the way, offer innovative and pertinent solutions to feed people better while respecting the planet and thereby ensuring the wellbeing of future generations.
Since 1853, we have been working with our partners on all fronts to develop modern plant-based production that respects water, air, soil and subsoils. This is why we resolutely defend efficient, ecological, intelligent and supportive agro-industrial business, focused on healthy, safe, sustainable and accessible food.
We are committed and are innovating from field to plate to make a better future through plant-based food, because it is our firm belief that nature is our future.

1.4.1 A changing world
1.4.1.1 Climate change and population growth
According to forecasts by scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the rise in the overall temperature of the Earth's surface could reach an additional 1 °C to 5 °C by the end of the 21st century. Global warming and the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will have wide-ranging consequences, the effects of which ­ although certain effects are not entirely clear at present ­ will inevitably have an impact on the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors. These will include an increase in the number of extreme weather events (droughts and floods), the destabilization of ecosystems, and implications for biodiversity and soil life, with the spread of pests encouraged by the rising temperatures and lower yields for many crops.
The world's human population continues to grow, with estimates converging on the figure of 9 billion people on Earth by 2050. The need to feed these 9 billion people, particularly in a context of global climate change, requires an energy and agro-ecological transition to take place within our society.

1.4.1.2 The vital energy and agro-ecological transition
Agro-ecology aims at transforming agriculture and developing food systems to make them more sustainable. It proposes modifying production methods to optimize their productivity whilst increasing their capacity to withstand climate change and the volatility of agricultural and food prices. Agro-ecology also aims to maximize the eco-friendly services supplied by agro-systems and to limit their negative impacts, in particular, by reducing dependency on fossil fuels. It takes the form of a logical series of agricultural practices that enhance ecological processes and biodiversity. As such, agro-ecology consists of designing agricultural production systems based on the functionalities offered by natural ecosystems. It extends these functionalities (e.g.: combats erosion and stimulates soil biodiversity by means of plant cover and no-till farming, water purification and the provision of areas of refuge for auxiliary insects and strips of land for growing bee-friendly flowers, etc.) with the aim of reducing environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, use of synthetic fertilizers and phytosanitary products, etc.) and preserving natural resources (water, energy, biodiversity, minerals, etc.).
The energy transition seeks to turn the current energy model into a new energy model based on renewable resources. For industrial players, it is a question of transforming production models to improve energy efficiency and of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In addition to these challenges, farmers need to switch to biomass boilers in order to generate so-called renewable energy for heating and electricity.

1.4.2.1 The essential consumer requirements remain: quality, health and safety
The food sector is the sector in which consumers pay most attention to quality. Indeed, 74% of French people(1) consider it a priority. This reinforces the issue of product transparency. More than a third of French people tend to check the ingredients list before buying. The presentation of the ingredients and the cultivation or production method is becoming clearer and more detailed. More and more packaging is literally transparent, which offers consumers reassurance. Traceability initiatives are emerging, such as the use of blockchain and the release of applications (the Yuka app scans and deciphers food labels for consumers, for example).
1.4.2.2 From demand to supply: the growth of organic produce
Seen as healthier, organic vegetables are now an integral part of the shopping habits of Europeans and Americans. In 2018, 19% of the vegetables sold in Europe were organic, compared with 13.5% in 2015.
The distribution networks for organic produce are growing: mass-market retailing is expanding its organic ranges, the number of organic stores is rising steadily, and organic produce is increasingly available online. While there are differences between regions globally, farms are gradually switching to organic farming. At the end of 2016, organic farms (certified and in the process of switching) accounted for more than 6.2% of European agricultural land and 1.1% of the world's total agricultural land(2).

1.4.2.4 Growing awareness of the issue of food waste
One-third of the world's food production for human consumption is lost or wasted. This is equivalent to around 1.3 billion tonnes per year(3). Of this food waste, 45% consists of fruit and vegetables. In recent years, several retailers have launched initiatives to tackle food waste, such as the sale of "imperfect" fruit and vegetables, on-site transformation of damaged fruit and vegetables into prepared dishes, and raising consumer awareness.
1.4.2.5 New ways to eat vegetables
Consumers are eager for solutions and recipes to help them eat more vegetables. Meal kits (salads, wraps) sold in stores and their delivery services are expanding. Online shopping is continuing to see strong growth. However, consumers still like to see and handle fresh produce. In-store availability thus remains an important factor for shoppers.
1.4.2.6 Outlook: the plant-based food market will continue to grow
The plant-based food market is expanding, and will continue to grow in the coming years. Two recently introduced segments demonstrate this: plant-based proteins and ready-to-eat prepared plant-based food. The global plant-based protein market, with average annual growth of 5.5%, is expected to reach 11 billion euros by 2020(4). The global market segment of ready-to-eat prepared plant-based food is expected to grow by 25% per year until 2020(4).

1.4.2.3 Major retailers turn to local producers
In addition to their health, consumers are considering the environmental impact of their food. The initial response has been a move towards shorter supply chains. This trend, initiated by small producers and social start-ups, has been taken up by the major players, notably by creating collection points for fruit and vegetable baskets in the form of lockers, a service that can be extended to businesses.

2.2.1 CSR: using Bonduelle's agro-industrial model to accelerate the agro-ecological transition
2
2.2.1.1 Editorial ­ GRI 102-10, 102-14

"The climate emergency and the need for a more circular economy that has a smaller environmental impact mean that collectively we face major responsibilities. Bonduelle, as a corporate citizen and agro-industrial player, wants to play a proactive part.
The group's agro-industrial model legitimizes it on this path. For decades now, Bonduelle has chosen to base its vegetable supplies on close partnerships with 3,100 farmers. These partnerships enable it to conduct its agro-ecological transition by testing and developing alternative farming practices, specifically designed to protect soil life, the only way to ensure its resilience in the face of the changes to come. In 2018-2019, Bonduelle confirmed this longstanding, committed approach by launching three salad products and one sweet corn product with no pesticides residue.

In 2018, Bonduelle set about bringing a new dimension to its CSR commitments, by beginning the B Corp certification process. Its target is to cover 100% of revenue within by 2025. This is a holistic approach focused on continued improvement and is extremely exacting, but crucially very inspiring for the group's employees.
In 2018, a new Steering Committee focused on six priority topics redefined tangible targets for each pillar of its CSR approach: climate change, relationships with farmers, packaging, accessibility and sustainable food, employees and B Corp. certification 2019-2020 will focus on monitoring the action plans.
All of these approaches are part of Bonduelle's plan to be better for the world, not the best in the world."
Anne-Sophie Fontaine, Head of CSR and external communications.

2.2.1.2 An approach that focuses on five macro-objectives ­ GRI 102-14, 103-1, 102-46, 102-10
Bonduelle is a family-owned company established in 1853 that produces ready-to-use and ready-to-eat vegetables. It has a commercial presence in over 100 countries and operates or owns 56 agro-industrial production sites. Its growth is based on two fundamental pillars: respect for nature ­ essential for a group whose business activity is directly linked to the land every single day ­ and its drive to place humans at the heart of a long-term corporate strategy. This project aims to offer the best that nature can provide, guided by ethical principles formulated by seven generations of Shareholders.
Bonduelle has been a pioneer in these crucial areas of sustainability and CSR; this spirit is reflected in the targets set by the group's family Shareholders: sustainability, independence and the individual development of our employees. Since 1996, the group has also had an agronomic sourcing charter in place with its producer partners to ensure

optimum production conditions and the best product quality, while protecting the land.
With the intention of responding even better to society's expectations while formalizing its approach, the Bonduelle Group decided in 2002-2003 to step up its CSR actions by setting up a dedicated Steering Committee.
"We have two objectives in our DNA, as family Shareholders: respect for the natural environment and a desire to put People at the heart of what we do. These fundamentals are behind our ambition for 2025, announced in 2012: to be "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food". We have now committed to a B Corp certification approach, which ensures continued improvement of our business model to make a better future through plant-based food."

The Bonduelle Group and Corporate social responsibility

Bonduelle awarded the Global Compact 2019 award for best communications

Global Compact France, a United Nations initiative to encourage and support companies in their social responsibility endeavors, placed Bonduelle's Communication on Progress (COP) in the GC Advanced category.
The jury commended the clarity, informative nature and transparency of the group's Communication. It was

particularly impressed by the use of environmental criteria in investment decisions, the agronomic sourcing charter and information on the deployment of an ethics culture.
As an opportunity for further improvement, the Global Compact recommends that the group prepares a crossreference table with the 10 principles and the 21 criteria of the Global Compact.

Bonduelle runner up in the "European Business Awards for the Environment" (EBAE)
Bonduelle was one of five European finalists for its CSR reporting at the EBAE. This award celebrates companies at the forefront of eco-innovation or that have positioned respect for the environment at the very core of their business principles.

In 2012, Bonduelle launched VegeGo! a visionary and collaborative corporate strategy driving the group's aim to be "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food" by 2025 (details of VegeGo! appear in Chapter 1 of the 2018-2019 universal registration document). Designed to underpin the group's corporate project and global strategy, Bonduelle's CSR approach has been re-defined as five simple, and communicable, macro-objectives to be achieved by 2025, which can be monitored on a quarterly basis by the CSR Steering Committee and annually by the Group Management Committee (GMC).
1. Caring, with our farmer partners, for cultivated land
The aim is for an appropriate combination of alternative cultivation techniques to be used for all land cultivated for Bonduelle, to ensure(1) that progress is made in each of the five agronomy CSR focus areas.
2. Reducing environmental impacts from field to plate
Environmental protection is a major target, to be achieved by measuring natural resource consumption and implementing overall plans to manage greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), biodiversity and water resources across all of the group's operations. Transport flows and related actions to reduce CO2 emissions are also subject to annual assessment. Bonduelle aims for zero loss of natural resources, through saving and recycling. Its aim is to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2035 and for all of its packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025.

3. Encouraging people to eat healthy and sustainable food
The group is committed to healthy, sustainable food by ensuring the traceability of vegetables, and the quality and composition of its recipes. The Company is innovating and increasing access to vegetables through products and services. Since 2004, Bonduelle has been committed to achieving long-lasting improvements in eating habits via the Louis Bonduelle Foundation. Its aim is for all of the group's brands to be developed with a positive impact and to spread the word about the work of the Louis Bonduelle Foundation in the countries in which Bonduelle operates.
4. Ensuring the "well-living" of employees and local communities
The group has a dual objective: on the one hand, to achieve zero workplace accidents for all group employees and, on the other, for all sites to be involved in at least one localcommunity project, to promote employee engagement and embed its sites in their local communities.
5. Encouraging all employees to be part of the CSR strategy
The 5th macro-objective of the Bonduelle Group's CSR approach, "All actors", aims to involve all employees in Bonduelle's transformation into a more responsible business. In 2016-2017, the group launched the #Demain chez Bonduelle ! (The future at Bonduelle) program, open to all employees. The program provides support and training for employees with a sustainable development idea or project. In 2018-2019, Bonduelle continued the targeted

(1) Defined by Bonduelle as: alternative cultivation techniques to conventional agricultural practices, which advance the agro-ecological transition. The alternative cultivation techniques chosen by Bonduelle to produce its vegetables are those which progress at least one of the five CSR focuses of the agronomic strategy.

2.2.2.1 CSR governance ­ GRI 103-3
The Head of CSR sits on the Group Management Committee (GMC)(1), to which it presents the CSR strategy each year for validation, on the proposal of the CSR Steering Committee.
The composition and operation of the Bonduelle CSR Steering Committee meet the needs of the Company. In 2018-2019, it concentrated on six priority themes directly connected to the group's five CSR objectives: packaging, climate change, accessibility to food and sustainable food, employees, relations with farmer partners and B Corp certification. The CSR Committee concentrated on defining ambitious, measurable targets by 2025 for each pillar. In drafting this roadmap, the Bonduelle Group's ambition is to maximize its medium and long-term positive impact. In 2019-2020, there will be a focus on drawing up detailed action plans and the corresponding monitoring mechanisms.
The composition of the Group Management Committee is presented in Chapter 3 of the 2018-2019 universal registration document.
2.2.2.2 Participation in industry think tanks ­ GRI 102-13, 102-42, 103-2
As a key player in its field, Bonduelle plays an active role within professional bodies so that it can contribute its business and

industrial expertise and assert its interests and those of its counterparts, by providing a link between trade associations and federations and the government bodies of the countries in which the group operates.
The 100 group employees involved in the professional bodies have continued their commitments in both technical and political areas to defend their interests and those of consumers, customers, suppliers and farmer partners. Bonduelle employees also answer industry representatives' questions, with the aim of ensuring that regulations are applied in fields such as sourcing of agricultural raw materials, industrial production and consumer protection.
The Bonduelle Group does not seek the support of external professionals to represent its interests and did not fund any political party in 2018-2019.
In 2018-2019, the Bonduelle Group was a member of around 80 professional bodies worldwide and company representatives held roles as Chairman, Vice Chairman or director, in the following organizations:
-- in France: FIAC (French federation of canned food industries), CTCPA (Technical agro-food center), UNILET (National interprofessional processed vegetables union), ANIA (National association of food industries), ADEPALE (Association of prepared food product companies), ANIFELT (National interprofessional processed fruit and vegetables association), SYNAFAP (Trade union of manufacturers of fresh ready-to-eat prepared products);
-- in Spain: PROMARCA (association combining most large-brand manufacturers of food products, beverages, pharmacies and perfumeries);

In line with its commitments and to ensure that its CSR information is accessible to all of its stakeholders, Bonduelle is making its CSR report, taken from chapter 2 of the universal registration document, available on several web platforms (bonduelle.com, unglobalcompact.org and corporateregister. com) and reports back to stakeholders on its work (see 2.2.1.6 Procedures for dialog with stakeholders) at specific meetings.
The Bonduelle CSR report for the 2017-2018 fiscal year, which took the place of a "Communication on progress" (COP)

required of the group under its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, won an award in the Global Compact Advanced category in June 2019 (see page 24).
Bonduelle's CSR reporting was also nominated for the "European Business Awards for the Environment". Rewarded, initially in 2017 at the Grand Prix du reporting environnemental organized by the French Ministry for the Environmental Transition, the group's CSR report has this time been nominated for the European Commission award.
For internal stakeholders, the annual collection of CSR data at group level is a way of identifying areas for improvement. Reporting of this data can be accessed by all the group's sites. This makes it possible to share data and monitor performance.
Bonduelle also shares its CSR information with various renowned expert bodies. Since 2012, the Bonduelle Group has submitted certain of its CSR reporting indicators for auditing by an independent third party, in this instance, Deloitte. Furthermore, in 2012, Bonduelle also attained application level B+ from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards: Core option (see Section 2.11 ­ Cross-reference table of the Corporate social responsibility report with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards Content Index (GRI 101-3, 102-54). Bonduelle has also been part of the Gaïa index, a sustainable development ranking of French midcaps, since 2009. The Company scored an overall rating of 77% and was ranked in 32nd place out of the 85 companies with revenue in excess of 500 million euros (results published in October 2018). Finally, for its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, Bonduelle achieved GC Advanced level from the UN Global Compact.

Caring, with our farmer partners, for cultivated land

Bonduelle defined the CSR component of its agronomy strategy on the basis of five priorities: -- protect the soil; -- increase biodiversity; -- reduce the carbon footprint; -- optimize water quality and efficiency; -- reduce chemical input residues. An overall target of resources for upstream agricultural activities was agreed for 2025: 100% of cultivated land using an appropriate combination of alternative cultivation techniques to ensure progress in each of the five agronomy CSR strands.

An appropriate combination of alternative cultivation techniques is used for all land cultivated for Bonduelle, to ensure that progress
is made in each of the five agronomy CSR focus areas

Protect biodiversity
Reduce the carbon footprint

Protect the soil

Optimize water quality and efficiency
Reduce chemical input residues

Details of the group's progress in relation to this objective is shown in Section 2.4.2.1 The development and deployment of alternative cultivation techniques.

2.4.1.1 The Bonduelle Group's vegetable sourcing model ­ GRI 203-2
Bonduelle cultivates almost 500 varieties of over 30 different vegetables.
In order to produce high-quality vegetables that are affordable for all, Bonduelle devised a sourcing model that prioritizes producer groupings (76% of the group's total cultivated surface areas). This predominant sourcing model is based on entering into contracts with farmers on an annual basis, making it possible to:
-- ensure plot rotation, vital for preventing soil depletion;
-- produce as leanly as possible, in line with sales forecasts, to minimize waste;
-- plan seed planting and harvesting to optimize the industrial yield and quality.

This model also has a number of benefits for farmers who are members of groupings:
-- independence: generally speaking, Bonduelle does not account for more than 20% of their revenue;
-- prices guaranteed several months in advance and not subject to global raw materials price fluctuations offer safeguards for their businesses;
-- fair pay between farmers, corrected for variations in climate and yield in a given production area, which are inevitable due to the length of time between sowing and harvest to enable linear sourcing by factories and optimal use of their capacity;
-- access to the expertise of Bonduelle's 295 agronomy professionals (BFA business unit included): engineers and technicians (field and cultivation supervisors) who share their expertise and know-how with farmers.
The group completes its procurement policy by adapting to the local situation. Where producers are not organized

into groupings, Bonduelle may enter into contracts with independent producers (12% of surface areas), particularly in countries where operations extend over very large areas (Brazil, United States, Hungary, Poland), or may buy through brokers who act as intermediaries (5% of surface areas). Lastly,

in countries where the level of know-how does not meet its quality requirements, or where continuity of supply risks exist, Bonduelle operates its production sites itself (7% of surface areas), taking the opportunity to increase its agronomic know-how and develop alternative growing techniques.

This approach allows Bonduelle to concentrate on its core business of vegetable preparation whilst at the same time developing its agronomic know-how. The group also works with service providers able to take care of transportation, planting, harvesting and other cultivation activities (videoassisted hoeing, crop protection treatment, etc.). This avoids producers having to invest heavily in special equipment and optimizes operational efficiency.
The Company maintains close relationships with its farmer partners (see 2.2.1.6 Procedure for dialog with stakeholders).

To meet the needs and challenges of our countries and markets, the group's agronomy organization is broken down by business unit, each being responsible for its own agricultural policy within the framework of the group's agronomy strategy, which defines common progress objectives, whilst taking into consideration the specific nature of each business unit. Agronomic policy is shared across Bonduelle's network of 295 agronomy professionals (engineers and technicians, field and cultivation supervisors ­ BFA business unit included) who meet once a year on Journées Techniques Agronomiques (Agronomy Technique Days) and, for the rest of the year, interact via fortnightly videoconferences. In May 2019, this network was expanded to include an agricultural trials manager within the BEAM business unit. This role will make it possible to improve the group's expertise in assessing the impacts of alternative cultivation techniques. An employee

responsible for coordinating agricultural initiatives for the BFA business unit also started work in May 2019.
The sales forecasts determine the scope of their Agronomy Departments for each zone. The Agronomy Departments are the link between Bonduelle and its producer partners, from the time contracts are entered into with farmers until the vegetables are delivered to the plant.
In the field of agriculture, the Bonduelle Prospective & Development division supports the business units not only in the short term with certain specific operational issues but, above all, in the medium and long term, by coordinating an agronomic innovation program.
For several years now, the Agronomy Research and Development Department, in close collaboration with the business units, has identified new technologies, tested them and incorporated them into innovative cultivation practices. These activities are carried out on the basis of partnership agreements with various types of third party organization (start-ups, established technology companies, research institutions, etc.). The best agricultural practices developed are then shared and implemented with all the business units.
2.4.1.3 Bonduelle's agronomic sourcing charter
To guarantee product quality, food safety and sound risk management, the group devised a global agronomic sourcing charter in 1996.
This charter sets the rules with which all partner producers must comply. It is an exclusive contractual commitment covering the process from choosing which variety to cultivate through to harvest to ensure that Bonduelle's specifications are strictly adhered to and covering different areas from selection of plots of land and variety selection to cultivation methods. 92% of Bonduelle's partner producers have a contractual obligation to comply with the agronomic sourcing charter. This agronomic sourcing charter is available to download from the Bonduelle website: https://www.bonduelle.com/en/ sustainable-development/documents.html.
The agronomic sourcing charter is key to the extremely close relationship that Bonduelle has with its farmer partners.
The group is working to design innovative partnerships with producers and wants to involve them in a co-construction process. This project will lead the Bonduelle Group to revisit its agronomic sourcing charter.

2.4.1.4 Certifications
Under a protocol spearheaded by Bonduelle 12 or so years ago, 100% of the vegetables produced for Bonduelle Fresh Europe are Global Gap certified. This protocol combines best agricultural practice guidelines outlining the global requirements that agricultural and horticultural companies must meet in terms of food safety, sustainability and quality.
In addition, 50% of the vegetables produced for Bonduelle Fresh Europe come from farms that are LEAF-certified (Linking Environment and Agriculture for the Future) international certification managed by the British organization of the same name. This benchmark includes 83 critical monitoring issues and 21 recommendations covering areas as diverse as soil management and provision of nutriments to crops, crop protection, combating pollution and waste management, energy efficiency and water management.
The BFE business unit is gradually helping all its lettuce producer partners to obtain this certification with a target of achieving LEAF certification for 100% of lettuce volumes in 2025. As the agronomic CSR strategy is in line with the objectives of the guidelines, the main challenge in achieving this objective lies in product traceability.
2.4.2 Bonduelle's agro-ecological transition with its partners
­ GRI 103-2
Bonduelle is committed to the agro-ecological transition of its supply chain. This approach involves reducing the use of chemical phytosanitary products and minimizing the impact on biodiversity and the environment in order to meet society's expectations and increase resilience to climate change in the 21st century.
In order to do this, the group monitors the land through the crops in the fields and supports its producer partners in a preventative approach, by selecting the plots of land best suited to different types of vegetables, requiring long crop rotations so as to minimize the risk of soil diseases and to avoid depleting resources (nutrients, organic matter), while promoting biodiversity and optimizing yields. Bonduelle is also committed to producing no pesticides residue vegetables (see 2.4.2.1 The development of alternative cultivation techniques), which can only be developed by implementing alternative crop routing. A key example of Bonduelle's involvement is the central role of field supervisors who support farmer partners through their presence on the land at all stages of cultivation: from sowing, to harvesting through crop monitoring.

2.4.2.1 The development of alternative cultivation techniques
Bonduelle has set itself the target of "using an appropriate combination of alternative cultivation techniques for all surface areas cultivated for Bonduelle, to ensure progress

in each of the five agronomy CSR strands". To reach this target, the Bonduelle Group is testing and developing a range of alternative cultivation techniques and is assessing their impacts in relation to the five CSR focuses of the group's agronomic strategy.

-- Soil conservation techniques are calculated by adding together the following surface areas: direct seed planting, strip-till, simplified cultivation techniques (no-till and shallow till) and, for BFE only, occasional and no-till.
-- The penetration rate for sustainable fertilization is calculated for 49% of cultivated surface areas, the indicator not yet covering the scope of the entire group (see 2.9.4.1).
-- The penetration rate of irrigation management is calculated for all irrigated surface areas. For information purposes, these currently account for 59% of the group's total cultivated surface areas (see 2.9.4.1).
Examples of the development and deployment of alternative cultivation techniques are shown below.
In Russia, Bonduelle Group farms (more than 10,000 hectares) offer ideal conditions for implementing innovative growing techniques, particularly those that aim to protect the soil such as strip-till, which is being developed. Adopted in 2014 over 500 hectares, this practice covered 3,290 hectares in 2019 and represented 75% of the area of sweet corn produced by these farms. Strip-till, performed using preparatory equipment for the specific seeding line and tractors guided by GPS, limits soil disturbance and ensures greater protection against erosion by covering the majority of the soil with the residues of the previous crop and/or an intermediate crop (intercropping with plant cover). Strip-till encourages

the development of biodiversity in all its forms (superior organisms and microorganisms), on the surface of the soil and beneath. A drastic reduction in fuel consumption (-50%) was also observed as well as a drop in the use of mineral fertilizer. This practice is in the process of being assessed or in the initial phase of deployment in other production areas. Once its performance has been confirmed in a sufficient number of harvests and in different soil and weather conditions and for other crops, it may be extended to other agricultural areas and types of vegetables.
Intercropping with plant cover has been the subject of studies carried out by Bonduelle (see also the paragraph below on the VEGESOL experimental platform). This practice involves sowing one, or generally several complementary species between two crops (or potentially during cultivation). The plant cover is not harvested but destroyed and its residues are left on the plot to protect the soil and enrich it with organic matter and nutrients. This cover also partly allows the growth of weeds to be controlled and the composition of weed flora (weed species) to be managed. Bonduelle actively encourages the adoption of plant cover. In 2019, large-scale trials were organized in Hungary to raise producers' awareness of plant cover and initiate its adoption in said country, as part of the drive to reduce chemical input residues.
Reducing chemical inputs. Levels of residue in vegetables when they are harvested are analyzed across all business

units, especially at Bonduelle Europe Long Life (BELL) and Bonduelle Fresh Europe (BFE), so as to identify trace products. Biological control reduces the need for insecticides and chemical fungicides (and, potentially, chemical herbicides). Combinations of these products are the basis for alternative crop protection programs currently being rolled out, or under development, in the BELL, BFE and BALL business units. These innovative programs also include other alternative technologies (insect nets, video-assisted precision hoeing machines for mechanical weeding). Weeding robots are also being trialed. Two programs specifically developed by BFE are helping with the reduction of residues from chemical phytosanitary products: the "Neutral" program whose objective is to eliminate the use of agents that are authorized but have potentially large impacts on human health and the environment, and the "Clear" program aimed at enabling the total traceability of residues from phytosanitary products.
In 2019, efforts to reduce the use of phytosanitary products bore fruit with the launch of a new range of ready-to-use no pesticides residue salads: lamb's lettuce, baby spinach and iceberg lettuce and canned sweet corn. From 2020 onwards, other Bonduelle branded products will be added, including fresh-cut ready-to-use lettuce and canned and frozen vegetables and, by 2025, Bonduelle will offer a wide range of residue-free branded products.
Within the context of its efforts to develop alternative natural methods (replacing the use of chemical phytosanitary products) to combat diseases and pests affecting certain vegetables, Bonduelle and the French Institute for Agronomy Research (Institut national de la recherche agronomique, INRA) are conducting a joint project on pea black leg (a soil-borne disease compound). This work is the subject of an ongoing doctoral thesis whose objectives are, firstly, to improve diagnostic tools at plot level and, secondly, to improve the knowledge of the pathogens involved and to identify avenues for developing bio-control tools.
2.4.2.2 Collaboration with pilot farms to experiment with cultivation techniques
The Bonduelle Group has three pilot farms: the "La Woestyne" farm in France, a pilot farm on two sites in Russia and the farm in Murcia in Spain.
The VEGESOL experimental platform, set up on the "La Woestyne" farm (Renescure, France) is the result of a partnership between Bonduelle, Syngenta and the University of Picardie Jules Verne (Amiens, France). It was created in order to compare, in the long rotations that are typical of Northern France and over a period of time, the effects of different soil management systems (bare soil tilling, tilling

with plant cover intercropping, no-till bare soil, no-till with plant cover intercropping) on plants, soil, water and the environment.
This first eight-year phase showed the benefit of plant cover in long rotations and the possibility of maintaining productivity whilst abandoning tilling and significantly reducing nitrogenbased fertilization.
The second phase of this long-term project focused on agroecological drivers of increases in pea crop resilience with regard to soil-borne diseases and abiotic stresses such as periods of extreme heat and drought.
VEGESOL has both a scientific aim and works to transfer technology to farmers, by generating best scientific practices (three doctoral theses and nine scientific publications to date) that demonstrate the soundness of agro-ecology practices, as well as practical lessons enabling their adoption and deployment by farmers.
Bonduelle contributed to the creation of the Innova Terre network in 2016, in the Nord-Picardie area. This group currently comprises 60 or so innovative farmers who want to develop practices aimed at protecting and restoring soils, in order to maintain their biological fertility and productive potential in a sustainable way. Innova Terre network activities focus on three main areas: reduced tilling, maximum soil protection and crop rotation.
The Innova Terre network also aims to facilitate discussions between producers. It enables encouragement, stimulation and support to be provided to innovative producers who, on the basis of promising experimental results, are taking part in the large-scale deployment of agro-ecology practices in typical major rotations (including beetroot and potatoes).
The momentum generated by the innovative producers within the Innova Terre network should eventually produce a significant multiplier effect which will enable the rapid and wide-scale adoption of agro-ecology in vegetable production.
Emblematic of this approach, one of the members of the Innova Terre network, Guillaume Tupigny, has introduced an agro-ecology development platform on his farm, known as "Sols Verts", which is partly financed by public institutions (ADEME and Agence de l'eau). Benefiting from the recruitment of a dedicated technician, experienced in agroecology, it aims to compare the agronomic performance of two systems: conventional agriculture and no-till with plant cover over a six-year rotation (typical of Northern France) including beetroot, potatoes and vegetables.
The pilot farm in Spain (Torre-Pacheco, in Murcia) enables numerous technological innovations to be tested: an insect monitoring network comprising connected traps, anti-insect netting, connected capacitance sensors for precision irrigation, video-assisted precision hoeing, weeding robots and spatial

In Russia, the farms operated by Bonduelle use digital equipment, including the decision-making tool, Cropio, which is used to optimize fertilization and irrigation, and thus reduce the amount of fertilizer and water used. Cropio, combining weather information and satellite data, also makes it possible to monitor crops and yield forecasts.
In North America, Bonduelle's sites use AgPOD (Agricultural Portal for Online Data), an online program developed specifically for Bonduelle and its farmer partners to share

AgTech start-ups, particularly in France, Canada, the United States, Spain and Russia. The partners are chosen according to how relevant their programs are for the agronomic priorities set by Bonduelle. The group is keen to channel its efforts and investments into unique and innovative forms of vegetable production that will provide a significant boost to agro-ecology.
Bonduelle has therefore established partnerships targeting the following areas:

actual agronomy data recorded in the field.

-- automation, at this stage focused on weeding;

In 2018-2019, a tool for managing harvesting machines was prepared in conjunction with partner agricultural and transport companies in the Nord Picardie region and one start-up in Lille. This tool, trialed in 2019 on peas, was rolled out this same year for green beans.
The emergence of AgTech solutions based on using connected objects which generate a significant amount of new data, makes it necessary today to develop a central digital platform enabling the collection and analysis of all data related to agricultural production and to convey relevant information for decision-making. Within the context of its digital transition, the Bonduelle Group is developing an online portal open to partner farmers from the BFE and BELL business units. This tool, which is being trialed by producers will, in particular, enable individual farmers to monitor their contractual and agronomic relationship with the group and will provide information on crop management (operations, inputs) by individual farmer, based on the current NorthAmerican AgPOD model.
Certain production areas use predictive disease progression models to optimize fungal treatment (minimum quantity and maximum efficiency) and/or to assess the risk of crop failure and waste of raw materials (seeds, fertilizer, water, etc.). This is the case for the risk of aphanomyces (main pathogenic fungus responsible for soil-borne pea diseases), for example.

-- efficiency and accuracy of crop monitoring;
-- harvest prediction (quantity and quality);
-- harvest management;
-- weather forecasts;
-- irrigation management.
2.4.2.5 The selection of seed varieties is key to the agronomic strategy and CSR challenges
The Bonduelle Group is committed to ensuring that its products are free from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Consequently, Bonduelle ensures that its partner producers use no genetically modified seed varieties. The Bonduelle Group therefore requires that its seed suppliers take extreme care to avoid any unintended presence of genetically modified organisms.
The Bonduelle Group has developed industry-leading capabilities in the assessment of new vegetable varieties, enabling it to forge close relationships with its strategic seed partners. New varieties are trialed to see how well they adapt to different regions and how they grow under local conditions. Bonduelle trials the new varieties under the soil and climate

conditions of each target area. A variety is finally selected once its technological performance has been tested in-plant.
The choice of vegetable varieties is also of crucial importance because it influences many factors that make the agroecology transition possible. In effect, the variety affects the farmer's ability to:
-- maintain crop productivity and quality whilst reducing the use of chemical inputs;
-- improve water and soil nutrient use;
-- protect biodiversity.
Making this varietal choice central to its policy, the group works with its national and international seed suppliers using conventional selection methods to develop varieties that

are most resistant to the diseases, pests and abiotic stresses caused primarily by climate variations (particularly water stress and heat). Bonduelle therefore works with selectors and guides their priorities by establishing objectives in terms of agronomic characteristics and technological and organoleptic qualities. Through its choices, Bonduelle is aiming to promote innovation, enabling productivity to be maintained whilst minimizing the environmental impact. Recently, Bonduelle has wanted to extend its partnerships with seed suppliers to the production of pulses. By encouraging seed suppliers' research and production activities in this area, Bonduelle intends to help its partner farmers to extend the percentage of agricultural land given over to pulses, in response to consumers' demand for no pesticides residue locallyproduced pulses, etc.

Network of natural resources expertise
The network of expertise in natural resources consists of three bodies: the energy and water network, the environment network and the packaging network. These work on implementing Bonduelle's environmental policy and promoting best practice in each area. They share tools, resources, results and key topics: benchmark technologies, optimized investments, harmonized practices, projects and improvement plans, monitoring common indicators, etc.
The CSR Capex Award recognizes and showcases innovative projects that have a positive impact
In order to promote innovative projects for the group's CSR strategy and objectives, Bonduelle has devised the internal CSR Capex Award. In 2018, the winners were the photovoltaics project at the Santarèm site (Portugal) and the scheme for recycling water in agricultural irrigation in Bordères (France). The winners are chosen on the basis of three criteria:
1. Current return on investment (ROI);
2. Future ROI, based on estimates of future energy costs; and
3. The "non-economic value" of the project, i.e. its positive impacts on society, the environment and the Company's reputation. The non-economic value also includes the exemplary nature of the project for other Bonduelle sites.

2.5.2 Target: 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ­ GRI 103-2
Bonduelle has set itself a new target: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2035 (base 2018-2019) on scopes 1, 2 and 3. The details are still being decided and will be set out in an action plan in 2019-2020.
2.5.2.1 The Bonduelle Group's greenhouse gas emissions assessment: a key baseline
Since 2003, Bonduelle has been developing in-house expertise in assessing the carbon footprint of its business and products. In 2016-2017, the regulatory requirement for French companies to disclose significant items of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions generated by their business activities (Article 173-IV of the French Law on the Energy Transition for Green Growth of August 17, 2015, defined by the Decree of August 21, 2016 and amending Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code) gave Bonduelle the opportunity to develop a comprehensive metering system and to organize annual reporting on its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the support of external consultants. The greenhouse gas emissions assessment is based on the GHG Protocol. The majority of the emission factors are based on the ADEME carbon database.
Overall emissions in 2018-2019 came to around 2,000,000 tCO2e. The largest sources of emissions are covered by scope 3, i.e. consumers (35%) and packaging (14%).

2.5.2.2 Bonduelle's actions to facilitate an energy transition for green growth

Alternative energy: Santarèm (Portugal) introduces photovoltaics
Santarèm has installed 3,030 solar panels (5,000 m2) on rooftops and car park shades, generating sufficient energy for 7% to 8% of the plant's needs and reducing its CO2 emissions by 570 tonnes per year. This project will also demonstrate its replicability for developing solar power within the group. The first solar kilowatthours will be generated at the end of 2019.

Bonduelle has a proactive energy transition policy focused on three key areas:

1. Replacing the most polluting energy sources in its energy mix in terms of greenhouse gas emissions: heavy fuel oil

(1) The methodology for measuring emissions from farming, traditionally based on Ademe guidelines, has now been replaced by 2006 IPCC guidelines for Tier 1. This change will help track the impact of changing agricultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions.
Emission factors have been updated to best reflect developments in international reference databases (e.g. packaging materials, electricity by geographical area, etc.). Emission factors related to the processing and use of products placed on the market have been re-evaluated by our third-party expert partner. As a result of the alignment of this year's emission factors with 2017-2018 activity, historical emissions are recalculated as follows: 1,696,215 tCO2e (excluding BFA).

2.5.2.3 Zero energy loss for the industrial activity ­ GRI 103-2, 302-4
Whether electric or thermal, energy is essential for the production process. Electricity is used for the storage of frozen foods, the refrigeration of workshops, the production of compressed air, some machinery (motors and conveyors) and forklifts, the production of chilled water, lighting and air conditioning. Thermal energy is used to generate steam and hot water. It is also used in heat recovery ventilation and power handling equipment.
Bonduelle is targeting "zero energy loss" by rationalizing consumption to minimize energy loss and eliminate waste. The target is for 100% of sites to implement the means and

actions identified using the group's energy performance evaluation grid by 2025.
Supported by the environment and energy network, the action plan mainly consists of auditing on-site consumption, ongoing efforts to obtain ISO 50001 certification for energy management, and the group's involvement in mandatory European energy-saving mechanisms. Other measures are also put in place, such as the roll-out of metering and management tools, the installation of heat recovery systems, optimization of lighting energy consumption (using LED lighting), and the introduction of systems to prevent energy waste (Start and Stop).
The "zero energy loss" approach, applied to electricity, gas and steam consumption, achieved the following results ­ GRI 302-4:

Consumption audit
The year 2018-2019 focused on introducing routine audits of site energy consumption, based on the group's performance evaluation grid. 100% of the sites of the BELL, BALL, BEAM and BFE business units were audited by energy experts. The audit findings will enable each site to identify the energy efficiency means and actions to be put in place. These routine audits will be carried out at BFA sites from next year.

2.5.3.1 Sustainable water management
At Bonduelle, water is used in the plants as an ingredient in the finished product (liquid, sauce) and in the manufacturing process as a way of transporting and transferring heat or cold. It is also used to wash vegetables and to clean production lines. The relative proportion of these uses depends on the industrial activity in question, and differs at each site. On the

Cooling canned products is the most water-intensive stage of the transformation process. In Saint-Césaire, the addition of cooling water recirculation loops reduced consumption by 12%, equivalent to 30 million liters of water.

2.5.3.2 Wastewater treatment and management of treatment plants
The Group's Environment Department rigorously controls and monitors the quality of plant effluent before it is discharged into the natural environment.
In 2018-2019, industrial effluent contained an organic load of 40,752 tonnes of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). This breaks down as follows:
-- 70.9% of this load was treated by Bonduelle in independent aerobic biological treatment plants;
-- 20.9% in agricultural spreading;
-- 4.8% in external treatment plants;
-- 3.4% was discharged into the natural environment in compliance with regulations.

(1) The kWh cumac is the unit of measurement of French energy savings certificates. It corresponds to the cumulative final energy consumption in kWh discounted over the life of the product (kWh of cumulative discounted final energy) and represents the amount of energy saved by the actions implemented.

To address water shortages faced by local farmers during the summer months, the Bordères site recycles 100% of treated water in agricultural irrigation. Previously this water would have been discharged into the river. Replicable internally, this project ­ which creates circularity and is beneficial for river biodiversity ­ won the 2018 Bonduelle CSR Capex Award.

2.5.4 Responsible product and packaging design and the fight against food waste ­ GRI 103-2
Bonduelle uses various types of packaging to ensure the best possible quality and experience for its customers:
-- steel and aluminum for metal cans;
-- glass for jars;
-- flexible plastic for bags of frozen and fresh vegetables;
-- rigid plastic for trays of ready-to-eat prepared products;
-- cardboard for some frozen packaging and all bulk and transport packaging.
These materials are chosen according to processes, preservation requirements, market convention and their robustness in relation to the product and their use.

Minimizing the quantities of materials used in packaging
Taking into account the technological developments introduced by its suppliers, Bonduelle performs an annual audit of all its packaging to optimize the quantities of materials used. This has been carried out at group level and

economically without compromising on performance, while taking into account the specific constraints of the various industrial procedures and tools. This approach, already in place for metal, is set to be rolled out to other materials.
-- Used for canned products, metal (steel, aluminum) is Bonduelle's primary packaging material. Between 20162017 and 2018-2019, the group achieved its target of saving 1,500 tonnes of metal over three years at constant scope.

At present, it envisages replacing all non-recyclable multilayer film, particularly in its frozen range.
Lastly, Bonduelle is monitoring how the packaging it places on the market is actually recycled. This involves ensuring that recycling channels exist in countries prior to introducing products with a new packaging material. In 2018-2019, more than 78% of cans and more than 74% of glass jars were recycled in Europe (Source: Eurostat, Europe 2016 data).

-- Since the acquisition of Ready Pac Food, whose fresh readyto-eat products are packed in plastic packaging, Bonduelle has stepped up its efforts to optimize the quantities of plastic used. The group has already begun mapping its plastic packaging.

Plastic packaging: reduction of packaging and increase in recycled plastic content

-- This will be extended to include cardboard and glass from next year.
Choosing recycled and environmentally-friendly
materials ­ GRI 301-2
Bonduelle has decided to significantly increase the proportion of recycled material in its packaging wherever possible. In 2018-2019, this reached 50.2% in Europe. This year, for example, the packaging of ready-to-eat prepared vegetables

The BFE and BFA business units have expedited the eco-design of polyethylene (PET) packaging in their ready-to-eat prepared vegetables lines by increasing the rPet (recycled PET) content and dispensing with non-essential lids.
At BFE, for example, the percentage of rPet in some packaging has increased from 12% to 50%. Non-essential plastic lids have been scrapped. This has saved 32 tonnes of plastic in one year.

(1) A packaging or a packaging component is recyclable if post-consumer collection, sorting, and recycling is proven to work in practice and at scale. A package can be considered recyclable if its main packaging components, together representing more than 95% of the entire packaging weight, are recyclable according to the above definition, and if the remaining components do not hinder the recyclability of the main components Source: http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Polymer-Choice-and-Recyclability-Guidance.pdf

2.5.4.3 Fight against food waste
In addition to its internal "zero-loss" policy in plants (see Section 2.5.5 Waste management: zero loss and circular economy), Bonduelle is committed to the fight against food waste.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 30% of global food production is thrown away without being consumed. Instead of destroying products that do not meet Bonduelle's specifications in full, but are perfectly edible, the group donates several tonnes of vegetables each year to charities, which redistribute them locally. The amount totaled 3,986 tonnes in 2018-2019, covering Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Poland and Hungary, for canned, frozen, fresh-cut ready-to-use salad and ready-to-eat prepared vegetables.
Food waste: 250 tonnes of goods per year donated to food banks in Russia
Several Russian sites (Novotitarovskaya, Timashevsk, Moscow) have set up schemes to donate end-of-life and damaged products to food banks, provided the products are safe and labeled for consumer use.
Bonduelle also endeavors to raise awareness of food waste among consumers. The group offers different kinds of packaging (shelf life, portion size) and specifies the size of the portion so that consumers can make appropriate choices depending on their type of household and consumption. In addition, Bonduelle's websites and social networks provide practical information such as help understanding use-by dates.
2.5.5 Waste management: zero loss and circular economy ­
GRI 103-2
To help achieve the environmental target of "zero loss" by 2025, Bonduelle optimizes resources throughout the product life cycle, starting with responsible product and packaging design (see Section 2.5.4), and promotes the circular economy.

2.5.5.1 Reduction at source of vegetable waste
In 2018-2019, 593,883 gross tonnes of vegetable waste were generated at Bonduelle's sites. This corresponds to 485 kg of vegetable waste per tonne of manufactured product (TMP). This ratio represents a 3.4% improvement on the previous year, as a result of the different types of vegetables processed. During this fiscal year, 90.7% of vegetable waste was recycled commercially, used as animal feed, converted into methane or used as compost.
2.5.5.2 Industrial waste management
Thanks to the efforts of all its plants, the group's overall performance in terms of energy recovery or recycling was 70% in 2018-2019, compared with 90.6% in 2017-2018. This difference is due to the change in scope. At constant scope (excluding BFA), the group's performance would have been 89%. Hazardous industrial waste represented 276 tonnes in 20182019, i.e. a ratio of 0.23 kg per tonne of manufactured product.
Waste: the Rosporden plant (France) gives used pallets a second life
In Rosporden, used pallets are no longer treated as waste. Repaired, resold or used to generate heating, a new use has been found for more than 8,000 pallets.
2.5.6 Territorial management to develop a long-term vision
For Bonduelle, the territorial management angle in the "zero loss" macro-objective complements its operational environmental policy. It offers a different framework for steering four local environmental challenges ­ all of which are interdependent and require a long-term approach ­ around its sites: -- protection of biodiversity and the adequacy of ecosystem
services rendered; -- quality of available water resources; -- absence of disturbance and acceptance by local residents; -- adaptation to climate change and the energy transition.

408-1, 409-1, 412-3, 407-1

For Bonduelle, implementing a responsible purchasing policy involves adopting recognized purchasing model guidelines inspired by nature's cycles and creating shared value for the Bonduelle ecosystem.
With this new perspective, the group is continuing to develop its responsible purchasing and supplier awareness policy, while continuing to focus on food safety and quality, as well as factoring in environmental and social criteria. This policy is being implemented gradually.
2.5.8.1 Engaging fruit and vegetable suppliers and manufacturers of finished products ­ GRI 308-1
Bonduelle sources the majority of its fruit and vegetables from its farmer partners (see Section 2.4 Caring, with our farmer partners, for cultivated land). Independent and cooperative producers account for 88% of the land under cultivation. As early as 1996, the group established an agronomy sourcing charter to guarantee product quality, compliance with the cultivation requirements of each vegetable type, food safety and effective risk management. Fully 92% of the group's producers have signed up to the charter.
Although the group's policy is to source supplies as close as possible to the end consumer, some types of produce may have to be grown in countries further afield, particularly in Africa. Where this is the case, Bonduelle chooses reputable, quality-certified partners who work with small producers on a long-term basis. This guarantees an additional revenue stream for producers, many of whom grow subsistence crops.

2.5.8.2 Engaging, evaluating and supporting suppliers in other categories (ingredients, packaging, finished products, energy, industrial procurement and service provision, etc.) ­ GRI 407-1
The group has set itself the objective of evaluating its main suppliers (by purchasing volume) and those suppliers that have a significant CSR risk rating. This policy was initially put in place in the BELL, BFE and BEAM business units and will be rolled out to BALL and BFA within three years.
To select and evaluate suppliers at risk (on a scale of 1 to 6), Bonduelle has produced a map based on the criteria set out in the vigilance plan (see Section 2.8.2.2 Mapping of vigilance risks). ­ GRI 308-1.
Bonduelle also works with the EcoVadis platform to evaluate high-risk suppliers (levels 5 or 6) and/or suppliers with significant purchasing volumes via an online CSR questionnaire and expert analysis. Using this recognized collaborative platform ensures consistency and transparency in monitoring suppliers' environmental and social commitment. This evaluation also identifies opportunities for innovation and partnerships.
The EcoVadis methodology is based on international CSR standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nations Global Compact, and ISO 26000. The

evaluation is performed using 21 key CSR indicators covering four different areas:
-- environment: energy consumption, water, biodiversity, pollution, materials and waste, emissions, greenhouse gases, product use and end of life, consumer health and safety;
-- social: health and safety, working conditions, labor relations, career management, forced and child labor, freedom of association, non-discrimination, fundamental human rights;
-- ethics: anti-corruption, anti-competitive practices, fair trade;
-- purchasing: environment, working conditions and human rights.
Lastly, suppliers are also asked about any environmental and social disputes in which they have been involved and which received media coverage.
Supplier CSR evaluation results ­ GRI 308-1
In 2017-2018, Bonduelle introduced EcoVadis evaluations for its key suppliers by purchasing volume and risk level. At the end of 2018-2019, 137 suppliers had been evaluated by EcoVadis, representing 43% of the group's purchasing expenditure.
Having analyzed its EcoVadis assessments, and in order to help its suppliers make progress on CSR issues, Bonduelle requests an action plan from suppliers who do not fulfill certain criteria. These suppliers will be reassessed in order to ensure that they are improving.
2.5.8.3 Animal welfare
A minority of Bonduelle's products contain meat and eggs. The group ensures that ingredients of animal origin are sourced from higher-welfare farms. This policy is applied in product development and communicated to Bonduelle's suppliers.

-- Cruelty-free products
The Bonduelle Group does not carry out or endorse animal testing.
-- Free-range poultry without animal meal or growth hormones (Europe)
In Europe, ready-to-eat prepared salads contain free-range poultry reared in environmentally-friendly conditions. Animal meal in poultry feed is prohibited and no growth hormones are used.
In France, for example, the chicken used in fresh products is 100% French in origin and is certified according to the Volaille française standard. In addition to provenance, farmers are committed to continually improving the living conditions of their livestock (thermal comfort, air quality, freedom of movement, natural light, etc.). The health of the animals is ensured using alternatives to antibiotics. The animals are fed on a high-quality diet.
-- Towards a "cage-free" egg guarantee (Europe)
Eggs and egg products account for a tiny percentage of the ingredients purchased in Europe. Bonduelle is committed to gradually increasing its purchases of eggs produced under alternative conditions, so that by 2025, all eggs and egg products contained in its products can be certified as "cage-free".
-- Animal welfare clauses (United States and Canada)
In the United States and Canada, Bonduelle stipulates in its supplier agreements and Code of Conduct that the group is committed to the respectful treatment of animals and expects its suppliers to adopt animal welfare practices. This clause includes the provision of an environment free from distress, cruelty, abuse and neglect.
Mindful of the expectations of its stakeholders, Bonduelle is open and transparent on the animal welfare practices of its suppliers. Through ongoing dialog with consumers online and with the input of various NGOs, including L214 and PETA, Bonduelle can identify expectations and respond to the need for reassurance.

take appropriate measures to control them. As part of this continued vigilance plan, 43,502 food safety tests were carried out on canned goods, and 22,142 tests on frozen, fresh, or ready-to-eat prepared vegetables in 2018-2019.
The policy implemented by Bonduelle to provide maximum product quality is based on a process and management system under the control of a Quality Director in each business unit. Working in a network, Quality Control Departments report to a general coordinator and meet once a year.

To give more support to its plan for healthy and sustainable food, Bonduelle is promoting its commitment and encouraging unity in two innovative areas:
1. Food for Good: Bonduelle is keen to promote plantbased food as being tasty and enjoyable, forging links with today's consumers as well as those of tomorrow, who are increasingly connected and well-informed about environmental challenges, and building consumer confidence when it comes to the quality, traceability, and naturalness of its products.

Each business unit has a quality plan tailored to its specific technological needs (canned, frozen or fresh food, etc.) as well as the (regulatory) context specific to the different Quality plans are implemented in all of the group's production facilities, based on three main aspects:
1. Quality checks on incoming raw "plant" materials and all other supplies;

(1) It is well known that, together with fish, vegetables are the least favorite food category among children. It is also widely accepted that a low intake of fruit and vegetables is a factor in early mortality (Binh Nguyen et al., Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2016; 13: 9). Having an understanding of food comes from learning about it at an early age. Studies show that the sooner children are exposed to a wide variety of foods; the more likely they are to enjoy a variety of foods in adulthood. Studies also show that it is possible to boost the enjoyment and consumption of vegetables through a process of familiarization, for example by presenting new vegetables in multiple ways, developing an understanding of the plant, and taking part in cookery workshops (Sensitive periods and factors in the early formation of food preferences, S. Issanchou, S. Nicklaus, ebook.ecog-obesity.eu).

phytosanitary residues and trace metal elements were carried out by an independent laboratory, and 100% had a compliant result.
The results of these control plans lead to continuous improvement actions. In particular, the quality plans of production facilities are accompanied by a policy of investing in and upgrading industrial facilities, certification processes and analysis of the risks of fraud and malfeasance.

Bonduelle has a certification policy for its production sites, developed in line with industry standards, and specifically taking into account its locations, or client requests. This policy was initially based on ISO 9001. Quality management systems have now reached maturity, so Bonduelle is gradually discontinuing ISO 9001 certification renewal and refocusing its certification policy on other benchmarks, including Global Food Safety Initiative-recognized standards such as IFS and BRC.

The majority of our quality-certified agro-industrial production facilities are certified by several bodies:

100% of Bonduelle production sites have at least one type of quality certification;

23 IFS and/or BRC sites

IFS: Private international food standard, owned by the French Food Retail and Wholesale Federation (Fédération des entreprises du commerce et de la distribution, FCD) and its German counterpart. The IFS evaluates food product suppliers focusing on product quality and safety. The current version is IFS V6. BRC: British Retail Consortium: a private standard owned by the British Retail Consortium and very similar to the IFS. The current version is BRC V6.

5 FSSC 22000 certified facilities 8 American SQF certified facilities

SQF: Safety Quality Food ­ Private international standard owned by the Foundation for Food Safety Certification, based on ISO 22000 and PAS 220 for food producers.

3 ISO 22000 certified facilities.

This standard specifies the requirements for food safety management systems and aims to improve customer satisfaction by effectively controlling food safety hazards.

2 ISO 9001 certified facilities.

International quality management certification standard delivered by an accredited external body. It sets out the requirements for an effective quality management system ensuring that products comply with the requirements of customers and applicable regulations. The most recent version is ISO 9001 V 2008.

21 organic farming facilities

According to current laws and regulations, production facilities are certified for the production of organic products.

Natural manufacturing processes
Bonduelle has designed its manufacturing processes so that when plant-based food reach the consumer's plate, they are as close as possible to the food they would eat in the field. To preserve their nutritional and taste qualities, only a few hours elapse between harvesting vegetables and processing them in the plant. Next, the process of transforming raw materials preserves their natural characteristics as much as possible:
-- natural sorting, washing, and peeling: the vegetables are sorted, washed, and peeled mechanically or using steam. For frozen and canned foods, the vegetables are then water- or steam-blanched to preserve their qualities: taste, color, and texture;
-- preserving vegetables using temperature: frozen vegetables are preserved by cold at -30°C, then stored at -18°C; bagged salads and salads in trays are prepared and stored at +1 to +4°C; canned vegetables are preserved solely by heating for just a few minutes at above 130°C in sealed packaging, then stored at room temperature.

Bonduelle ensures its products are quality-controlled and traceable. These practices enable a quick response whenever a quality issue is detected.
-- Dozens of quality control inspections are carried out from harvest to storage of the products, including on temperature, bacteriology and weight.
-- From harvest to storage, all information can be found using the code on the packaging: field and growing conditions, harvest date, preparation conditions in the plant, and storage conditions.
In each country where Bonduelle operates, there is a department dedicated to consumer satisfaction. Each product bears the contact details customers can use to contact the Customer Services Department at any time, either to ask questions or to make a complaint.

First range with no pesticides residue
In order to meet consumer expectations in terms of the quality of food products, Bonduelle launched in early 2019 a range with no pesticides residue(1):

2.6.2.2 Nutritional quality ­ GRI 417-1, 416-1, 103-2

1. Classification of products into three "nutrition" groups,

In committing to achieving results rather than just the means, Bonduelle has opted for a rigorous process with an impact across its value chain and confirmed by systematic tests. This commitment requires joined-up working with its farmer partners and controls throughout the manufacturing process to guarantee quality and traceability. It is based on several

and factual conclusions and use of active chemical substances is limited to that which is strictly necessary;

· Over the past 10 years, Bonduelle has gradually reduced
the salt in its recipes.

-- tests by an independent accredited laboratory on 100% of the plots for the range with no pesticides residue: products must show a concentration of pesticides residue beneath the limits quantifiable by the testing methods (0.01 mg/kg). In total, tests are carried out for all molecules liable to be found in residues, a total of 300 for ready-to-use salads and over 500 for canned sweetcorn;
-- the adaptation of plant processes.

· Bonduelle only adds sugar to recipes that traditionally
use it (steamed peas and carrots) to sweeten the natural bitterness of the vegetable (endive, Brussels sprouts) or the acidity of an ingredient (vinegar, etc.).
1,158 products from all segments were tested from January 2008 to December 2015 to determine if they were in line with the recommended nutritional values.
3. Recipe compliance: between 2009 and 2017, 258 recipes

that did not meet the nutritional criteria were revised by

the business units.

4. All new plant-based products must meet a number of minimum criteria defined by Visa Santé and be positioned in one of the three "nutrition" groups.

The program's objectives also include the development of well-thought out, simple, transparent and objective nutritional information. The group makes no nutritional claims on the packaging of its "prepared and gourmet products".

"Visa Santé" was launched by Executive Management and, in addition to the Nutrition Department, now involves engineers in the Quality, Innovation and Development and Marketing Departments of the various business units.

100% of Bonduelle branded products are evaluated by Visa Santé. (GRI 416-1)

Product innovations: more vegetables, pulses and organic products
In Canada, individual fresh salads were launched thanks to the pooling of production and innovation capacities of the BFA business unit, and the network and Canadian customer knowledge of the BALL business unit team. Moreover, the "Heat & Eat" range offers ready-to-heat meal bowls with fresh vegetables, meats and grains.
Bonduelle has launched a number of pulse-based innovations in the form of meal-sized portions in the Netherlands and organic pulse sachets in Sweden. In France, Bonduelle Food Service has launched the collection B'Creative: les pépites! This range offers a unique 100% plant-based blend of vegetables and pulses. It is currently being rolled out in Poland, Italy, Germany and Spain.
In the organic segment, Bonduelle has created a 100% French organic canned and frozen vegetable range. The frozen range's plant-based packaging contains 45% biosourced material made from sugar cane. In Italy, Bonduelle has brought to market a new range of frozen products, Be!Bio.
Consumer information and satisfaction
On the Bonduelle.com website, the group explains the process of growing and processing plant-based food, from harvest to shipping.
In France, and, since 2018-2019, in Belgium and Spain, Bonduelle has added Nutri-Score nutrition labels to its products (GRI 416-1):
-- fresh and ready-to-eat prepared vegetables: 100% of Bonduelle products have an A score;
-- canned and frozen: 96% of Bonduelle products have an A or B score;
-- specialty: 99% of Bonduelle products have an A or B score.
Designed by the French national public health agency (Santé Publique France), this optional logo provides consumers with the product's full nutritional quality at a glance.

Prizes and awards
Bonduelle was awarded the Innovation Grande Entreprise prize for its InFlavor process at the 28th Innovation Awards by the Association pour le développement de la recherche et de l'innovation du Québec (ADRIQ). This process of controlled dehydration reduces the water content of vegetables prior to freezing in order to preserve their organoleptic properties.
Bonduelle Food Service was awarded an Innovation Award at SIRHA 2019 (world hospitality and food service event) for its Red lentil and carrot nuggets range, a fiber and protein rich plant-based blend.
The BFA business unit was named "Refrigerated Foods Processor of the Year, 2019" for the quality of its refrigerated foods by the magazine Refrigerated & Frozen Foods.
2.6.3 Plant-based food for as many people as possible
Food is a public health issue: according to the World Health Organization (WHO), a diet low in fruit and vegetable is one of the top 10 risk factors for mortality worldwide. Because children are tomorrow's consumers, and because, along with fish, vegetables are the food category they reject most, Bonduelle has come up with a whole world of plant- based food that kids crave. Based on the conviction that eating well is something that is learned, Bonduelle is taking steps to familiarize children with a wide variety of vegetables to encourage them to choose vegetables.
As part of the fight against waste (2.5.5 Waste management: zero loss and circular economy) and Bonduelle employees' involvement in local life (2.7.6.1 Participation in the life of local communities and mobilization of employees), Bonduelle is carrying out numerous solidarity actions to raise awareness about balanced nutrition and donations of vegetables.
In addition, Bonduelle is investing in research to understand children's relationship to food, particularly vegetables, and is supporting actions on the ground through the Louis Bonduelle Foundation.

Since 2017, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation in Russia has been supporting the awareness-raising program, "Nutrition ABC" which aims to teach children the basics of balanced food choices.
In 2018, the program entered a new phase in its development: in partnership with Danone, ANCO "National Open School" (Rybakov Foundation) and experts in education, nutrition and pedagogy, Bonduelle launched an e-course on healthy eating with five lessons aimed at 7 to 10 year-olds. Its main objectives: offering children and teachers educational resources and involving parents in the process through activities. Children learned to recognize and eat healthy food, visited local farmers, grew vegetables, etc. The course was rolled out to 60 schools in six regions in Russia.
Bonduelle is continuing its hands-on work with individuals and professionals
In order to promote the extraordinary creativity of vegetables, Bonduelle has launched the first webzine dedicated to vegetable-growing: Légumiz. Published on Facebook and Instagram in France and in Germany, it is to be rolled out to all European countries where the Bonduelle brand is present.
Bonduelle has become involved with the huge citizens' consultation on better eating habits, Mieux Manger (Eat Better), launched by the platform Make.org. Thousands of citizens have answered the question, "What can be done to improve everyone's eating habits?" offering their solutions and voting for those they want to see implemented at national level. Bonduelle has encouraged all of its employees to take part and suggest ideas.
Finally, Bonduelle has created Greenologie, a comprehensive service to help professionals in the food sector, whether independent businesses, chains or catering, put plantbased foods at the heart of their menus. This online turnkey solution presents: the basics of plant-based foods, video tutorials, veggie trends and easy-to-follow gourmet recipes. Those professionals who wish can follow up with a face-toface meeting by making a personalized appointment with Bonduelle's culinary advisers.

2.6.3.2 Research on food and eating habits
Building on the success of the first strand delivered last year in France in partnership with Epicurium, a museum dedicated to the discovery of fruit and vegetables, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation has rolled its EPICALIM research program out in Canada. In 2018-2019, the research project conducted with the ITHQ (Institut de tourisme et d'hôtellerie du Québec) studied the impact actions on the ground have on the capacity of children to change their eating habits in relation to a number of foods. The results were shared in a scientific paper displayed and circulated as part of the Journées Francophones de Nutrition (Francophone Nutrition Days). This educational resource illustrates how taking part in a cooking workshop influences a child's ability to cook in the short and medium term.
The Louis Bonduelle Foundation has published a monograph(1), available for download on its website, to support early years professionals and non-profit organizations in improving the impact of actions aimed at increasing children's appreciation, knowledge and consumption of vegetables. This literature review is based on 17 international scientific studies. It offers ideas for actions and tips on optimizing outcomes as well as identifying criteria for success and improving children's eating habits. The main conclusion of this guide is the following: the most effective long-term actions are those that combine a number of practices, that are both sensory (gardening, cooking, tasting) and cognitive (nutritional education, games, reading, etc.).

Finally, the Louis Bonduelle Research Award is aimed at researchers under the age of 35 enrolled with a university or higher education institution. Every year, it rewards food research, irrespective of the discipline: medicine, physiology, sociology, agronomy, etc. There have been 16 winners since 2006.
In 2019, the Bonduelle Group funded the first joint award for a thesis, "The bioeconomy and 3rd industrial revolution", organized by Mission Rev3. This collective initiative, led by the CCI (Chamber of Commerce and Industry) and the Hautsde-France Regional Council, aims to boost the third industrial revolution in the region.
The challenge put to students: increase consumption of plant-based proteins
In partnership with Village by CA Nord de France, Bonduelle joined the student challenge "increase consumption of plant-based proteins on our plates". The challenge? Innovate to feed nine billion human beings in 2050 whilst keeping the impact of the production of food proteins on the climate and biodiversity under control. Almost 300 students considered this challenge. The challenge was won by four students who devised a high-protein plant-based snack that boosts strength and well-being among dependent elderly people.

objectives), the Bonduelle Group has made it its ambition to ensure the "well-living" of employees and local communities.

The group CHRO participates in and contributes to all of the group's strategic decisions:

At Bonduelle, "well-living" is defined as follows: "A state of mind that seeks to balance employees' skills, needs and expectations with the constraints and opportunities linked to the work environment." It is therefore about ensuring that employees are able to flourish, and contributing to the "well-living" of the communities around its sites. These

Discussions take place between the group and Human Resources Directors of each business unit to monitor the progress and implementation of the strategies. Each process

is designed jointly with the business units before it is launched.

2.7.2 Human resources policies and means implemented ­
GRI 103-2
Employee development covers safety, working conditions, social dialog and skills development. These four concerns are central to the Bonduelle Group's human resources policy, which is based on the Company's values. The policy revolves around three strategic priorities:
-- the creation of economic value, through hiring highpotential employees, knowledge and skills transfer and the management of value-creation with quantified targets;
-- the international growth model, integrating skills development, increasing the internationalization of management and anticipating needs;
-- the development of human capital, including talent development, cohesion and a shared corporate culture, and embracing Bonduelle's corporate goals. Through innovation in all its forms (managerial, product, etc.).

The Human Resources teams from the five business units and the group meet at an international seminar held every two years. Bonduelle's overall human resources strategy is presented to a wider audience at these seminars, with a discussion of the future challenges and sharing of best practices. The human resources function seeks to act as a genuine Business Partner.
2.7.2.2 Staff profile and employment policy
Bonduelle Group's staff profile
The Bonduelle Group has a workforce of 10,655 (present at June 30, 2019) and 14,589 full-time equivalent employees (permanent, non-permanent, seasonal and others).
Average years of service among permanent employees is 10. In 2018-2019, BFA business unit data were consolidated.

Employment policy, local employment, seasonal employment
The stability of the number of permanent employees reflects the group's consistent approach to organizing its operations.
The very nature of its business and the rhythm dictated by the harvests mean that the Bonduelle Group employs a large number of seasonal workers. Seasonal employment accounts for 12% of all Bonduelle Group's contracts (full-time equivalents). The Bonduelle Group is committed to all of its workers, and as such is developing responsible initiatives to provide them all with a good working environment (see 2.7.3.1 Safety and working conditions).
The Bonduelle Group utilizes a range of strategies to secure the loyalty of its seasonal employees. In the United States, the group provides specific English language training sessions (via video) to seasonal workers whose first language is not English. In Italy, special programs are also in place for temporary workers without a good grasp of the local language. Loyalty is also earned by compensation policies (competitive overtime pay, bonuses paid at the start and end of the season in Hungary, etc.) and employment contracts which make

must not come at the expense of safety.

Depending on the employment areas in which its sites are located, Bonduelle focuses on local recruitment or opportunities for people from areas with few economic prospects.
2.7.2.3 Organization of work
At all of its locations, the Bonduelle Group complies with local regulations on working hours.
In agro-industrial facilities the operational rhythm is dictated by the harvest or selling seasons.
-- For products with a long shelf-life (canned and frozen), facilities operate mainly during harvests. For example, in the BELL business unit in France a 2x8, 3x8, or 4x8 shift pattern may be implemented in season.

In particular, Bonduelle has adopted the STOP method ­ Safety Training Observation Program ­ to achieve its objective of zero accidents. This method, developed by Dupont de Nemours, is based on preventive observation of behaviors. It enables employees to integrate the safest behaviors into their work culture, to optimize safety performance and to reduce and/or eliminate workplace injuries and illnesses. Participants are trained in methods that give them the knowledge and tools to work safely. Employees trained in this approach can then pass their knowledge on to their colleagues and staff, so that everyone can play a role in everyday safety.
No plant employees, even seasonal workers, can take up their position until they have been trained in safety on the site and on their specific job. They are issued with all general and job-specific safety instructions, and can also take additional training modules ­ in ergonomics for instance.

-- In the case of fresh produce (bagged and ready-to-eat prepared salads), facilities operate all year round and experience fluctuations in activity related to sales. In the BFE business unit in France, work is divided among teams (2x8), with seasonal reinforcements to cover a six-day working week.

Safety is also a mandatory point on the agenda for the Executive Committee, weekly plant Management Committee meetings, monthly meetings between the Industrial Directors of each business unit and Plant Directors, and quarterly meetings between the General Management of business units and Country Managers. Representatives from the business units also attend meetings of a Group Health and Safety Steering Committee.

2.7.3 The basics
2.7.3.1 Safety and working conditions ­ GRI 103-2, 403-4, 403-2
The nature of risks and accidents at work is described in Section 4.2 Risk factors.
Work safety is a priority, which is why Bonduelle has a target of zero accidents with lost time by 2025.
Each and every person working for or with the group has the right to a healthy and safe working environment, ensuring

To mobilize employees on this issue, business units have the choice of factoring safety into the variable compensation granted to operational staff, in accordance with a recommendation issued by the group. This recommendation is changing in line with the new, more stringent standards: the bonus calculation is at least 10% based on safety, with a recommended level of 20%. The criteria for awarding the bonus vary depending on each site. Originally based on performance indicators such as frequency rate, they will gradually move towards more proactive prevention indicators such as the number of STOP observations per thousand hours worked.

Ensuring the "well-living" of employees and local communities

The existence of a safety Google community with 315 members in 2019 allows discussions to take place on best practices, priority measures and investments. Monthly reporting takes place at the group level. This allows the Executive Management to monitor key indicators such as frequency and severity rate over a rolling 12-month period, as well as the list of sites that have been accident-free for 12 months. The results are presented in the paragraph below.
Production facility mobilization in 2018-2019
Bonduelle is aware that safety is a question of culture and time and is striving to strengthen the basics in order to improve the situation. With this in mind business units and facilities have stepped up measures to promote safety at work.
The B!Safe challenge
Launched group-wide in 2018, the B!Safe challenge has enabled each business unit to feed back and circulate ideas for actions or good practices associated with plant safety. As such, over 100 initiatives have been shared and each business unit was given the opportunity to present a flagship project to the Group Management Committee in January 2019:
-- BFA: "Safety in motion" project for the prevention of sprains, strains and musculoskeletal disorders;
-- BELL: non-slip flooring. A non-slip floor has been created for use during handling. It is fitted by hand to protect against products and prevent falls;
-- BEAM: common rules agreed for lorry drivers on site;
-- BALL: orange zone: The orange zone is a project by the Brockport plant (United States). It comprises a zone with a ban on forklift trucks in the packing department. In this zone, pallets of products are transported by hand-operated trucks rather than electrical trucks with the aim of reducing the risk of collision between People and machines. The reduction in the proportion of employees who were given a review is related to the consolidation of data from the BFA business unit;
-- BFE: promoting autonomy and taking responsibility (see below).
In 2018-2019, the BFA business unit rolled out the B!Safe challenge and focused its efforts on developing the "Safety in motion" project.
The BEAM business unit has rolled out the group's safety policy, specifying the commitments to be upheld both at business unit and team level. These commitments may be subject to change each year in order to reduce short and medium-term risks. BEAM has also put in place systematic information-sharing on safety matters prior to each meeting. The aim of the routine is to makes safety a key priority for all. Following the awareness-raising campaign on road accidents in 2017-2018, BEAM began to monitor road accident rates in January 2019. The Novotitarovskaya plant celebrated five

years without an accident at work in September 2018, the result of a strategy initiated some five years previously. With 110 permanent and 100 seasonal staff (full-time equivalent), a total of 320,000 hours are worked at the Novotitarovskaya plant in Russia over a rolling 12-month period. In 2014: creation of a Safety Committee and circulation of the "Golden Rules" of safety. In 2016, a real culture of safety was introduced: indicators, tools for communicating and sharing situations and good practice. 2017 and 2018, awareness-raising around appropriate behaviors and launch of safety observations. In 2018-2019, various investments were made to improve safety on-site: improving the ventilation of the sweet corn processing chain to reduce risks of exposure to high temperatures, protective equipment for the pedestrian routes in the depot, protective equipment for the area between the presses to improve safety when cleaning the conveyor, securing the maintenance platform for auxiliary equipment at height, securing the palletization zone.
The BFE business unit has opted to ask its employees to suggest the improvements they want to see in their workplace. This increases the autonomy of teams and provides novel solutions for reducing uncomfortable conditions at work: robotization reduces the discomfort of packaging stations in most ready-to-use product plants and ergonomic adaptations have been made at workstations in plants where ready-to-eat prepared vegetables are processed.
The BALL business unit has continued to implement its Dupont STOP prevention program centered on changing the working habits of employees in the industrial setting. This program teaches Managers, supervisors and team leaders how to observe their employees at their workstations and how to interact with them in order to acknowledge safety measures and correct hazardous situations and behaviors. Eight of the 12 plants have been running for over a year without any accidents with lost time. The Oakfield and Ingersol plants celebrated seven and six consecutive years respectively without accidents with lost time. The business unit is also continuing to implement the FAAST project (Focused Accountable Small Safety Team). A project to boost plant safety. Launched in 2015, it brings together employees from different departments to resolve common safety problems, bringing in employees from different locations with wideranging expertise. Good practice is shared with all Plant Directors. The BALL teams in North America have already successfully brought 15 projects to fruition.
The BELL business unit is securing full buy-in by line management and is rolling out its five golden rules:
-- I wear my personal protective equipment (PPE);
-- I pay attention to traffic routes;
-- I hold the handrail on stairs;
-- I tidy and clean my workstation;
-- I make sure I'm safe before taking action.
A multi-site training program was launched in Nord-Picardie (France) in 2018-2019. An initial pilot group took a 12-day training course including one day dedicated to safety. Three new groups are already scheduled to take part in 2019-2020.

Bonduelle complies with international labor laws. It is committed to respecting the European charter of fundamental rights in its organization. The group has also undertaken to comply with and promote the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Convention No. 135 concerning workers' representatives. Most of the countries in which Bonduelle operates as an employer are signatories to these conventions, meaning that 53.4% of employees are covered. Bonduelle's internal commitments ensure compliance with these conventions, over and above countries' commitments. The countries that are not signatories are:
-- fundamental convention No. 29 on forced labor: United States;
-- fundamental convention No. 87 on freedom of association and protection of the right to organize: Brazil, United States;
-- fundamental convention No. 98 on the right to organize and collective bargaining: United States;
-- fundamental convention No. 100 on equal remuneration: United States;
-- fundamental convention No. 111 on discrimination in employment and occupation: United States;
-- fundamental convention No. 138 on minimum age: United States;
-- convention No. 135 on workers' representatives: Belgium, Canada, United States.
All countries in which Bonduelle employs people have ratified the following conventions:
-- fundamental convention No. 105 on the abolition of forced labor;
-- fundamental convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labor.
The Bonduelle Group has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. Launched in 2000, the Global Compact aims to encourage companies to adopt fundamental values according to 10 universal principles derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

2.7.3.3 Wage policy and employee recognition ­ GRI 203-2
In all countries where Bonduelle has a presence, the group's wage policy goes above and beyond the current minimum wage. The group offers wages in line with those in its sector. The rules applicable in each country reflect local realities, in compliance with the principle of fairness.
Following the Climate survey conducted in 2017-2018, the BELL business unit implemented an agreement to improve the career development of workers, employees, technicians and supervisors (OETAM) and make compensation more transparent. This agreement provides for the definition of key roles and structuring job descriptions, mapping of the career paths that provide visibility to employees, the introduction of a classification specific to Bonduelle ensuring fair compensation, the setting of a harmonized compensation policy.
In France, the Bonduelle Group has chosen to grasp the opportunity provided by the "Bill on emergency economic and social measures", adopted by the parliament on December 21, which enabled employers to pay their employees who earn less than three times the minimum wage (SMIC), a premium of up to 1,000 euros, which is exempt from income tax, social security contributions from the employer or employee and social levies (CSG/CRDS). 89% of employees in France were eligible, and Bonduelle paid out a total of almost 1 million euros.
2.7.4 Responsibility
The Bonduelle Group has chosen to work on four focus areas within the Responsibility pillar: employability of its staff, employee health, diversity and transparency.

2.7.4.2 Benefits and healthcare
The Bonduelle Group has set the goal of giving all permanent employees access to a social welfare system by 2025. The audit undertaken in early 2017 continued in all countries in 2018, with a view to deepening the knowledge of market practices and drawing up recommendations for the Bonduelle Group. The next step for the Company is to establish its program on group-wide key benefits by 2025.
2.7.4.3 Diversity ­ GRI 103-2, 405-1
The Bonduelle Group firmly believes that diversity in the workplace is a form of wealth to be explored and shared.
It is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination in the workplace and in employee relations, both direct and indirect. This principle of non-discrimination applies not only to hiring, but also throughout all stages of employment and during the various HR processes (training, assessment, compensation). It is underpinned by programs to promote diversity.

Gender diversity
French agreement on professional equality and quality of life at work of February 12, 2018. This agreement reaffirms the group's commitment to promoting gender equality, with diversity regarded as a key factor in the group's performance and in the personal fulfillment of its employees. The aim is not only to recruit, develop and retain employees with diverse personal characteristics (age, culture, origin, gender, disability, etc.), but more importantly, to capitalize on differences, ensuring that everyone can help achieve the group's goals by reaching their full potential.
In France, "the gender equality index" was launched by the government in November 2018 to look at pay gaps within companies. Bonduelle began to calculate its workplace equality score across France. For the BELL business unit, where most French employees work, the index calculated for the 2017-2018 fiscal year was 84 points out of 100. The group intends to publish its indices for Bonduelle S.A. and the BFE business unit at end-2019, ahead of the legal deadline.
In Canada, the BALL business unit participated, via representation of the Canadian Association of Companies in the Food and Beverages Sector, in the conference held on May 9-10, 2019 by the French Ministry of Employment, Workforce Development and Work. The aim of this conference

was to pool exemplary tools and practices useful to employers in promoting female progress in the labor market and bring about change in the world of work in Canada.
Inter-generational diversity
Two agreements signed in 2018 underscore the Bonduelle Group's commitment to diversity:
French agreement on intergenerational workforce planning of December 1, 2017. This agreement reflects a desire to predict and accommodate the transformation of the business, anticipate the skills that the Company will need in future in a timely manner, manage and plan for the wave of retirements that the group faces because of its age pyramid, recommend actions to promote the sustainable inclusion and retention of young people and "senior" workers, and facilitate the necessary skills renewal by encouraging schemes to transfer employee knowledge and skills, key elements of the Company's wealth.
The BELL business unit in France held a recruitment day for young engineers, during which five teams of two recruited an incubator of 10 young engineers out of the 120 applications received in response to a posting. They will take up their posts at three French plants in early September 2019.
To ensure the transfer of certain technical roles, all plants in the BELL business unit introduced a mentoring program in 2016. Around 50 mentors will share their knowledge of technical roles such as crimper, sterilizer, etc.
Inclusion and retention of employees with disabilities
Through its HANDIPOL disability mission, Bonduelle has had a proactive policy for the inclusion and retention of employees with disabilities in France since 2006.
Jointly managed, the disability mission is responsible for coordinating and harmonizing internal and external actions in the area of disability policy. Since its creation, there have been

four agreements on the inclusion and retention of employees with disabilities. The employment rate for employees with disabilities was 1.8% at the end of June 2019.
Since this agreement expired in December 2017, a fifth agreement was signed on February 12, 2018 for a fouryear period. Through this fifth agreement on inclusion and retention, the Bonduelle Group reaffirms its commitment to:
-- embedding the existing diversity schemes in place for the past few years in the group's culture, with new corporate awareness actions and the involvement of all employees;
-- achieving a 6% employment rate for employees with disabilities across the group;
-- adapting the targets and resources available to each site to improve or maintain their employment rates;
-- addressing any skills gaps to facilitate retention;
-- tackling the issues raised by an aging population at the various group sites.
To achieve these objectives, the Bonduelle Group Executive Management in France has identified five priorities:
-- recruitment;
-- retention;
-- inclusion and training;
-- relationships with the sheltered employment sector;
-- management and coordination.
In France, a disability awareness breakfast was organized with the La Vie Active ESAT for all employees at the head office in Villeneuve d'Ascq (France). The year's successes (employment rate, partnerships, adjustments to workstations) were discussed within the four buildings to raise awareness as much as possible. During the day, activities took place so that 50 employees were able to put themselves in a disability situation.

In accordance with the law, each of the French entities set up a Social and Economic Committee in March 2019, six months ahead of the requirement. These committees replace the works councils, employee representation committees and the health, safety and working conditions committees. Further, the group has provided all these sites with a health and safety at work committee, even at sites with a smaller workforce than the legal threshold for the law's application. Delegation hours have been allocated to each member of the health and safety at work committee.

across almost 20 countries. The inclusion of the BFA teams represents an additional 3,081 employees, giving a total of 11,214 respondents.
The data was analyzed by an external organization, guaranteeing the confidentiality of the responses. The results for each entity were compared internally with those belonging to the same controlling area, and with the results of the previous survey. The group's results were also compared with those of other companies. Managers from each entity were informed of their own results and were assisted in sharing these results within their teams, as well as in devising and implementing improvement plans.

The European Works Council (EWC) is a forum for cross-border information, consultation, exchange of views and social dialog. The EWC provides regular updates on Bonduelle's situation and development, organizes social dialog, and presents the group's social policy, particularly on employment, training, safety and working conditions, and CSR. It meets at least once a year to present the group's strategic direction and report on the fiscal year just ended in Europe.
The French group Works Council is the representative body for Bonduelle's activities in France (canned, frozen and fresh products and ready-to-eat prepared vegetables). This Committee provides French employee representative bodies with additional information, above and beyond its legal obligations, on Bonduelle's activities in Europe and outside of Europe.

Office Vibe: measures real-time team engagement and satisfaction
At BALL, employees were invited to test a fully digital survey tool for more regular and targeted monitoring of Managers with their teams. Office Vibe complements the Climate survey; it is a fun way to quickly measure the real-time commitment and satisfaction of the teams. The pilot phase begun in May 2018 with 80 employees was conclusive and the roll out of the solution for the entire business unit is underway.

Specific actions to learn from the Climate survey
Following the results of the training and personal development category, the BEAM teams implemented two programs.
A communication on career development, with:
-- a Career guide with the key evolution factors for employees to build their own careers;
-- the sharing of real-life success stories based on the actual experiences of employees who have evolved in their roles or even changed job or location;
-- a Careers day which presents the factors that influence a long-term career evolution. A test is also offered to participants to identify their own motivations;
-- discussions with members of management: advice on the books to read, the questions to ask yourself, key stages and things to consider.
A three-facet recognition program:
-- years of service: a gift at each major anniversary: 5, 10, 15, 20 years at the group;
-- innovation: an annual prize for the most innovative employee ideas to develop the group;
-- Likes Awards: a peer-recognition vote which takes place twice a year.
Cessation of business
The Bonduelle Group has no official policy that it systematically applies in this field, since shutdowns have rarely happened in its history. Support measures in the event of departures are taken on a case by case basis taking into account the specific situation of the site concerned, local regulations and the characteristics of the jobseekers.

2.7.5 Fulfillment
Fulfillment is a powerful lever for employee engagement. Actions around employee development, quality of life at work and improvements in working conditions and environments are put in place so that everyone can get a sense of fulfillment from working for Bonduelle.
Sites are encouraged to take ownership of the process by developing their own action plan in response to their specific challenges. Various initiatives have emerged across the group, some of which are described here.
At the Reutlingen and Straelen plants (FRESH and BELL) (Germany): to raise awareness of the impact of stress on health in the workplace on a daily basis, employees were offered initiatives to inspire them to take care of their physical, mental and nutritional health. Set up in conjunction with our Louis Bonduelle Foundation, the project includes physical activity, awareness-raising and mindfulness training workshops.
The BFE business unit offers a site-based "well-being and safety" program which takes various forms with, for example, on-site yoga sessions and visits from physiotherapists/ osteopaths tasked with promoting preventive measures or offering training on how to reduce stress in the workplace.
The BALL business unit has built its employee well-being program "B!Well" on the basis of an analysis of employee health data (report on medicines reimbursed via group insurance, use of the employee aid program, statistics on disability claims, etc.). The Well-Being Committee put together three challenges with the aim of mobilizing and motivating employees to take care of their health: "Eat well", "Take exercise", "Sleep well". Individually, or in groups, employees rose to the challenge of making some related lifestyle changes. The objective being that, after one month, employees would incorporate these healthy-living habits into their daily routines.

2.7.6.2 Promoting the employer brand in a meaningful way
APONH, a flagship project reflecting Bonduelle's commitment to communities
APONH is a development aid project launched in 2012 and currently taking place in Cameroon. The aim is to help local communities live sustainably by supporting farmers and entrepreneurs with the development of their crop-growing industry. APONH also supports the Moineaux school, which provides around 200 children, including disadvantaged children and orphans, with an education. Working alongside its project partner, the European Institute for Cooperation and Development (IECD), APONH is led by a team of employee volunteers from all business segments. Bonduelle's employees take part in a joint project linked to the Company's businesses and know-how. The project has the support of the Bonduelle family, who were keen to join the initiative.

Each year, the group's employees rally behind the project. For example, in 2018-2019:
-- 230 "back to school" kits were funded by donations from Bonduelle employees, enabling children attending the Moineaux school to receive an exercise book, a pencil, a bar of soap and a uniform at the start of the school year;
-- four employees from Canada and France volunteered in Cameroon to support the beneficiaries of the project to expand their activities, offering advice on agricultural and management issues and market research;
-- greetings cards featuring drawings done by children at the Moineaux school were sold in aid of APONH, helping to finance a new fence around the school.
In February 2019, Capital magazine ranked Bonduelle in 3rd place in terms of top employers in the agri-food sector in France. The group has moved up 24 places since 2016.

2.8 Ethics and vigilance

2.8.1 Ethical business practices ­
GRI 102-12, 102-16, 103-2
The Bonduelle Group reviews and improves, on an ongoing basis, the programs and systems that it puts in place to promote ethical business practices both within entities that it controls and within partner organizations. In 2017-2018, the group was particularly keen to improve their clarity and performance as part of the enactment of laws such as Law No. 2016-1991 of December 9, 2016, on transparency, anti-corruption and the modernization of economic life (referred to as the "Sapin II law") and Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017, on the duty of vigilance of parent and instructing companies (referred to as the "Duty of vigilance law"). Bonduelle's ambition to obtain B Corp certification (see 1.1 Interview with Guillaume Debrosse, Chief Executive Officer of the Bonduelle Group) reinforces the role of ethics within the group.
2.8.1.1 The Bonduelle Group commitments
United Nations Global Compact
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003, Bonduelle is committed to respecting and promoting the 10 basic principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment and fighting corruption.
Bonduelle's values
The Bonduelle Group's commitment to ethical business practices also takes the form of a determination to comply with laws and regulations, the definition of strong values, an unequivocal commitment on the part of the Executive Management (see https://www.bonduelle.com/en/group/ values.html) and the provision of tools to assist decisionmaking.
The Bonduelle Group ethics charter
A cornerstone of the Bonduelle Group's ethical policy since 2012, its ethics charter is an internal and external manifestation of its commitments.
Through this charter, Bonduelle is establishing its credentials as a responsible corporate citizen, a people-minded and trustworthy company. In doing so, as part of a process of improvement, Bonduelle intends to defend and promote its values: People-minded, Confidence, Openness, Simplicity, Integrity, Fairness and Excellence. This charter adds to the legal and regulatory framework with which the group must

comply with the aims of the majority family Shareholder and its seven values.
The Bonduelle Group ethics charter presents the ideal that the group would like to achieve to inspire all employees as well as stakeholders with whom they are in contact. The ethics charter should offer the opportunity to challenge practices whilst also providing a decision-making tool.
The full text of the Bonduelle Group ethics charter is available at the group's website www.bonduelle.com(1): https://www. bonduelle.com/en/sustainable-development/ documents.html.
Commitment from Executive Management
In December 2018, the Bonduelle Group's Executive Management broadcast a video message from Guillaume Debrosse to all employees, stressing the group's anticorruption and duty of vigilance commitments. In this message, the Chief Executive Officer reminded viewers of the existence of the ethics charter, the Code of Conduct for ethical business practices and whistleblowing procedures. A dedicated "Bonduelle and ethics" page was created on the B&Co intranet and made available to employees. This page provides access to ethical principles and reminds all employees of their importance for the group. It helps individual employees to understand the role that certain tools can play in introducing ethics into their everyday activities and contains a space for documents containing all the codes, charters and procedures that constitute the corpus of rules and principles to be assimilated and applied, together with related explanations. The page also contains a reminder of the ethics procedures to be followed: monitoring and assessment, audits, continuous improvement. By disseminating these educational tools, Bonduelle aims to support employees to apply ethics on a daily basis.
2.8.1.2 The Bonduelle Group's Ethics Committee
The role of the Ethics Committee is to support the Company on ethical issues, and to issue opinions in an advisory capacity.
It is made up of four members from both inside and outside the business, chosen based on their experience, profile and expertise. The Ethics Committee reserves the right to invite outside experts or submissions from employees on specific subjects. It meets at least twice a year. Its composition is detailed in chapter 3 of the 2018-2019 universal registration document.

2 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Ethics and vigilance

-- training for Managers and staff who are most at risk of corruption and influence peddling;
-- a monitoring and assessment system. Each year a review of the implementation of the anti-corruption program is presented to the Group Management Committee, the Ethics Committee and Supervisory Board by the Legal, Audit and CSR Departments. In terms of subsidiaries, evaluation is through existing reporting tools.
Since the last registration document, 18 Management Committees, including business unit and country Management Committees and the Purchasing Department and seven plant management companies have been trained in ethics, anticorruption and duty of vigilance. This training aims to help these committees to assimilate the group's commitments, Bonduelle's corpus of ethics-related documents and its whistleblowing procedure. It raises management committee members' awareness of Bonduelle's ethics approach, the eight points of the anti-corruption program and the five points of the Duty of vigilance law. They are trained in the rules of confidentiality that apply when dealing with whistleblowing reports.
In accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Conduct for ethical business practices, gifting policies were formalized. In application of the principle of subsidiarity advocated by Bonduelle, each business unit is invited to specify and report, depending on its culture and organization, on the practical aspects of the policy to be applied (threshold, validation rules).
Lastly, a prevention of conflicts of interest questionnaire has been distributed to Managers so that the group can introduce measures to prevent, or resolve, conflicts of interest.
2.8.1.6 Fair competition training program
In 2016-2017 the Bonduelle Group launched an e-learning exercise on the broad principles of competition law, aimed at employees with access to strategic information, in order to build on their knowledge, increase their vigilance and give them sufficient whistleblowing capacity. Over 800 employees in Bonduelle countries took part in this training program which was continued in 2019 and will be attended by new employees. To date, over 90% of the target population has received training.
2.8.2 Vigilance plan
Through its ambition to be "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food", Bonduelle is fully committed to its societal responsibility. First stage agricultural processing is closely associated with the ability to protect soil and

biodiversity, the quality of plant-based production and of the processed products.
Bonduelle fosters a risk-aware culture, including the risks of failing to observe human rights and fundamental freedoms, the risks of serious harm to the health and safety of people and the risk of environmental damage, in accordance with French law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 on the duty of vigilance for parent companies and contracting companies.
This vigilance approach is based on the core values and documents that form the framework of the group's activities: the Shareholder objectives, Values, 10 policies, but also the ethics charter, the Code of Conduct for ethical business practices, membership of the United Nations Global Compact, the CSR policy in five macro-objectives, the agronomy sourcing charter and finally the procedure for evaluating the CSR performance of its suppliers with EcoVadis.
In accordance with the legal requirements, Bonduelle has implemented a vigilance plan. This meets the requirements of the French Duty of vigilance law and involves all employees in a drive for continuous improvement. The vigilance plan formalizes the methods adopted by the Bonduelle Group, as well as setting out reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms on the health and safety of individuals and on the environment. In compliance with Article L. 225102-4 of the French Commercial Code, the presentation of the vigilance plan is followed by the annual report on its implementation.
2.8.2.1 Governance ­ GRI 419-1, 307-1
The vigilance plan was produced and implemented by the CSR Department with the support of the Legal Department and Internal Audit Department. It was developed in association with various group employees, Executive Management and the Ethics Committee.
The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee at Bonduelle SCA ensure that the Company's activities take into consideration the social and environmental issues at stake. These bodies have the task of examining the relevance of the vigilance plan and assessing whether it has been properly implemented. The Ethics Committee, on the other hand, makes recommendations. The Board of Directors of Bonduelle SA is also informed once a year of the vigilance plan and its implementation.
In addition, a Compliance Steering Committee is involved in monitoring the implementation of the vigilance plan and prioritizing the actions to be taken. The Committee is headed by the Deputy CEO Finance & Development, who thus acts as a liaison with the Executive Management, the Chief Executive Board and the Group Management Committee.

2 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Ethics and vigilance

Analysis of risks of the Bonduelle Group's suppliers (see 2.5.8 Responsible purchasing)
Produced in partnership with EcoVadis, this mapping exercise involved five steps:
-- producing a list of 82 purchasing sub-categories from a list of 190 categories supplied by Bonduelle representing all of its purchasing activities. Producing a list of around 13,000 suppliers corresponding to these 82 purchasing sub-categories. The purchasing volume is also recorded for each purchasing sub-category;
-- assessing the CSR risk of each purchasing sub-category using the EcoVadis questionnaire, based on 21 criteria covering four themes: environment, social, ethics, purchasing;
-- incorporating "observed risk": observed risks recorded in the EcoVadis databases;
-- incorporating country risk. In order to evaluate country risk, EcoVadis draws on the following sources: UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank, WHO, FAO, IEA, universities (e.g. Yale), NGOs (e.g. Transparency International);
-- incorporating "sourcing risk", associated with Bonduelle's specific issues, based on three criteria: purchasing volumes, criticality, brand exposure.
The group has set itself the objective of evaluating its main suppliers (by purchasing volume) and those suppliers that have a significant CSR risk rating. This policy was initially put in place in the BELL, BFE and BEAM business units and will be rolled out to BALL and BFA within three years.
Based on this risk analysis, the most at-risk suppliers are identified for an evaluation of their CSR performance (see paragraph "Procedure for evaluating subcontractors and suppliers" below).
Mapping updates
Risk mapping will be updated every two to three years in conjunction with the CSR, Legal and Internal Audit Departments. This update will coincide with the update of the risks identified for the non-financial performance statement and Section 4.2 Risk factors of the universal registration document. In 2019, a review was carried out to ensure that the mapping of vigilance risks was consistent with these new elements.
2.8.2.3 Procedures for evaluating subcontractors, suppliers and subsidiaries
Procedure for evaluating subcontractors and suppliers
In accordance with the Code of Conduct for ethical business practices, and depending on the level of importance and

risk of tier 1 subcontractors and suppliers, the employees concerned evaluate the position of subcontractors, suppliers, intermediaries and service providers with which the group has an established business relationship. They thus ensure that these stakeholders adopt equivalent principles to those of the group's ethics charter and the United Nations Global Compact, and that they take the necessary steps to identify and prevent the risks of violations of human rights, fundamental freedoms and health and safety rights, as well as the risk of environmental damage within their organization.
Relations with farmer partners (upstream agricultural suppliers) come under the framework of the agronomy sourcing charter and contracts that are renewed on an annual basis (see Section 2.4 Caring, with our farmer partners, for cultivated land). This in-depth contractual relationship and partnership, overseen by Bonduelle's agronomy teams, is the process put in place by the group to evaluate this strategic category of suppliers. It is also the tool used to implement the appropriate measures to mitigate risk and prevent serious harm.
With respect to other suppliers and subcontractors, since 20162017, Bonduelle has begun to roll out a plan for the evaluation by EcoVadis of their CSR processes and performances. This plan is described in Section 2.5.8 Responsible purchasing and applies to tier 1 suppliers. The evaluation relates first and foremost to suppliers who have been identified as at-risk in the mapping exercise. Since 2017-2018, clauses have been added to contracts with subcontractors and suppliers stating that their CSR performance may be evaluated by Bonduelle and/or by EcoVadis.
In 2018-2019, Bonduelle prepared a due diligence questionnaire for its business partners to gain a better understanding of the measures they take to prevent vigilance risks. In 2019, the due diligence questionnaire is intended, based on risk mapping, for new business partners and those whose contracts are being renewed. Ultimately, the aim is to extend it to suppliers that the group already has dealings with.
Procedure for evaluating subsidiaries
Bonduelle Group subsidiaries are included within the scope of the EcoVadis implementation plan for the assessment of their suppliers. They are gradually implementing the responsible purchasing and monitoring policies and are assessed on the basis of their CSR performance as part of the group's reporting.

The whistleblowing procedure is open to group employees and outiside suppliers working on Bonduelle sites. The procedure put in place gives employees several options for reporting any concerns they may have: traditional, management and HR channels, as well as a website maintained and hosted by an external service

provider which gives access to an online form. The website is available to the whole group, except for the BFA business unit, which has a special helpline for historical reasons. Whatever channel is used, whistleblowers are guaranteed protection (including confidentiality) and follow-up on their report.
In 2019, as part of the update of the BRC Global Standard for Food Safety, Bonduelle began encouraging use of the whistleblowing procedure to report any issues linked to the safety, quality and legality of the products manufactured and distributed by the group.

Note on the CSR reporting methodology

2.9 Note on the CSR reporting methodology

2.9.1 Context and objectives ­
GRI 102-50, 102-48, 102-54
The analysis of the group's CSR performance is reported annually in this universal registration document.
Bonduelle increased its commitment to progress in sustainable development and CSR in 2002-2003, using a traditional phase-based project management methodology:
-- phase 1: set and validate objectives and communicate these throughout the organization;
-- phase 2: implement progress plans to achieve these objectives;
-- phase 3: measure and monitor the results.
Bonduelle's CSR reporting indicators have been drawn up by experts in the field in association with their exchange networks and approved by the operational teams. The indicators were chosen based on a combination of Bonduelle's CSR commitments and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option guidelines, as well as the expectations of stakeholders and the regulations set by the Grenelle environment act (France), culminating in the drafting of Bonduelle's own reporting guidelines.
This report was prepared in accordance with decree no. 20171265 of August 9, 2017, implementing ordinance no. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 on the publication of non-financial information by certain large companies and certain corporate groups. This report has also been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option (see Section 2.11 ­ Cross-reference table of the Corporate social responsibility report with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards Content Index). The components were reviewed in 2016-2017 according to the requirements of the GRI Standards: Core option and the priorities defined by the materiality initiative.
This document contains the Bonduelle Group's vigilance plan and the report on its actual implementation, pursuant to French law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 on the monitoring duties of parent companies and contracting companies.
Reporting has taken place every year since 2002-2003. This year the fiscal reporting period is from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. The indicators published in the universal registration document include the results of the past year and those from the previous four years to allow changes in indicators to be monitored. The reporting period may be adjusted or delayed by a few days depending on data availability.

The primary aim of reporting is to enable the group to enhance its sustainability management. The findings are analyzed by the CSR Steering Committee and the Bonduelle Group Management Committee to determine the objectives for the following year. The production facilities also have direct access to their indicators so that they can monitor and analyze their performance.
Pursuant to Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code, Deloitte, Co-Statutory Auditor, audited the information in the information in the non-financial performance statement published in Section 2 of the universal registration document.
This report contains neither modifications nor removals of material items of information provided in previous reports, except for the changes set out under Section 2.2.1.5.
2.9.2 Procedure ­ GRI 102-48
The group's CSR and Corporate Communication Director is responsible for overseeing reporting, in addition to the Managers of the areas concerned ­ human resources, agronomy, natural resources, quality and nutrition, transportation and purchasing ­ and by the CSR and Louis Bonduelle Foundation teams.
The data is collected annually by the correspondents on the sites and in the business units. The group's Management Consolidation Department checks and consolidates this data.
Covering the entire Bonduelle Group and most aspects of CSR, the Metrio® tool is used to input the data needed to calculate the indicators. Each user has their own personal access, depending on the plant and his or her area of responsibility in the report. Indicator definitions (scope, data requested, units and examples) can be accessed from the data entry interface. The results of the indicators are directly accessible to the report's contributors using tables and graphs. The group's production facilities can also compare their results with each other to encourage the exchange of best practice. The contributors to the reporting are trained in Metrio® and given assistance throughout the reporting process.
Human resources reporting (uses the COGNOS RH database tool) and calculations of CO2 emissions from transport are not yet calculated using the Metrio® reporting tool. The results are imported into Metrio® to consolidate the CSR indicators within the same tool.

Transport-related CO2 emissions are calculated based on kilometers traveled and tonnes transported, now monitored automatically and reported in real time. The group calculates CO2 emissions from transportation using the guidelines produced by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) in Europe, and the GHG Protocol for the BALL business unit (excluding transport of agricultural commodities, which is calculated using the ADEME protocol). The transport flows considered for upstream agricultural

activities represent only transportation of vegetable harvests from field to plant, and exclude transportation of vegetables purchased from suppliers.

2.9.4 Indicators ­ GRI 102-48
All quantitative reporting indicators can be found in the appendices, in a cross-reference table that also lists the GRI indicators and their correlation to the Grenelle initiatives. Section 2.7.6 of the Deloitte reports lists the indicators selected for verification work.

Individual interviews: the number of theoretical interviews is equal to the number of employees at June 30 of the prior year and the number of interviews completed is the number of interviews completed during the fiscal year.
2.9.4.3 Additional information for natural resource indicators

2.9.4.1 Additional information on an agronomy indicator
Bonduelle's upstream agricultural activities are mainly located in the Northern hemisphere and the growing seasons (sowing to harvesting) are typically in the period from Spring to Autumn. As such they cover two fiscal years. Consequently, in the majority of cases, in order to report actual data (crops actually harvested), Bonduelle uses the agricultural data from harvests during the calendar year prior to the reporting year.
Alternative cultivation techniques ­ mechanical weeding, sustainable fertilization (monitoring residual nitrogen), irrigation management (water balance or sensors), plant cover (before vegetables) and soil preservation techniques ­ do not apply to the Mushroom segment in Poland (hydroponic cultivation of button mushrooms). As such this segment has been excluded from the scope of reporting on alternative cultivation techniques.
The penetration rates for mechanical weeding, plant cover (before vegetables) and soil preservation techniques are calculated on the basis of all cultivated surface areas (excluding the Mushrooms in Poland segment).
The penetration rate for sustainable fertilization (monitoring residual nitrogen) is calculated on the basis of all cultivated surface areas excluding BALL in the United States and Canada and BELL in the South-West of France (and excluding the Mushrooms in Poland segment).

-- The hazardous waste production indicator is limited in scope: seven sites (Ruchocice, Reutlingen, Straelen, Cristalina, Ingersoll, Ste Martine and Strathroy) do not report the quantities of special industrial waste (SIW hazardous waste) generated or special industrial waste for which return has been negotiated with suppliers. These sites account for 12% of the group's annual production.
-- NOx, SOx and particulate emissions, mainly resulting from the operation of boilers, are monitored internally.
-- T COD treated in an external treatment plant and T COD released into the natural environment in accordance with regulations: the quantities released and following treatment in lagoons in Canada are accounted for in full under "quantities discharged into the natural environment in accordance with regulations".
-- tC02e from direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions: greenhouse gas emissions related to the consumption of biogas on site are taken to be zero; emissions related to the combustion of biomass have, on the other hand, been reported since 2017-2018.
-- Indicator of the type of packaging material: use of adhesive tape and the tracking of wooden pallets is not included in the packaging consumption indicator.

2.9.4.4 Additional information on transport indicators
The methods for calculating CO2 emissions for Bonduelle's freight transport were devised by supply chain teams working closely with the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) in 2009.
Following the enactment of Decree No. 2011-1336 on October 24, 2011, which establishes the calculation principles common to all modes of transport, and following the publication of the new European standard for the calculation and declaration of energy and greenhouse gas emissions from transport services (NF EN 16 258), Bonduelle has sought to comply with these principles and has revised the methods used for calculating emissions.
The calculation covers the carriage of goods (fuel consumption, which is higher in temperature-controlled vehicles due to the refrigeration unit) by road (trucks), rail or maritime freight. Truck manufacture and depreciation is not taken into account. Used only marginally by the group, air transport is not taken into consideration.
The assumptions used are:
-- road transportation: the maximum truck payload is taken to be 25 tonnes for a 40-tonne road tractor and for a 44-tonne tractor, with the following two exceptions:
· for upstream agricultural activities, the maximum
payload was considered equal to the maximum vegetable tonnage that can be transported, according to the density and crush resistance of the produce,
· for temperature controlled trucks (+4°), the maximum
payload was considered equal to 24 tonnes;
-- emissions generated by road transportation for the Fresh and Ready-to-eat prepared vegetables businesses are calculated according to the messaging model recommended in the ADEME guidelines, in three segments: collection, traction and distribution, taking into account the unladen distance in each of the collection and distribution segments. This model may be adjusted according to the actual logistics flows to optimize data monitoring. For fiscal year 2015-2016, the second segment includes the unladen distance for two-segment journeys in France and Italy, unlike for Germany. The supply chain teams work closely with the ADEME to devise a method common to each entity;
-- for distribution, unladen return journeys were taken to be equal to 21%, in accordance with ADEME guidelines.

Unladen return journeys were also taken to be 21% for picking when the actual distance was not known;
-- for the Canned and Frozen businesses, the gross weight transported (including the weight of additional packaging) is included in the emissions calculation, whereas the net product weight is used for the Fresh and Ready-to-eat prepared vegetables businesses, since there is no method for obtaining reliable data on the gross weight;
-- for maritime transport to Cameroon, an average container vessel of 1,900-3,849 TEU was considered, unless otherwise specified. For transport to Kenya and intercontinental transport, a container vessel of over 7,500 TEU is used;
-- rail transportation: for countries in Europe (France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom), it is assumed that rail transportation is powered by electricity. For other countries, it is assumed that trains mainly run on diesel.
Some marginal flows are not taken into account:
-- returns and sample orders;
-- customer orders dispatched by external suppliers;
-- purchasing of ingredients and raw materials and/or packaging;
-- credits due to returned goods;
-- intra-site orders that are not transported;
-- sales to brokers, donations, sales to employees, sales to colleagues;
-- other sales: disposal of end-of-line products or products that have reached the end of their minimum storage life.
The transportation of fresh products is handled in a specific way. When occasional troubleshooting is required (for example, due to a strike at the storage depot), the standard logistics model is used.
The method used by the BALL business unit is based on the GHG Protocol.
The following indicator is calculated at August 31, 2018: kg CO2 emitted per tonne transported.
2.9.4.5 Additional information for quality indicators
Number of tests conducted on fresh, ready-to-eat prepared and frozen vegetable product categories: product testing for listeria monocytogenes.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Note on the CSR reporting methodology

Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community applies to the Bonduelle Group for its European sites equipped with a boiler with a capacity of more than 20 MW. The Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) for the period 2013-2020 involves two Bonduelle sites: Estrées-Mons, Renescure (France), excluding the Vaulx-Vraucourt (France) site in 2015 following technical modifications.

For 2016, the allocation of free quotas equates to 19,352 tCO2e. Certified and transferred emissions totaled 16,207 tCO2e. The use of biomass steam in 2015 at the Estrées-Mons (France) site made it possible to halve the group's greenhouse gas emissions that are subject to the Emission trading scheme (ETS). Through energy savings made at its sites since 2008, Bonduelle has surplus allowances available in its account; as such it has not had to make purchases on the carbon allowance market since 2016.

2.10.3 Materiality matrix ­
GRI 102-46
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) challenges cover many areas. Not all of them have the same impact depending on the organizations and their stakeholders. The materiality analysis enables us to identify the economic, environmental, social and societal repercussions specific to an organization, and those that have a major influence on their stakeholders. In 2014-2015, Bonduelle initiated a materiality analysis approach in partnership with its stakeholders. In the first instance, a materiality matrix was created for the entire Bonduelle Group. Its methodology is used in all the countries

where Bonduelle operates. In 2015-2016, the matrix was completed in Canada and started in Italy. Russia devised its materiality matrix in 2016-2017.
The lessons learned from various dialogs with stakeholders in 2016-2017 supported the results of the matrix (see matrix in 1.3.2 Risks and challenges).
2.10.3.1 Identifying Bonduelle's CSR challenges
A complete list of Bonduelle's CSR challenges across its whole value chain was drawn up based on various existing guidelines (UN Global Compact, segment GRI, ISO 26000, Article 225 of the French Grenelle law), themes identified by other operators in the sector, topics dealt with during dialog with stakeholders in France and the materiality matrix produced in North America. This list of 51 challenges covers the different links in Bonduelle's value chain, from the agricultural upstream to consumers and civil society. The value chain is represented in the challenges and targets tables outlined in 2.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.4.1 and 2.5.1.
2.10.3.2 Consultation with stakeholders
External contacts involved in drawing up the "Importance for external stakeholders" item in Bonduelle's materiality matrix were identified so as to represent Bonduelle's various direct and indirect stakeholder categories. Among these categories, the most representative and relevant organizations, as well as renowned experts on matters relating to the Bonduelle Group's operations, were selected.

Bonduelle's internal stakeholders involved in producing the "Current or potential impact for Bonduelle" item were selected to reflect the group's overall strategic vision and its CSR vision. All members of the Executive Committee and the CSR Steering Committee answered the online questionnaire.

2.10.3.4 Materiality matrix ­ GRI 103-1
The materiality analysis (see matrix in 2.2.1.5 Materiality matrix) identified, from among Bonduelle's 51 CSR challenges, 17 major challenges shared by the group and its stakeholders. They include the commitments of the Company's CSR strategy and

will help to enrich it. They are also in step with the sustainable

2.10.3.3 Prioritizing challenges

development goals (see 2.2.1.4). Material challenges apply to

the entire Bonduelle Group, which collaborates with its eco-

An online questionnaire enabled stakeholders to rate the

system to address these challenges, and particularly with its

51 challenges on 6 different levels, give their opinions and

farmer partners:

indicate any other issues they considered relevant. None of the stakeholders added any challenges to the list, and all the challenges were considered important as they appear on the

-- product quality and safety (detailed in Sections 2.6.2.1 and 2.6.2.2);

matrix between levels 4 and 6.

-- food traceability (detailed in Section 2.6.2.1);

The final score for each challenge corresponds to an average calculated based on one vote allocated to each stakeholder category, without any weighting. This first score was complemented by:

-- workplace health and safety (detailed in Section 2.7.3.1); -- ethical business practice (detailed in Section 2.8.1); -- food safety (detailed in Section 2.6.2.1);

-- cross-referencing with the Bonduelle Group's risk mapping, to ensure consistency of the results with the Company's key risks. (risk management procedure outlined in Section 3.5);
-- inclusion of the results of surveys conducted on Bonduelle's suppliers and consumers. For example, the participation of Bonduelle's farmer suppliers was completed based on an IPSOS survey in 2014 of all of the group's partner producers;
-- the annual dialog session organized in France by Bonduelle. A group of some 30 key stakeholders was asked for their responses to the initial results of the matrix. The discussions dealt with the subjects already identified by Bonduelle, such as food waste and climate change. Additional points also came out of this dialog, such as crop diversity and promoting balanced food choices at work.
For each challenge, the Bonduelle CSR Steering Committee analyzes the results for each year via materiality matrices produced in the countries where Bonduelle operates.

-- compliance with international labor commitments (detailed in Sections 2.7.3.2 and 2.7.4.4);
-- relations with producers (detailed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5); -- soil preservation (detailed in Section 2.4); -- water preservation (detailed in Section 2.5.5); -- responsible packaging (detailed in Section 2.5.4); -- water pollution (detailed in Section 2.5.5); -- use of agricultural inputs (detailed in Section 2.4.2); -- legal compliance (detailed in Section 2.8.1); -- compliance of teams with the group's CSR commitments
(detailed in Section 2.1.1.2); -- integration of CSR challenges in relations with customers
(detailed in Section 2.6.3.2); -- nutritional composition of products (detailed in

The Supervisory Board of Bonduelle SCA has eight members. Its Chairman, Martin Ducroquet, has also been responsible for Shareholder dialog since September 28, 2018.
At the meeting on February 28, 2019, Marie-France Tisseau, who had been in office since 2011, expressed her wish to step down for personal reasons. The Chairman accepted and endorsed her resignation and thanked her warmly, on behalf of the entire Board, for her great commitment and input throughout her term of office. The co-optation of JeanMichel Thierry, as a member of the Supervisory Board and member of the Audit Committee, was proposed to the Board which voted unanimously in favor of said co-optation, with effect from the end of said meeting and for the remainder of Marie-France Tisseau's term of office, i.e. for a one-year period, expiring at the end of the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting

At its meeting on September 27, 2019, the Supervisory Board noted that seven of its eight members were independent under the independence criteria set by the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure drawn from the Afep-Medef Code. Isabelle Danjou, having served for 12 successive years on December 6, 2018, lost her independent status on this criterion alone.
The Shareholders' Meeting will be asked to ratify the provisional appointment of Jean-Michel Thierry as a member of the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board supports the General Management's proposal to pay a gross dividend of 0.50 euro per share.
In conclusion, there are no observations to make regarding the financial statements presented and the resolutions proposed do not require any comments from the Supervisory Board. A proposal is made to the Shareholders' Meeting to renew the expiring authorizations and delegations granted to the General Management by previous Shareholders' Meetings.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
In accordance with the law and the provisions of the Articles of association, the Supervisory Board is composed of between 3 and 18 members selected from among the Shareholders who do not qualify as General Partners and are neither the legal representative of the General Partner nor the Manager of Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS. Supervisory Board members are appointed by an Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting for a period of three years.

3.3.1 Corporate Governance Code
At its December 4, 2008 meeting, the Supervisory Board of the Bonduelle Group adopted the principles of the AfepMedef Corporate Governance Code.
It was observed that some provisions do not apply to French limited partnerships with shares (particularly point 3 of the Afep-Medef Code, on the different ways in which governance can be organized), due, in particular, to the role of the Supervisory Board in the decision-making process (particularly, point 1.2 of the Afep-Medef Code, on Boards of Directors of public limited companies). The Code's provisions in relation to the Nomination and Compensation Committee are no longer

Its current composition is described in 3.2.2.
Duties of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is responsible for the permanent control of the management of the Company. These duties cover the following areas: -- reviewing the preparation and control of accounting and
financial information; -- reviewing the Company's financial position, cash position
and commitments (whilst reviewing the annual and interim financial statements or as often as is needed); -- reviewing the annual and interim financial statements closed by the General Management;

Information on the functioning of the Supervisory Board

-- assessing the correctness and appropriateness of the Company's management;
-- assessing the means employed by the Company to measure and monitor its exposure to risks (particularly as part of its risk mapping);
-- assessing compliance with Shareholder rights. The Supervisory Board must be assured of the relevance, balance, comparability, reliability, clarity and instructional nature of the information provided to Shareholders and to the financial markets, particularly with regard to strategy, growth model, how the Company deals with material non-financial issues as well as its long-term outlook, in accordance with current accounting standards;
-- issuing an annual report in which it reports, in particular, on any irregularities and inaccuracies noted in the parent company financial statements and consolidated financial statements;
-- issuing a corporate governance report.
Functioning of the Supervisory Board
The Articles of association stipulate that the Supervisory Board shall meet as often as required in the interests of the Company, and the rules of procedure set the minimum number of meetings at four.
The Supervisory Board may, at its discretion, request the participation of General Management, the group's Executive Management, the Chief Executive Officers of the business units, the Statutory Auditors, the group Chief Financial Officer, the Internal Audit Director, the group Legal Director or any other employee in such meetings, to consolidate its reflections and ensure its mission.
It may also call upon outside experts or consultants of its choosing, with the related expense to be borne by the Company.
To detail the conditions under which the Supervisory Board prepares and organizes its work, the Board has drafted rules of procedure that also describe the rights and obligations of its members. These rules of procedure were updated at its meeting on December 7, 2017.
Specialized committees
The Supervisory Board may set up one or more committees from amongst its members charged with looking into important issues that require careful consideration. It may decide to bring in non-members of the Supervisory Board to serve on these committees, apart from the Audit Committee.
The Board decided to create an Audit Committee, comprised of at least three, and no more than five, Supervisory Board members, for which the competence criteria are defined by law and are set out in the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board and the rules under which the Audit Committee operates.

This Committee is charged of preparing the meetings of the Supervisory Board, notably with respect to the following points:
-- oversight of the preparation of financial disclosures by making recommendations, where appropriate, to ensure their completeness;
-- monitoring the efficiency of internal control and risk management systems and, where applicable, internal audit systems, regarding the procedures for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial reporting, without affecting its independence;
-- making a recommendation regarding the Statutory Auditors proposed for appointment by the Shareholders' Meeting;
-- monitoring the performance of the Statutory Auditors in their duties, in consideration, where applicable, of the observations and conclusions of France's supervisory body for Auditors, the Haut Conseil du Commissariat aux Comptes;
-- approving the Statutory Auditors' provision of non-audit services;
-- the independence of the Statutory Auditors and, in particular, compliance with rules governing the appointment of Statutory Auditors and their terms of office.
When performing its duties, the Audit Committee draws on the recommendations of the Poupart Lafarge report of July 22, 2010, published under the auspices of the Autorité des marchés financiers (French financial markets authority ­ AMF).
Conflicts of interest
The Supervisory Board's rules of procedure set out procedures for managing conflicts of interest within the Board.
In a situation suggesting, or that might suggest, a direct or indirect conflict between the Company's interest and the member's personal interest or the interest of the Shareholder or the group of Shareholders that the member represents, the Supervisory Board member in question must:
-- inform the Supervisory Board as soon as the conflict of interest is known;
-- draw any conclusions as to the performance of duties. Depending on the circumstances, the member must:
· either abstain from voting on the corresponding
resolution,
· or stop attending Supervisory Board meetings during the
period in which the member has a conflict of interest,
· or resign from the role of member of the Supervisory
Board.
Should these abstention or withdrawal rules not be respected, the member of the Board may be held liable.
In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall not be obliged to send information or documents appertaining to the contentious issue to the member(s) of the Supervisory Board if

4 REPORT OF THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT
Activity and performance
Introduction
Bonduelle Group 2018-2019 revenue stood at 2,777.1 million euros, stable compared with the previous fiscal year, the consumer environment proving to be fragile in a number of regions. Current operating income was also almost unchanged at 123.7 million euros, despite a challenging 2018 harvest. The acquisition of the Del Monte brand, which contributed both to revenue and profitability over the period, and the acquisition of frozen food processing and packaging facilities in the USA and Russia, reflect the group's capacity to selectively seize the opportunities offered by this demanding economic climate. In a consumer environment that was still volatile and quite sluggish in some regions, and against the backdrop of unfavorable weather conditions, the Bonduelle Group once again proved its resilience and the agility of its teams.

4.1 Activity and performance

4.1.1 Revenue
Group revenue stood at 2,777.1 million euros at the end of the 2018-2019 fiscal year (July 1, 2018 ­ June 30, 2019), stable compared with the previous year based on reported figures. This change includes the contribution made by the Del Monte business acquired early on in the fiscal year (+1.2%) and the net foreign currency impact (+0.3%). Negative growth on a likefor-like basis(1) (-1.5%) was entirely due to the trend in the fresh vegetables segment in the United States, the group's other businesses recording growth of +2.8% at constant scope and exchange rates.
Europe Zone
The Europe Zone, accounting for 47% of the group's revenue, recorded annual growth of +0.5% based on reported figures, and +0.7% on a like-for-like basis(1).
Bonduelle and Cassegrain brand business continued to grow by volume and revenue in the different segments ­ canned, frozen, ready-to-use and ready-to-eat fresh vegetables ­ on

relatively sluggish markets. The group increased its market share as a result of numerous innovations ­ pan-European launches and rollouts ­ in the plant-based food world, combining vegetables, grains and pulses in different forms and designed to meet different consumption opportunities.
Non-Europe Zone
The Non-Europe Zone, accounting for 53% of the group's revenue, recorded a drop of -0.4% based on reported figures and -3.4% on a like-for-like basis(1) in 2018-2019.
This trend in the fresh vegetables segment in North America was due to the fact that a major client diversified its sourcing from the 2nd quarter of the year and the streamlining of the product portfolio (production of sliced fruit halted and production of bagged salads). At the same time, this same region's canned and frozen vegetable segments saw robust growth, fueled both by internal growth and by the acquisition of the Del Monte brand in Canada, which is performing as expected. Additional frozen vegetable packaging capacities were incorporated via the acquisition of the Lebanon site (Pennsylvania-USA).

(1) On a like-for-like basis, i.e. at a constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:
1 for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period, revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;
1 for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year, revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;
1 for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year, revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;
1 for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year, revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.

Activity and performance

The Eurasia region was extremely buoyant during the period due to the success of new product ranges such as baby sweet corn, jars of precooked vegetables (with investment in a jar line) and canned olives. This momentum will be bolstered next year by the frozen vegetables segment, produced locally following the acquisition of the Belgorod plant (Russia).

4.1.3 Net income
The financial result stood at -22.6 million euros, compared with -25.3 million euros the previous year, or a 2.7 million euro decrease in financial expenses linked to a break-even currency result and competitive refinancing via a 140 million euro USPP put in place over the fiscal year.

4.1.2 Operating income
In 2018-2019, the Bonduelle Group's current operating profitability stood at 123.7 million euros, up from 123.6 million euros the previous year, stable based on reported figures, and maintaining its current operating margin at 4.5%.

losses for compensation relating to a public health warning impacting the group in the United States and Canada, resulting in a 4.5 million euro expense. Although it did not concern products sold by Bonduelle, this warning from the US and Canadian authorities resulted in loss of revenue and additional costs which were, in part, compensated for by the group's insurance company under its contamination policy.
After taking these non-recurring items into consideration, the Bonduelle Group's operating income stood at 115.8 million euros, compared with 119.0 million euros the previous year, stable after restatement for the impact of the public health crisis mentioned above.

Optimizing Bonduelle Group capital employed is a priority; a number of tools have been used to raise each employee's awareness of this, including the Finance for Growth initiative. By defining performance measurement indicators for the main financial aggregates and sharing them internally, on a regular basis, and by training employees and talking to them about the challenges faced, the Bonduelle Group effectively manages its working capital requirement, and its investments in general.
Despite the fact that the Bonduelle Group finalized three acquisitions over the fiscal year, the capital employed (total Shareholders' equity and net financial debt) recorded a

moderate year-on-year increase, reaching 1,379.7 million

euros.

At June 30, 2019, the ratio of return on capital employed (ROCCE(1)) stood at 9.0%, down 80 bps on the previous fiscal year.

4.1.6 Financial debt and leverage ratio
In a context of multiple acquisitions in 2018-2019, the group's net financial debt was up slightly at June 30, 2019, at 654.7 million euros, from 617.4 million euros the previous year. Reflecting the sound financial structure, gearing improved again, standing at 90.3%, compared with 95.4% at June 30, 2018, whilst the leverage ratio (net debt/recurring EBITDA)

stood at 3.07 compared with 2.91 in 2017-2018. The widespread low interest rate environment enabled the group to refinance the EuroPP maturing in March 2019 under particularly attractive terms. The average cost of debt continued to fall and now stands at 2.41% compared with 2.65% in 2018-2019.
The group holds 444,544 treasury shares, giving an equivalent value based on the share price on June 30, 2019, i.e. 28.80 euros, of 12.8 million euros, and this amount of treasury shares has therefore been deducted from equity, in accordance with IFRS.

4.1.7 Highlights
Communication related to the September 27, 2019 European Commission decision
On September 27, 2019, the European Commission adopted its decision on sanctions against various players of certain market segments of canned vegetables in Europe.
As part of the Commission's investigations into this 2000s market practices, and as mentioned in its registration documents since the 2013-2014 fiscal year, the Bonduelle Group applied to the Commission for immunity from fines and obtained, on September 24, 2013, conditional immunity under this procedure. The decision of the Commission confirms financial penalties exemption for the group.
As a reminder, in 2013, Bonduelle adopted, in all its business segments, an antitrust training program onboarding its employees, completed by a whistleblowing system. These principles, assembled in a Charter of Ethics, are a day-today guide for all the teams and a benchmark for the Ethics Committee.
Acquisition of a frozen food plant in Russia
On June 3, 2019, the Bonduelle Group announced that it had acquired the industrial assets of the frozen vegetable producer, LLC SHOCK, in the region of Belgorod (Russia).

Located in an agricultural region that is renowned for its temperate climate and particularly fertile soil (blackcentral soil), this industrial site will accelerate the expansion of Bonduelle's frozen vegetable business in these same markets, through high-quality production.
This production site, with an initial acquisition cost of around 7 million euros and a limited investment requirement, will make it possible to process between 6,000 and 10,000 tonnes of frozen vegetables a year. About 50 permanent employees will work at the site and in partnership with the local agricultural community, developing its know-how in terms of environmentally-friendly agricultural practices.
Bonduelle successfully issued a new private bond on the US market (USPP)
Looking for additional maturity for its financing and for the refinancing of the EuroPP maturing on March 11, 2019, on May 2, 2019, Bonduelle issued a new 140 million euro private placement in the United States (USPP) with a 10-year maturity. This took the average maturity of the group's overall debt to over four years.
Operating on the USPP market since 2000, Bonduelle issued this private placement under particularly attractive terms to a pool of existing investors who confirmed their confidence in the group. Largely oversubscribed, this transaction enabled the group to significantly reduce the cost of its debt.
Bonduelle was advised by Natixis, acting as agent, and by Willkie Farr & Gallagher, acting as legal adviser.

Bonduelle continues to expand its frozen food business in the United States with the acquisition of the Lebanon plant
On February 12, 2019, the Bonduelle Group announced that it had reached a definitive agreement with the US company Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ: SENEA, SENEB) to acquire its Lebanon plant (Pennsylvania, USA).

Crucial when it comes to consolidating its reputation, enhancing its image and unifying its stakeholders around a common vision, this signature tagline also rises to the challenge of reassuring its public and pursuing its three goals: to inform, to improve understanding of the meaning of its actions and to develop attachment to the Company and its commitments.

This plant, which is used for packaging frozen products, was built in 2008 and acquired by Seneca in 2010. It has a capacity of 45,000 tonnes on seven packaging lines which are all in perfect working order. It has a large storage capacity and has 140 permanent employees.
The Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) business unit which, until recently, had a limited capacity for expansion, has thus increased its frozen food production facilities in North America, now with four industrial units on the East coast of the United States and six in Canada. As well as the additional packaging capacity generating revenue, this acquisition will allow both industrial and logistical synergies with existing facilities and will improve the quality of the service offered to

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Through its business, directly linked with the agriculture sector, through its products, a natural basis for nutrition, and through its ethics, built over generations on a foundation of essential values, the Bonduelle Group has always placed particular importance on what has come to be called sustainable development.
Firmly anchored in the group's strategy and practices, in 2018-2019, Bonduelle's CSR policies underpinned its forwardthinking ethos and its international reach. In line with the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the group's expansion, the scope of CSR issues has broadened.

On June 25, 2019, Bonduelle's Communication on CSR Progress was recognized in the GC Advanced category by the Global Compact France. The jury commended the informative nature and the clarity and transparency of the group's CSR report. It assessed the use of environmental criteria in investment decisions, the agronomic sourcing charter and information on the deployment of an ethics culture.

This co-optation will be subject to ratification, at the latest, at

the Shareholders' Meeting on December 5, 2019.

Transparency and recognition

Institutional communications
By 2050, there will be nine billion people to be fed. This timing means that the plant-based food revolution is now unavoidable, and justifies the Bonduelle Group's ambition, driven by its transformation plan, VegeGo!, to be, by 2025: "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food".
At the halfway mark on this plan's road map, the group wants its public to know about its ambition to work together to make a better future through plant-based food and, as a result, is keen to develop its institutional communications, in particular, via its signature tagline: La nature, notre futur.

As part of our commitment to progress in terms of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), in 2012, the group obtained Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) application level B+ for its CSR report. Since 2015 this report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards: Core option. Deloitte, Co-Statutory Auditor, performed work to verify the social, environmental and societal information presented in this document.
Bonduelle has been part of the GaÏa index, a listing of the best mid-caps in terms of sustainable development, since 2009, and maintained a favorable overall rating, at 77% and ranked in 32nd place out of the 85 companies with revenue in excess of 500 million euros (results published in October 2018). The Bonduelle Group is also listed on the Euronext IAS index (employee share ownership index).

Activity and performance

In 2018, Bonduelle was short-listed for an award for its CSR reporting, along with four other finalists, at the European Business Awards for the environment. This award, organized by the European Commission, celebrates companies at the forefront of eco-innovation or that have positioned respect for the environment at the very core of their business principles.
Co-construction with stakeholders
Bonduelle has been committed to a proactive policy of reducing its environmental footprint caused by its production sites, packaging and transport of its products since 2003. Proper water management, as well as saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are priorities for the Company. These historical strategic focus areas were confirmed in a materiality matrix drawn up with its stakeholders (see Section 2.2.1.5 Materiality matrix). The matrix is a tool that identifies the group's CSR priority areas for improvement.
The group's desire is to encourage high-quality dialog with all stakeholders. This human dimension has always motivated Bonduelle, a family company that respects communication and honesty, values upon which the Company's reputation was built (see Section 2.2.1.6 Procedure for dialog with stakeholders).
Dialog with the general public
Since its creation, Bonduelle has been a partner of the World Forum for a responsible economy. The event is held every October in France. The theme of the 2019 World Forum is Ego imperium, I have the power to change the world". This is Bonduelle's opportunity to showcase its commitments and encourage its employees to follow all Forum events.
In addition, for its fourth participation in France's largest agriculture trade fair, the Salon international de l'agriculture (International Agricultural Fair) in Paris, Bonduelle's goal was to present its manifesto and its responsible commitments, the high point being the launch of its first no pesticides residue products. The trade fair was an important opportunity for Bonduelle, farmer partners and consumers to share views. Each day, Bonduelle's farmer partners were there to talk to the general public about their profession, and to explain the production process used for vegetables, open field lettuce or mushrooms.
Corporate commitment to local communities
Bonduelle has prioritized participation in local communities where its plants operate. The objective is to galvanize employees and help make local communities a better place to live. Depending on its specific characteristics, each production facility plans to develop at least one project in partnership with local stakeholders (see 2.7.6.1 Participating in local community life and rallying employees).
As for the Louis Bonduelle Foundation, this was established in 2004 as a result of the group's desire to contribute to public

health challenges relating to nutrition. Its aim is to foster a permanent change in eating habits in all the countries where Bonduelle operates. Through its company foundation, the group is launching a call for projects to support local initiatives whose aim is to improve eating habits (see 2.6.3.1 Healthy and sustainable food information and awareness-raising actions).
Promotion of diversity
Employee diversity is important for Bonduelle. It is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination in the workplace and in employee relations, both direct and indirect. This antidiscrimination policy applies to all stages of employment, from hiring through an entire career. It is accompanied by measures intended to promote diversity (see 2.7.4.3 Diversity) and is reflected in changes to the group's Executive Management and governance bodies.
Sustainable use of resources
In 2014-2015, the Bonduelle Group conducted large-scale mapping of its water use at all stages of its agro-industrial process and across its entire scope of consolidation. The aim was to define a sustainable, integrated water management policy in line with a long-term vision of water availability, covering both quantitative and qualitative factors.
For production facilities, water is an energy in the same way as steam, electricity or compressed air. Its management is included in international standard ISO 50001 on energy management. Developments in industrial supervision also involve water management. Bonduelle also controls the amount of effluent produced by its industrial operations, where necessary, by purifying the wastewater discharged from its waste treatment plants or from agricultural spreading (see 2.5.3 Preservation of water resources through sustainable and integrated management of the water cycle).
Bonduelle has a proactive carbon footprint reduction policy for its use of other types of energy (see 2.5.2.1 The Bonduelle Group's greenhouse gas emissions assessment: a key baseline). The first initiative involves replacing the most polluting forms of energy in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Heavy fuel oil has not, therefore, been used in the Company since 2013-2014. The second priority involves the use of local alternative energies such as biomass and biogas. The group's objective is to support innovative projects in order to promote the use of local alternative energy. For example, 93% of green waste at the Bonduelle site in Renescure (France) is methanized in a neighboring agricultural plant, in line with a circular economy model: the agricultural plant produces heat, which is then sold to another local agri-food company. Other examples are investment in cogeneration in the United States or photovoltaics in Portugal.
Waste prevention and management
Details of the reduction in the amount of waste discharged by Bonduelle's industrial activities are given in Section 2.5.5 Waste management: zero loss and circular economy.

Change to Soléal's Shareholder structure (France)
In July 2019, Bonduelle, a 48% Shareholder in Soléal, acquired most of the interests held in the company by the Euralis, Maïsadour and Vivadour cooperatives.
Created in 2005 in the form of a joint venture, Soléal has two sweet corn and vegetable processing plants in Labenne and Bordères in Southwestern France. This change to Soléal's ownership includes some sourcing commitments, thereby strengthening its long-term partnership with growers, and will make the Bonduelle Group more competitive.

Risk factors

Production stoppage during peak times
Description
Since a large percentage of Bonduelle's business is seasonal, production stoppage in peak times, in particular, at times when raw materials arrive in bulk at the plant (harvest time), may be particularly damaging for Bonduelle.
This risk could arise as a result of the destruction of a production tool (fire, explosion, natural disaster at an industrial production facility or a logistics platform, etc.), an accident, pollution or the presence of a bacterium requiring specific treatment and the shutdown of the plant in question. Production stoppage at peak times may have adverse consequences for Bonduelle's business and employees (temporary layoffs), the availability of Bonduelle products and the group's reputation, depending on the origins of the shutdown, and may have a future impact on the group's results.

Risk management
Rigorous measures are taken, on a permanent basis, to protect the group's strategic assets and, in particular, its production tools. The fact that production facilities are distributed across various regions ranging from the West Coast of the United States to the Urals, limits the consequences of production stoppage in peak times. On a group level, production facilities were mapped to assess the level of prevention at each facility according to the strategic nature of the site. This mapping enables risk prevention plans to be prepared (in particular, fire prevention). An audit program, in conjunction with our insurer, means that these risks can be reassessed. A dedicated team is responsible for ensuring that the prevention plan is applied and that the implementation of recommendations is monitored. The business units implement industrial tool maintenance plans which are regularly reviewed between each harvest. The facilities have teams specifically tasked with maintaining and repairing production tools. Following the audits piloted by the group, progress plans were also put in place. In addition, the Bonduelle Group has international insurance policies covering the group's assets as well as operating losses resulting from damages.

Dependency on third parties

Description

Risk management

Concentration of distribution

Bonduelle primarily sells its products to consumers(1) through intensely concentrated mass-market retailing, negotiating via purchasing groups. This situation makes the group potentially vulnerable during trade negotiations, with the risk of being delisted.

Diversifying our brands and the countries in which we sell (over 100 countries) and seeking other distribution channels, mitigates this risk.

Dependency on suppliers and raw material-related risks

The group procures its raw materials and packaging (metal cans, in particular) from farmers and external suppliers. For some direct and indirect purchases, these supplies are procured from a limited number of market operators. Should these suppliers fail, seeking alternatives may prove complex and/or costly, possibly resulting in negative impacts on results and business. There is, moreover, no organized market for the agricultural raw materials purchased by the Bonduelle Group. Changes in the prices of agricultural raw materials quoted on a market do, however, have a more or less significant impact on the group's purchase prices, depending on the agricultural alternatives available to producers.

The group's sourcing policy is to reduce risks by using several economic operators in the narrowest segments. In order to ensure long-term relationships with its vegetable suppliers, Bonduelle holds annual negotiations with producers' associations well in advance of the harvest, principally on the basis of a net margin per hectare for the producer. Bonduelle is, therefore, forced to adjust its selling prices to reflect the result of vegetable purchasing negotiations, which vary from one sourcing region to another, to maintain the Company's financial equilibrium.

A sudden change in consumers' eating habits and Bonduelle's failure to anticipate such changes, could have an impact on the attractiveness of Bonduelle's products and distribution and, in the future, could have a negative impact on its businesses and revenue.

Bonduelle's range, which is firmly based on the growing attraction of plant-based products, is 100% consumer-focused. Eating habits and tastes are monitored and this extends as far as an innovation policy directed at products responding to new eating habits and new consumption and purchasing patterns. The Bonduelle Group has implemented a pro-active innovation policy, reflected in its product portfolio by the fact that 9.6% of products were launched in the last three years. In response to consumers' demand for naturalness, Bonduelle has expanded its organic range across all four business segments and is pioneering no pesticides residue vegetables. The group has also reduced, and is planning to further reduce, its use of additives and preservatives. Bonduelle is also doing its utmost to design more ecological and more responsible products and packaging. 95% of its products are recyclable. Bonduelle is supporting consumers' desire to switch to plantbased products by offering, in addition to the usual vegetable ingredients or accompaniments, real plant-based alternatives providing tasty and filling main courses (VeggissiMmm', Legumio). Bonduelle is also increasing its presence in all thriving retail channels ("on the go", discounters, e-commerce). Although Bonduelle is already a major presence in the food service market, it is expanding its innovative ranges (e.g.: nuggets) and services (e.g.: Greenology), thereby enabling catering professionals to increasingly make plant-based foods the centerpiece of their meals in response to new customer trends.

Soil not suitable for agricultural purposes
Description
Arable land is farmed by Bonduelle and its partner farmers to produce the plants which are used in its products. As a result of certain intensive models of farming land for agriculture, combined with other human, climatic, industrial factors, etc., and should Bonduelle's desired transition to agroecology not happen quickly enough, or go far enough, some of this land could prove not to be suitable for agriculture or for the production of raw materials that meet Bonduelle's quality and health requirements. In the first instance, this soil impoverishment may result in drops in productivity and competitiveness for Bonduelle, its partner farmers, its distributor customers and neighboring communities. In the future, a loss of quality surface areas could lead, in extreme cases, to food insecurity for local communities.

Risk management
To mitigate this risk, Bonduelle operates in a number of countries and continents. In addition, Bonduelle is developing policies to adapt to these changes (for example, by trialing new varieties). In addition, Bonduelle is committed to, and requires its stakeholders to commit to, preserving soil quality over time. As a result, since 1996 Bonduelle has had a Global sourcing charter. It sets the rules with which all partner producers must comply. It is a contractual commitment covering the process from seed to harvest to ensure that Bonduelle's specifications are strictly adhered to and covering plot selection, choice of varieties and cultivation methods. To preserve the soil and natural resources, rotations tailored to different crops and areas are defined, phytosanitary treatment decisions are taken on a curative, rather than a preventive, basis and equipment to optimize water use is prioritized. Bonduelle's agricultural experts support producer partners at every stage of cultivation. Bonduelle also aims to roll out alternative growing practices with the aim of protecting the soil across 100% of the surface areas farmed for its businesses. Details of Bonduelle's agricultural policy are provided in Section 2.4 Caring, with our farmer partners, for cultivated land.

Risk factors

Cybercrime and risks of information system failure
Description
Bonduelle's business depends on information systems, in particular, its industrial (recording transactions, monitoring stocks, product traceability, etc.), sales, marketing and financial activities. The main risks associated with the dependency of these systems are the risk of fraud, cyber attacks and hacking that may result in loss of access to information systems, the alteration, loss, disclosure or destruction of data and possibly the highjacking of network-connected machines by cybercriminals, the deterioration or loss of access and security of infrastructures and services as well as a reduction in, or lack of, data access, integrity and confidentiality. Should information systems crash, whether due to technical failure or malicious intent, there may be an impact on the work of Bonduelle's internal teams or partners and/or on its activities, in terms of its industrial, sales and marketing activities which may, in the future, have financially, economically and operationally damaging consequences. There may be financial consequences in the event of fraud. In addition, should data be lost or personal data breached, Bonduelle's reputation and image may be damaged, even if it is not at fault.

Risk management
Information system security risks have been mapped and a continuous IT security improvement policy put in place. An information systems security officer (RSSI), reporting to the group Information Systems Department (DSI), is responsible for security audits which are conducted on an annual basis by external Auditors and the DSI. Action plans and an investment program were piloted by the group RSSI to increase security and oversight of information systems and to protect data in line with ongoing changes in this regard. Awareness is also raised among employees about the risks of hacking or willful damage. Awareness-raising sessions, as well as a number of practical guides to IT security are provided to limit the internal risk of involuntary disclosure of confidential information or hacking. The group's personal data protection policies (for example, those relating to the application of the GDPR) are just some of the organizational, technical and security measures put in place to protect personal data and data in general.

Risk factors

Geopolitical climate and geographical breakdown of activities
Description
Bonduelle operates in 12 countries and makes sales and/or purchases in over 100 countries. As a result, 47% of Bonduelle's 2018-2019 revenue was generated in Europe, 46% in the Americas, 6% in Eurasia and 1% from exports. The group's employees and businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by periods of economic, political or financial instability in some regions (wars, revolutions, major industrial disputes, devaluation, loss of funding for farmers, etc.). Changes in economic, political or regulatory conditions, or a crisis in some of the countries in which it operates, would expose Bonduelle to risks to its business, its assets, its employees, its financial position and its reputation.

Risk management
Bonduelle's international expansion has led to geographical spread, diversifying and limiting the concentration of this risk in any given country. When a country risk is identified, wherever possible, the Bonduelle Group Insurance Department seeks insurance coverage to limit the financial impact. Potential country risks are also taken into consideration when investments are chosen and locations are selected for industrial, scientific and business assets: ease of foreign trade, political stability, protection of intellectual property, etc.

Protection of know-how
Description
With an agro-industrial history dating back over 160 years, Bonduelle's agricultural and industrial know-how is unique. In addition, its innovation and R&D-oriented strategy means that new technical procedures and know-how are developed and acquired every day. In a highly competitive economic climate and a complex and fast-moving environment, protecting the availability of Bonduelle's resources, knowledge and technical know-how, and keeping it confidential, are essential. Disclosure of this know-how and/or its loss exposes Bonduelle to litigation risk and may have an impact, depending on the markets involved, on Bonduelle's competitiveness, strategy, sustainability, business and, in future, its results.

Risk management
Protecting know-how is key to the group's strategy. To protect and ensure the long-term retention of its assets, Bonduelle has prepared a map of its critical and/or unique know-how. It applies an active policy of continuity of know-how to ensure the long-term retention and transmission of such know-how and protects its resources and innovations via legal means such as exclusivity and non-compete agreements and by registering drawings and models or filing patents. This policy is also reflected in measures to raise awareness of, and prevent, risks of leaks and losses of information (confidentiality guide). Lastly, Bonduelle applies a pro-active policy aimed at protecting, building loyalty and setting out succession plans for its key people.

Financial, legal and hedging policy risks
4.3 Financial, legal and hedging policy risks

Bonduelle is faced with some financial and legal risks in addition to than those shown in Section 4.2 Risk factors and for which the net risk is very low due, in particular, to hedging and risk management policies.

Note 5.6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2019).
The Company specifically reviewed its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future payments.

4.3.1 Financial risks
The group has established an organization that provides for centralized management of all of its liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty credit risks. The Finance Department has assigned the group Finance and Treasury Department responsibility for risk management, and provided it with all of the expertise and tools needed to participate in the various financial markets as effectively and safely as possible. The organization and procedures utilized are regularly reviewed by the Internal Audit Department and the Statutory Auditors. At meetings held regularly with the Chief Financial Officer and Finance and Treasury Direction, the group's Executive Management validates, on the basis of a report published monthly, the implementation of previously authorized management strategies.
In a rapidly changing global economic environment, characterized by market volatility and changes in financial techniques, the role of the group Finance and Treasury Department is to:
-- ensure optimum and sufficient funding to finance the development and growth of the group's operating activities;
-- identify, evaluate and hedge all financial risks in close collaboration with the operations teams.
The objective is to minimize, at the lowest possible cost, the impact of financial market fluctuations on the group's income statement, in order to reduce the capital allocation required to manage these financial risks.
The group prohibits the taking of speculative positions.
4.3.1.1 Liquidity risk
The group Finance Department is responsible for maintaining sufficient liquidity at all times. It accomplishes this by efficiently managing the group's cash balances and ensuring that the maturity and conditions of the financing obtained are appropriate. In particular, it arranges confirmed lines of credit to maximize the flexibility of the group's financing (see

4.3.1.2 Market risks
Currency risk
Risks related to changes in foreign exchange rates The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in euros, and in 2018-2019, 45.4% of revenue and 40.3% of current operating income were denominated in euros.
The share of assets, liabilities, sales and earnings denominated in other currencies ­ essentially the Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Russian ruble, Brazilian real and US and Canadian dollars ­ fluctuates continuously. This means that the group is affected by fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the euro when they are translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements. For example, when the euro appreciates against these currencies it reduces the earnings contribution from those subsidiaries whose financial statements are denominated in these currencies.
All sales and expenses of group subsidiaries are generally expressed in their local currency, with the exception of imports, exports and financial transactions covered by centralized and systematic foreign currency hedges, where the type of exposure means that it can be hedged: Bonduelle therefore believes that its local exposure to currency fluctuations, after hedging, is limited.
The group's international growth strategy contributes to increasing the weight of non euro-denominated activities in revenue, operating income and consolidated net income.
Hedging policies for currency risk The aim is to hedge risks relating to the activities of its subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than their functional currency and risks relating to the financing of some subsidiaries operating in countries whose functional currency is not the euro; the asset/liability structure of the financing is created by natural matching or by putting financial instruments in place.
The group uses over-the-counter financial instruments only to hedge the financial risks generated by its production and sales activities. All hedges entered into must comply with

Counterparty credit risk
In its dealings in financial assets in general and any cash balances, the group works only with highly-rated bank counterparties. Any cash surpluses are generally managed in short-term interest-bearing deposits.
4.3.1.3 Equity management
The Bonduelle Group always ensures that its financial structure remains optimal by respecting the balance between its net financial debt and its equity, and by maintaining a consistent dividend policy. This is intended to keep the cost of capital to a minimum, to maximize share price and dividend growth for the Shareholders and to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise.

4.3.3.1 Agro-industrial and commercialrelated risks
Bonduelle complies with all applicable laws and regulations in its relationships with its partners. As a member of the food industry, Bonduelle is subject to national and international regulations, notably concerning food safety, quality control, food products and packaging.
The main legal risks are associated with the manufacture and distribution of food products. Bonduelle considers that it has set up sufficient measures to meet regulatory requirements and prevent and manage these risks.

4.3.3.2 Intellectual and industrial property
Rigorous measures are employed to protect Bonduelle intellectual property. Internal teams assisted by intellectual property consultants monitor Bonduelle Group brands, register and renew protection and take action against third parties in the event of trademark infringements.
4.3.3.3 Other risks
Bonduelle's sales and industrial activities are not significantly dependent upon other companies, customers or suppliers, and the group has the assets it needs to for its activities.
To the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no government, court or arbitration proceedings pending or threatened that might have, or that have had, over the past 12 months, a material effect on the financial position or profitability of the Company and/or the group, apart from those mentioned in Note 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
4.3.4 Coverage of non-financial risks
The Company's policies serve three strategic goals set by the family Shareholder whose stability over time guarantees a long-term view: sustainability, independence and employees' personal development.
The primary objective of the non-financial risks management policy is to protect the group's strategic assets. The broad strategic guidelines governing capital expenditure on industrial tools, the development of our processes, and the

recruitment and training of our workforce, all take continuous account of this objective of safeguarding our industrial, financial and human resources.
The aim of this approach is to limit industrial or other risks such as those mentioned above to which the group is naturally exposed.
The group's insurance strategy is based on two main principles:
Risks assessment
The Insurance Department of the group Finance Department is responsible for identifying and assessing all risks, in close cooperation with the operating entities and draws up a revised risk map on an annual basis. The scope and amounts of insurance coverage are set at group level, based on objectives defined by Bonduelle's Executive Management. The insurance programs are negotiated by the group's Insurance Department and placed with top tier insurance companies.
Transfer of risks
Global comprehensive programs have been set in place to transfer major risks with potentially significant strategic and financial impacts to the insurance market:
-- in light of the geographical dispersion and the size of our production facilities and deductible levels, all direct property damage risk has been transferred;
-- for other risks, policies have been put in place to the extent permitted by the insurance and reinsurance markets.
Other insurance programs covering less significant risks have also been taken out.

The main programs are summarized in the table below: (at July 1, 2019).

4.4 Internal control and risk management procedures ­ GRI 102-11

The Bonduelle Group has adopted the Reference Guidelines for internal control published by the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in January 2007 and updated in July 2010.

These risk management and internal control procedures cannot provide an absolute guarantee as to the achievement of the Company's objectives.

The Company oversees and implements a set of self-defined internal control and risk management measures consisting of various means, behaviors, procedures and initiatives suited to the characteristics of each fully consolidated company, as well as a number of companies accounted for using the equity method which:

In fact, any internal control system is subject to inherent limits, such as uncertainties regarding external conditions, the use of good judgment and the cost/benefit analysis of implementing new controls, or dysfunctions that can occur due to technical faults, human or simple errors.

the General Management;

Bonduelle SA manages the following tasks:

-- the smooth operation of the Company's internal procedures, especially as regards the protection of its assets;
-- the reliability of financial information.
The specific goal of the risk management plan is to:
-- create and preserve the value, assets and reputation of the Company by identifying and analyzing the main potential threats to the Company;
-- identify the main events and situations likely to affect in a significant way the Company's objectives;
-- ensure actions concur with the Company's values;
-- inform and mobilize the Company's employees around a common understanding of the main risks.
The internal control and risk management procedures apply to all entities falling within the scope of consolidation. As regards acquisitions, an internal control audit is performed within three months of the purchase. A compliance audit is performed in the year following the acquisition in order to ensure that the group's rules and procedures are correctly applied.

-- development policy, oversight of equity interests, mergers, acquisition and asset sales;
-- oversight of the group's overall financial policy, including financing means;
-- tax policy and implementation;
-- determination of compensation policies, oversight of management, and training and staff development;
-- protection of intellectual and industrial property rights;
-- compliance with all laws and regulations governing the group's operations;
-- management of the group's insurance programs;
-- approval of new advertising campaigns prior to their release;
-- corporate communication;
-- financial communication and investor, analyst and Shareholder relations;
-- pooling of resources, such as IT;
-- research and development programs.

The business units are organized by region and business activity, and divided into Europe and Non-Europe Zones.

4 REPORT OF THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT
Internal control and risk management procedures

They have their own financial resources, oversee their own product development, and are responsible for most of their production and all of their marketing needs.
The group's objectives are defined by the General Management. They not only involve business performance, but also areas in which the group is striving to achieve excellence, such as human resources management, quality, innovation, working conditions, and environmental protection.
The goals factor in past performance, in-depth analysis and ongoing changes in the business environment.
The risk analysis related to business activities is an integral part of the process of preparing action plans, which involves identifying the key success factors and analyzing the main assumptions used to achieve these objectives.
4.4.2 Contributors to the internal control risk management
The main risk management and internal control bodies are as follows:
At group level
Since July 1, 2018, Executive Management of Bonduelle SA has been exercised exclusively by its Chief Executive Officer, whose authority is attributed by law and the Company's Articles of association.
The Corporate Departments are responsible for enforcing decisions made by the Executive Management and must in particular ensure that the information presented to the latter is accurate and relevant.
Executive Management comprises a Chief Executive Officer and three Deputy CEOs, together forming the Chief Executive Board, the Chief Executive Officers of the various business units, the Head of the Bonduelle Prospective & Development division, the Head of External Communication and CSR and the Head of Human Resources, constituting the Group Management Committee. This reviewed the group's sales and financial performance and discusses all matters of interest to the group and its business units. It met six times during the fiscal year. The organization and responsibilities are described in greater detail in the corporate governance report.
The group's Internal Audit Department reports directly to the group's Executive Management and may be consulted by the Chairman. The audit programs and tasks are approved by the Executive Management and the Audit Committee. A report on each audit is sent to the group's governance bodies, the Operations Managers of the audited entities and the Statutory Auditors. Seventeen audits were performed during the 20182019 fiscal year in the group's various business units and

departments, thus enabling all the group's business activities to be covered over a three-year cycle. Following each audit, action plans are developed by the relevant operating units to correct deficiencies identified in the audit report, and the implementation of these action plans is monitored by the Internal Audit Department and Operations Managers, and then reviewed by the group's governance bodies.
The Supervisory Board, acting on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, is responsible for selecting the Statutory Auditors to be appointed or reappointed by the Shareholders' Meeting. The group is audited by a college of Statutory Auditor enabling geographic and global coverage of the group's risks.
At business unit level
The Management Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer and executive officers of the main functions. The Chief Financial Officer is specifically charged with implementing internal control systems to prevent and manage risks arising from the business units activities as well as those caused by errors or fraud.
Once a quarter, the group's Chief Executive Board meets as an Internal Board of Directors together with the Management Committee of each business unit to determine the business unit's objectives, review its performance and financial outlook and set its policies at business unit level. Specifically, the following topics are covered:
-- in February: interim results;
-- in June: budget and investments for the next year;
-- in September: annual results;
-- in November: medium-term plan.
Internal control procedures
Internal control procedures are included in the Finance and Administrative Handbook, which defines:
-- the respective areas of responsibility and authority of the Corporate Departments and the business units;
-- the applicable financial rules and processes.
This handbook is available in French and English and is updated at least once a year and in line with changes in the group's rules and procedures.
A formal procedure for delegating authority sets out the responsibilities of Executive Management, the management of the Corporate Departments and the Management Committees of the respective business units.
Budgetary control is based on three principles:
-- the budget is prepared on the basis of guidelines and directives established by the Executive Management;

The group has, moreover, developed an internal control selfassessment process based on a questionnaire intended to measure the extent to which the rules and procedures are properly applied within fully consolidated group entities. This questionnaire is completed yearly. It is shared with Executive Management, the group Finance Department, the Chief Executive Officers of the group's business units and the Audit Committee.

A report is made to the Supervisory Board of the roll-out of these procedures and action plans associated with the different risks identified.
4.4.4 Internal control procedures applicable to the preparation of financial and accounting information

5 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

In terms of work carried out to date, the lease liability is estimated at between 80 and 100 million euros at the commencement of the 2019-2020 fiscal year.
The main leases by value are leases on plants, registered offices and agricultural land in Europe and the United States. Other leases are for vehicles and industrial and agricultural equipment.
1.1.1. Information concerning the group
Listed on Euronext (Compartment A), Bonduelle SCA is a French limited partnership (société en commandite par actions). Bonduelle, a leading player in plant-based food, is in particular a market leader in processed vegetables both within and outside Europe. The Company operates in three business segments: canned, frozen and ready-to-use fresh vegetables (ready-to-eat prepared and fresh-cut ready-touse vegetables).
General Management approved the consolidated financial statements under IFRS and authorized the publication of the approved financial statements closed on June 30, 2019, which will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2019.
Acquisition of a frozen food plant in Russia On June 3, 2019, the Bonduelle Group announced that it had acquired the industrial assets of the frozen vegetable producer, LLC SHOCK, in the region of Belgorod (Russia).
Located in an agricultural region that is renowned for its temperate climate and particularly fertile soil (blackcentral soil), this industrial site will accelerate the expansion of Bonduelle's frozen vegetable business in these same markets, through high-quality production.
This production site, with an initial acquisition cost of around 7 million euros and a limited investment requirement, will make it possible to process between 6,000 and 10,000 tonnes of frozen vegetables a year. About 50 permanent employees will work at the site and in partnership with the local agricultural community, developing its know-how in terms of environmentally-friendly agricultural practices.
Bonduelle successfully issued a new private bond on the US market (USPP) Looking for additional maturity for its financing and for the refinancing of the EuroPP maturing on March 11, 2019, on May 2, 2019, Bonduelle issued a new 140 million euro private placement in the United States (USPP) with a ten-year maturity. This took the average maturity of the group's overall debt to over four years.
Operating on the USPP market since 2000, Bonduelle issued this private placement under particularly attractive terms to a pool of existing investors who confirmed their confidence in the group. Largely oversubscribed, this transaction enabled the group to significantly reduce the cost of its debt.

Bonduelle was advised by Natixis, acting as agent, and by Willkie Farr & Gallagher, acting as legal adviser.
Bonduelle continues to expand its frozen food business in the United States with the acquisition of the Lebanon plant On February 12, 2019, the Bonduelle Group announced that it had reached a definitive agreement with the US company Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ: SENEA, SENEB) to acquire its Lebanon plant (Pennsylvania, USA).
This plant, which is used for packaging frozen products, was built in 2008 and acquired by Seneca in 2010. It has a capacity of 45,000 tonnes on seven packaging lines which are all in perfect working order. It has a large storage capacity and has 140 permanent employees.
The Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) business unit which, until recently, had a limited capacity for expansion, has thus increased its frozen food production facilities in North America, now with four industrial units on the East coast of the United States and six in Canada. As well as the additional packaging capacity generating revenue, this acquisition will allow both industrial and logistical synergies with existing facilities and will improve the quality of the service offered to BALL business unit customers.
This acquisition, including industrial assets, inventories of frozen products and Lebanon industrial site personnel, effective February 11, 2019, will, given the seasonality of the business, be accretive from the 2019-2020 fiscal year.
1.1.2. Consolidation methods
The consolidated financial statements fully consolidate the financial statements of all subsidiaries controlled either directly or indirectly by the group.
Control is defined and measured in accordance with IFRS 10, based on three criteria: power of decision, exposure to variable returns and the relationship between power and those returns.
Full consolidation allows recognition of all of assets, liabilities and income statement items of the companies concerned, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and earnings, with the portion of income and equity attributable to group companies ("group share") distinguished from the portion concerning the interests of other Shareholders ("Noncontrolling interests"). All companies over which Bonduelle does not exercise exclusive control yet still exerts significant influence or joint control are accounted for using the equity method.
Soléal is fully consolidated, as the company is controlled by the group and, from a contractual and financial standpoint, Soléal's sole intra-group customer is Bonduelle Europe Long Life SAS (BELL).

The two operating segments are: Europe Zone and NonEurope Zone.
The Europe Zone covers the following geographical areas: France, Germany, Italy and the Iberian Peninsula which form Southern Europe, Northern Europe and Central Europe.
The Non-Europe Zone covers Eastern Europe, Asia, the Mercosur, North America and Export markets.
The primary indicators published are those used by the group's Executive Management. Revenue, operating profit and non-current assets are presented by geographical region. Revenue is also presented by operating segment.

1.1.5. Business combinations
All business combinations have been recognized using the acquisition method since July 1, 2009 in accordance with standard IFRS 3 (revised) (Business Combinations), and according to IFRS 3 for acquisitions made before this date.
According to this method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value, notwithstanding the exceptions specified in IFRS 3R.
For all combinations formed after July 1, 2009, the extra costs associated with the acquisition are recognized in expenses.
Similarly, from July 1, 2009, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (minority interest) can either be measured at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (IFRS 3 2004), or at its fair value (referred to as the full goodwill method). This option is available on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

The difference between the cost of acquisition of the shares and the fair value of the acquired share of identifiable assets and liabilities on the acquisition date is recognized in goodwill.

5 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

If the cost of an acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the negative goodwill (badwill) is recognized directly in profit and loss.
The goodwill analysis is finalized during the assessment period, i.e. 12 months from the takeover date.
Note 1.2 Accounting principles
The consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2019 are presented in thousands of euros, and reflect the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as "the group").
They have been prepared on the basis of historical costs, with the exception of the assets and liabilities discussed below, which are recognized at fair value.
1.2.1. Intangible assets
Goodwill When shares are acquired in companies that are either fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method, the cost of acquiring the shares is allocated to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired measured at their fair value. Any positive difference between the acquisition cost and the group's share in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired represents goodwill. These differences are presented on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet under "Goodwill" for fully-consolidated companies and under "Investments in associates" for companies accounted for using the equity method.
Goodwill relating to foreign companies is recognized in the functional currency of the Company acquired.
Negative goodwill (badwill) is immediately recognized in the income statement as non-recurring items.
Other intangible assets All separately identifiable brands acquired whose useful life is considered to be indefinite are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under the heading "Other intangible assets".
Licenses, patents and any other intangible assets acquired are recognized at their acquisition cost under "Other intangible assets" in the consolidated balance sheet. They are amortized on a straight-line basis in accordance with their projected useful life.
All development costs must be capitalized as intangible assets when the Company can prove that they will generate future economic benefits and their costs can be identified.
Development costs for software used within the group are carried as assets in the balance sheet when it is probable that these expenses will generate future economic benefits. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the software, which may be between one and five years. All other software acquisition and development costs are immediately recognized as expenses.

Monitoring of brand values The main factors used to assess the indefinite nature of the useful life of the brands were their market positioning in terms of sales volume, brand awareness, and their expected long-term profitability.
These values are not amortized but undergo an annual impairment test, in accordance with IAS 36, which includes the monitoring of the indicators cited above.
Monitoring of goodwill values The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year; all other intangible assets are tested when other events and conditions suggest that they are likely to have experienced a loss of value. An impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount of the intangible assets becomes less than their net carrying amount.
Any impairment is allocated first to the goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Unit (CGU), and then as a reduction of the net carrying amount of each asset within the CGU.
The recoverable amount of goodwill, which is used to calculate any impairment to be recognized in the financial statements, is the value-in-use estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows. If this value-in-use does not cover the assets' carrying amount, the recoverable amount used (if higher) is their fair value less selling costs.
Cash Generating Units are combinations of subsidiaries that belong to the same business segment and that generate cash flows that are clearly distinct from those generated by other CGUs. The cash flows used to calculate values in use are taken from the CGUs' five-year strategic plans.
A 1% growth rate is used to extrapolate the predicted cash flows beyond the five-year period included in the strategic plans.
These cash flows are discounted on the basis of a weighted average cost of capital (WACC = 6.3%) calculated using the market data available for Bonduelle and its business segments.
The WACC is calculated based on a market-based debt of 24% of long-term equity and a risk-free rate of 1.5%.
The group uses the following operating segments to monitor its CGUs for each operating segment: Europe Zone and NonEurope Zone.
For the Europe Zone:
-- canned and frozen vegetables segment;
-- ready-to-use fresh vegetables segment.
For the Non-Europe Zone:
-- canned and frozen vegetables segment in North and South America;

5 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

Other non-current financial assets Other non-current financial assets primarily comprise security deposits required under certain countries' tax regulations and funds covering post-employment benefit schemes. The assets are recognized at amortized cost.
1.2.4. Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include:
-- bonds;
-- accrued interest not yet due;
-- outstandings on finance leases;
-- borrowings and bank lines;
-- derivative liabilities.
Financial liabilities are measured and recognized at their amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. They are recognized at the settlement date.
In accordance with IFRS 9, which amended IAS 39 on accounting policies for fair value hedging, bonds, which were swapped at the time they were issued, were marked to market. Changes in the fair value of the debt and the associated derivatives are recognized through profit or loss for the period.
1.2.5. Derivative instruments
The group uses over-the-counter derivatives to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Group policy excludes being engaged in speculative transactions on the financial markets.
Derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value:
-- derivatives used to manage net debt and to hedge net investment in foreign operations are recognized as Derivative assets or liabilities;
-- operational currency derivatives are recognized under Derivative assets or liabilities:
· if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge
for assets or liabilities recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, changes in value of both the derivative and the underlying hedged item are recognized through profit or loss for the same period,
· if the derivative is designated as a hedge of a net
investment in foreign operations, changes in value are recognized in equity under translation adjustments and are recycled to profit or loss when the asset is derecognized,
· if the derivative is designated as a future cash flow hedge:
­ changes in the value of its effective portion are recognized in equity under other comprehensive income and are recycled to profit or loss when the hedged item is itself recognized in profit or loss under the same heading,

­ the time value (swap and currency option premium, cross-currency basis swap spreads) is recognized in equity under other comprehensive income and is recognized in profit or loss when the underlying matures, in line with the principles adopted by the group.
Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of instruments qualifying as hedges, and changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for the use of hedge accounting, are recognized directly through profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives are recognized at the transaction date.
IFRS 7.27A distinguishes three levels of methods for determining fair value:
-- level 1: quoted prices on an active market for similar instruments with no adjustment;
-- level 2: fair value determined based on data observable either directly (such as a price) or indirectly (calculated based on another price), but other than a quoted price on an active market as stated under level 1;
-- level 3: fair value determined based on unobservable market data.
The method used by Bonduelle is level 2 in accordance with IFRS 13. Moreover, the market data used in the valuation models includes central bank fixings and data supplied by platforms such as Reuters.
1.2.6. Inventories
Materials inventories are measured at their weighted average unit cost. Inventories of work in progress and finished goods are measured at their production cost, which includes the cost of purchasing the materials used and all direct and indirect production costs (including fixed production costs).
Borrowing costs are not included in the inventory cost. Impairment is deemed necessary in the following cases:
-- for raw materials, when the current market price is lower than the inventory value;
-- for finished goods and commodities sold as-is, each time the probable net realizable value is lower than the production or purchase cost.
The amount of impairment required to bring inventory to its net realizable value, and all inventory losses, are recognized as expenses for the period during which the impairment or loss occurred. The sum of any recoveries of inventory impairment resulting from an increase in the net realizable value is recognized as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognized in expenses in the period during which the recovery was made.
Intercompany margins are eliminated.

5 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

In accordance with IAS 19, "Employee Benefits", the projected unit credit method is used to calculate pension and other post-retirement benefits under the defined benefit plans, in particular using assumptions about salary inflation, employee turnover, retirement age and life expectancy.
The corresponding actuarial liabilities are recognized either as contributions paid to insurance companies or in the form of provisions.
Under the revised IAS 19, the Bonduelle Group recognizes the actuarial gains and losses generated during the year directly to equity.
Actuarial gains and losses are generated by inter-period changes in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate the value of the liabilities and the assets, and by experience differences corresponding to changes to the database of individual records.
The lines "Impact of discounting" and "Projected return on plan assets" are recognized through net financial expense.
Under defined contribution plans, the group's only obligation is to pay the required premiums. Said premiums are recognized in the income statement for the period.
1.2.12. Other non-current and current provisions
Provisions are established for clearly identifiable risks and expenses whose timing or amount is uncertain, when an obligation to a third party actually exists and it is certain or probable that this obligation will result in an outflow of resources without receiving at least equivalent consideration.
In the case of restructuring, an obligation is recognized once its implementation has begun or a detailed plan has been drawn up that has, to a sufficiently clear extent, created a well-founded expectation on the part of the persons in question that the Company will implement the restructuring.
With regard to US companies with workers' compensation programs, compensation claims made and not yet settled on the reporting date, whether carried forward or not, are covered by provisions determined on the basis of the estimated cost of settlement and related processing costs. Where there is enough historical group or market data on claims made and settled, the Executive Management of such companies, with the help of external actuaries, estimates the risks covered by such companies for claims not yet reported, using the actuarial cost method for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR ­ Incurred But Not Reported). Such provisions are recognized as provisions for employee-related risks and expenses in the Bonduelle Group financial statements and are remeasured every year.

1.2.13. Revenue
Revenue is derived mainly from sales of finished products. It is recognized in profit or loss when the customer actually obtains control of the product, when it can direct the use and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from it.
Revenue is recognized net of any discounts or rebates accorded to customers and any costs related to trade agreements, referencing agreements, and/or concerning occasional promotional campaigns invoiced by distributors as well as any penalties that may be incurred by Bonduelle. These amounts are measured when the revenue is recognized, on the basis of agreements and commitments with the customers in question.
Revenue may also include transport services supplied by Bonduelle to its customers. Revenue is then recognized when the service is provided.
1.2.14. Other current operating income and expenses
This item primarily comprises grants, income from asset disposals, sales not classed as revenue (particularly sales to partners) as well as income associated with adjustments or compensation received.
1.2.15. Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items comprise significant items that cannot be considered as inherent to the group's operational activity due to their nature and non-habitual character. They include mainly badwill, impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill) from consolidated shareholdings, restructuring and reorganization costs, acquisition costs, insurance deductibles and costs related to uncovered claims, and financial losses arising from fraud or fines, as well as the impacts of changes in estimates.
1.2.16. Share-based payments
Share purchase options and free shares granted to employees are measured at their fair value on the allocation date. The fair value is calculated using the Black & Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the discounting of share value adjusted for dividends for the free share allocation plans. The fair value of free shares granted is also calculated on the basis of presence and performance requirements established by the Executive Management. This value is recognized in the income statement for the period during which employee's exercise rights become vested, with the offsetting entry consisting of an equivalent increase in Shareholders' equity. All expenses recognized in relation to options that expire prior to becoming exercisable are reversed in the income statement for the period during which they expire.

Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

-- current operating income: current operating income corresponds to net income before financial expense, income tax and share of net income from associates. The group uses current operating profit as its main performance indicator. Current operating profit shall be taken before taking into account non-recurring items. These correspond to material

items that are unusual, abnormal and infrequent and do not relate to the Company's underlying performance;
-- ROCCE: this ratio measures the profitability of capital investments made by Shareholders and funds loaned by banks and other financial partners. It is obtained by dividing current operating profit by capital employed, or the sum of Shareholders' equity and net debt.

2. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION
Note 2.1 Changes in the scope of consolidation and acquisitions of individual assets
Acquisition of Del Monte's processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada
On July 3, 2018, the Bonduelle Group acquired Del Monte's processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada from Conagra Brands Inc.
This acquisition includes the right to use the Del Monte brand on different processed fruit and vegetables segments for an indeterminate period, as well as related inventories of products. The acquired business does not include any industrial assets as co-packers and Bonduelle's existing production capabilities will be used.
This acquisition was recognized under IFRS 3. The fair values acquired break down as follows: 10,323 thousand euros for the Del Monte brand, 6,044 thousand euros for inventories. This resulted in a cash outflow of 28,142 thousand euros, thereby generating goodwill of 11,775 thousand euros over the period.
Acquisition of the Lebanon plant (USA)
On February 12, 2019, the Bonduelle Group reached a definitive agreement with the US company Seneca (NASDAQ: SENEA, SENEB) to acquire its Lebanon plant (Pennsylvania, USA).

This plant, which is used for packaging frozen products, was built in 2008 and acquired by Seneca in 2010. It has a capacity of 45,000 tonnes on seven packaging lines, which are all in perfect working order, and has a large storage capacity.
On the acquisition date, this transaction generated the recognition of property plant and equipment amounting to 9,991 thousand euros and inventories amounting to 7,305 thousand euros.
Acquisition of the Belgorod plant (Russia)
On June 3, 2019, the Bonduelle Group, through its newly created subsidiary, Bonduelle Belgorod LLC, acquired frozen vegetable production assets in Belgorod (Russia).
Located in an agricultural region that is renowned for its temperate climate and particularly fertile soil (blackcentral soil), this industrial site will accelerate the expansion of Bonduelle's frozen vegetable business in these same markets, through high-quality production.
This asset acquisition resulted in the recognition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 6,638 thousand euros on the acquisition date.

The assets managed by financial institutions to cover the group's termination benefit obligations are matched to general assets.

At June 30, 2019, the sensitivity of provisions for retirement benefits to the discount rate was as follows: a 0.50 point rise in the discount rate would have reduced the group's liability by 1,737 thousand euros. Conversely, a 0.50 point drop would have increased the group's liability by 1,919 thousand euros.

Valuation of stock option and free share allocation plans
As stated in Note 1.2, Section 16, share purchase options and free shares granted to employees are measured at their fair value on the allocation date, based on the Black & Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the discounting of

share value adjusted for dividends for the free share allocation plans. The fair value of free shares granted is also calculated on the basis of presence and performance requirements established by the Executive Management.
The charge under IFRS 2 for the period was 1,496 thousand euros.

5. FINANCING AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Note 5.1 Management of financial risks
The group has established an organization that provides for centralized management of all of its liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty credit risks. The Finance Department has assigned the group Finance and Treasury Department responsibility for risk management, and provided it with all of the expertise and tools needed to participate in the various financial markets as effectively and safely as possible. The organization and procedures utilized are regularly reviewed by the Internal Audit Department and the Statutory Auditors. At meetings held regularly with the Chief Financial Officer and Finance and Treasury Direction, the group's Executive Management validates, on the basis of a report published monthly, the implementation of previously authorized management strategies.
In a rapidly changing global economic environment, characterized by market volatility and changes in financial techniques, the role of the group Finance and Treasury Department is to:
-- ensure optimum and sufficient funding to finance the development and growth of the group's operating activities;
-- identify, evaluate and hedge all financial risks in close collaboration with the operations teams.
The objective is to minimize, at the lowest possible cost, the impact of financial market fluctuations on the group's income statement, in order to reduce the capital allocation required to manage these financial risks.
The group prohibits the taking of speculative positions.
5.1.1. Liquidity risk
The group Finance Department is responsible for maintaining sufficient liquidity at all times. It accomplishes this by efficiently managing the group's cash balances and ensuring that the maturity and conditions of the financing obtained are appropriate. In particular, it arranges confirmed lines of credit to maximize the flexibility of the group's financing (see Note 5.6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2019).

The Company specifically reviewed its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future payments.
5.1.2. Market risks
Currency risk
Risks related to changes in foreign exchange rates The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in euros, and in 2018-2019, 45.4% of revenue and 40.3% of current operating income were denominated in euros.
The share of assets, liabilities, sales and earnings denominated in other currencies ­ essentially the Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Russian ruble, Brazilian real and US and Canadian dollars ­ fluctuates continuously. This means that the group is affected by fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the euro when they are translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements. For example, when the euro appreciates against these currencies it reduces the earnings contribution from those subsidiaries whose financial statements are denominated in these currencies.
All sales and expenses of group subsidiaries are generally expressed in their local currency, with the exception of imports, exports and financial transactions covered by centralized and systematic foreign currency hedges, where the type of exposure means that it can be hedged: Bonduelle therefore believes that its local exposure to currency fluctuations, after hedging, is limited.
The group's international growth strategy contributes to increasing the weight of non euro-denominated activities in revenue, operating profit and consolidated net income.
Hedging policies for currency risk The group seeks to hedge all risks relating to the activities of its subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than their functional currency and risks relating to the financing of some subsidiaries operating in countries whose functional currency is not the euro; the asset/liability structure of the financing is created by natural matching or by putting financial instruments in place.

to hedge the financial risks generated by its production and sales activities. All hedges entered into must comply with the objectives and procedures established by the Bonduelle Group's Executive Management. These transactions are centralized within the group Finance and Treasury Department.
The group's policy regarding fluctuations in foreign exchange rates consists of periodically calculating its net exposure to foreign currencies and using financial derivatives to reduce this risk.

In its dealings in financial assets in general and any cash balances, the group works only with highly-rated bank counterparties. Any cash surpluses are generally managed in short-term interest-bearing deposits.
Raw materials risk The Bonduelle Group has always favored the best agricultural lands and the geographical diversification of its sourcing regions when deciding where to locate its production facilities, in order to reduce the climate-related risks inherent to all growing activities.

The group makes use above all of forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options entered into with highly-rated bank counterparties. Details of the portfolio as well as an analysis of foreign exchange rate sensitivity appear in Notes 5.2 and 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2019.

There is, moreover, no organized market for the agricultural raw materials purchased by the Bonduelle Group. Changes in the prices of agricultural raw materials quoted on a market do, however, have a more or less significant impact on the group's purchase prices, depending on the agricultural alternatives available to producers. In order to ensure long-

The cost of net debt, the main component of the financial result, stood at -21.9 million euros at June 30, 2019 compared with -22.7 million euros the previous year.
It mainly comprises 22 million euros in interest paid at the effective interest rate. Further to the adoption of IFRS 9, the impact of residual ineffectiveness on the debt hedged at fair value, and hedge derivatives recognized at fair value linked to cross-currency basis swap spreads, is recognized in equity and will be recognized in profit or loss when the underlying debt matures, in line with the option offered by IFRS 9 and adopted by the group.
The reduction in the cost of net debt was mainly due to:
-- the impact of interest rates related to a change in the breakdown of group debt by currency;
-- reimbursement of the EuroPP issued in 2012;
-- amortization of the first tranche of the USPP issued in 2010.
The interest rate, calculated on the group's average debt, in all currencies, and restated to account for IFRS impacts, stood at 2.41%, compared with 2.65% the previous year.

Other financial income and expenses (-0.7 million euros) breaks down as follows:
-- -0.4 million foreign exchange result corresponding to gain/ losses from foreign exchange hedges on flows relating to commercial activities and treasury flows in foreign exchange currencies. Further to the adoption of IFRS 9, the impact of ineffectiveness (time value of options) is recognized in equity and reclassified to profit or loss when the underlying flow matures, in line with the principles adopted by the group;
-- -0.4 million euros in other financial income and expenses.
As required by IFRS 7, the group performed sensitivity analyses to measure its exposure to material changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The scope of the interest rate sensitivity analyses included all financial instruments, both debt and derivatives. The analyses were made assuming a uniform shift of +/-50 basis points in all yield curve maturities at the reporting date. The market values of the instruments were obtained from the valuation platforms used by the group's Finance and Treasury Department, and market data are populated using real-time information systems (Reuters, etc.).

The same valuation methods used to measure interest rate sensitivity (information systems and valuation platforms, etc.) are used to measure the group's exposure to changes in the currencies it uses for business and financing purposes (USD, HUF, CAD, RUB, PLN, etc.). The scope includes all balance sheet liabilities and receivables, those portions of traderelated flows expected to be generated during the period hedged, and all derivative instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures.

In accordance with IFRS 7 §23, it is specified that, since this consists primarily of hedges of trading flows denominated in foreign currencies, the flows hedged and the associated hedging instruments generally mature in less than one year.
In the case of longer-term assets or liabilities, hedges can extend beyond one year, though they must not exceed the current limit of five years.
For the methods used to prepare the currency fluctuation sensitivity calculations, a variation of +/-5% in exposure to the main currencies has been applied.

5 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (IFRS 7 amendment) The group subscribes for over-the-counter derivatives with leading banks under agreements which offset payables and receivables in the event of default of one of the contracting parties. These conditional netting agreements do not meet IAS 32 criteria for offsetting derivative assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. They do, however, fall within the scope of disclosures to be made under IFRS 7.13 on the offsetting of financial assets and liabilities. On this basis, the effects of the netting agreements are as follows:
-- net amount of derivative assets under IFRS 7.13: +17.8 million euros;
-- net amount of derivative liabilities under IFRS 7.13: -1.3 million euros.

The fair value of 16.4 million euros recognized in the balance sheet for derivative assets essentially relates to crosscurrency swaps in US dollars. These swaps were introduced to hedge the bond issue in the United States with a nominal value of 116 million US dollars at June 30, 2019.
These transactions are equally distributed among three highly rated bank counterparties.

(1) The valuation principles are set out in Note 1.2. (2) This is the carrying amount of the main holdings of non-consolidated companies by the group. The heading primarily contains the
Bonduelle Group's minority interests in Coopérative France Champignon (France), whose net income for the period was not deemed significant. In accordance with IFRS 10 and 11, this company was not consolidated (Note 1.1.2), since the group does not have a controlling interest. The change in the fair value of these securities is recognized in Shareholders' equity. (3) Reclassifications and fair value of derivative assets.

Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements

Note 5.5 Derivative financial instruments
The group uses over-the-counter derivatives to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Group policy excludes being engaged in speculative transactions on the financial markets.
5.5.1. Interest rate derivatives
Fair value hedges Two of the fixed-rate bonds issued by the group were swapped to a variable interest rate at the time they were issued. The EUR tranche of the USPP issued on July 6, 2017, was swapped, in full, to a variable interest rate. These swaps meet the criteria required for fair value hedge accounting under IAS 39, amended by IFRS 9. The portion of the underlying debt and the swaps were recognized in the balance sheet at their market value.
Cash flow hedges In August 2010, the group issued a fixed-rate USPP bond of 145 million dollars. In respect of the share of debt hedged by a derivative instrument converting a USD fixed-rate into a euro fixed-rate, provided the effectiveness of the hedging relationship has been validated using prospective tests, all changes in fair value of these instruments are booked directly to equity.
With regard to the EUR tranche of the USPP issued in July 2017, caps were put in place to protect against any interest rate rises. These hedges meet the criteria required for accounting in equity under IFRS 9.
Hedges not eligible for hedge accounting under IFRS The group's debt also includes outstanding debts swapped into a variable interest rate. The group is therefore exposed to increases in euro interest rates. To hedge this risk, the group has set in place tunnel-type options, or caps, that protect it against any significant rise in interest rates. These instruments now meet the criteria required for accounting in equity under IFRS 9. At June 30, 2019, the group did not have any interest rate hedges that were not eligible for hedge accounting.

5.5.2. Foreign currency derivatives
Fair value hedges The group is exposed to changes in the value of the bonds issued in US dollar in 2010 produced by fluctuations in the EUR/ USD exchange rate. Derivatives: forward currency contracts or cross-currency swaps, qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39, amended by IFRS 9, have been introduced to fully hedge the residual nominal value of this risk.
As in previous years, the group introduced foreign currency and interest rate hedges on intra-group financing covering the needs of some of its subsidiaries located outside of the euro zone (Canada, Russia, Brazil, Hungary, Poland and the US). This intra-group financing has been the subject of full and systematic hedging of the foreign exchange risk, so that changes in the underlying value (loan/intra-group borrowings in currencies) are fully offset by changes in inverse values of the hedging item. Typically, these hedges were made through buy or sales forward contracts.
Cash flow hedges Most of the group's sales are in euros. However, in certain countries, the group may issue invoices denominated in foreign currencies, mostly the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Hungarian forint, Russian ruble and Polish zloty. The group publishes its financial statements in euros, and changes in the value of these currencies against the euro may impact consolidated net income. To limit the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in exchange rates, the group introduces cash flow hedges using foreign currency forwards and options.
Cross-currency swaps also encompass an interest rate component in the hedging. When it involves hedging changes in the value of future cash flows by freezing them using a fixed rate, this hedging is eligible for cash flow hedge treatment; changes in value are then recorded in equity, then recycled in profit and loss as and when hedged flows occur.
Hedges not eligible for hedge accounting under IFRS Some derivatives introduced by the group to hedge future cash flows do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. These consist mainly of out-of-the-money options. Under these circumstances, changes in value are recognized directly in profit or loss.

At June 30, 2019
Issuances are subject to financial covenants, principally an early redemption clause should Bonduelle default on its financial debt (cross default), and in the event of failure to comply with the following ratios:
-- long-term debt/long-term equity ratio less than or equal to 0.60;
-- consolidated current assets/consolidated current liabilities greater than or equal to 1.10.
At June 30, 2019, the group complied with these financial covenants.
5.6.7. Liquidity
At June 30, 2019, 45 million euros were drawn from the 300 million euro RCF (Revolving Credit Facility) maturing in 2021.

On this same date, the group had several confirmed bank credit lines with maturities of up to three years, bringing the amount of confirmed bank lines (including RCF) to 380 million euros, and which were unused at June 30, 2019 (unchanged since June 2018).
The sums drawn from bank loans (including RCF) confirmed beyond a year are reported in the consolidated balance sheet under non-current financial liabilities.
Looking for maturity of its debt instrument and for the refinancing of the EuroPP maturing, on May 2, 2019, Bonduelle successfully issued on May 2, 2019 a new 140 million euro private placement on the US market (USPP) with a 10-year maturity. Operating on the USPP market since 2000, Bonduelle issued this private placement under particularly attractive terms among pool of existing investors who confirmed their confidence in the group.

Cash Generating Units (CGUs) presenting indications of impairment or comprising goodwill underwent impairment testing in 2019.
Depending on the CGU in question and the relevance of the assumptions and the availability of comparable benchmarks on the market, the recoverable amount of the assets used by the group is either a value in use or a market value.
The main assumptions used to determine values in use for each CGU are described in Note 1.2.1.
The 2019 impairment tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.

The group analyzed the sensitivity of the value obtained to three parameters that are key to the measurement approach taken:
-- cash flow discount rate;
-- long-term growth rate;
-- operating margin rate.
CGUs deemed to be sensitive to one of these three variables are those for which a hike of more than 1 point in the discount rate, or a drop of more than 0.5 points in the long-term growth rate, or a drop of more than 1 point in the operating margin, would result in depreciation.
Any change of these proportions in the discount rate, the long-term growth rate or the operating margin would not result in depreciation of the CGU.

At June 30, 2019, the net amount per CGU was as follows:

financial penalties exemption for the group.

The amount of provisions made is based on Bonduelle's assessment of the level of risk on a case-by-case basis, and depends on its assessment of the basis for the claims, the stage of the proceedings and/or disputes and the arguments in its defense, it being specified that the occurrence of events during proceedings may lead to a reappraisal of the risk at any moment.
On September 27, 2019, the European Commission adopted its decision on sanctions against various players of certain market segments of canned vegetables in Europe.

As a reminder, in 2013, Bonduelle adopted, in all its business segments, an antitrust training program onboarding its employees, completed by a whistleblowing system. These principles, assembled in a Charter of Ethics, are a day-today guide for all the teams and a benchmark for the Ethics Committee.
At June 30, 2019, there were no new disputes to report, other than those relating to ordinary business.

Greenhouse gases: in the absence of a defined IFRS accounting policy, greenhouse gas quotas are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Bonduelle Group's certified and reported emissions stood at 18,255 tCO2e for 2018.

As a result of energy savings at its sites since 2008, for example, the use of biomass steam in 2015 at the Estrées-Mons (France) site halved the group's greenhouse gas emissions subject to the Emission Trading System (ETS). Bonduelle has surplus allowances available in its account and so did not have to make purchases on the carbon allowance market.
No significant provisions for guarantees or environmental risks had been recognized at June 30, 2019.

Post-employment benefits
In application of the Decree of January 9, 2012, the group has established a supplementary, defined contribution pension plan (so-called Article 83 plan), which is paid for to a significant extent by the beneficiaries concerned, with the group paying the remainder.

Employment contract termination benefit
These benefits comprise termination benefits and long service awards available to all employees in respect of the collective agreements linked to their employment contracts. For the 2018-2019 fiscal year, these totaled 1,005 thousand euros for GMC members.

This plan is for all Managers who are members of the AGIRC

scheme, with gross annual compensation of more than four times the annual French social security ceiling.
The reference compensation set by the plan in question and used to calculate beneficiaries' rights is the basic and variable annual compensation. This reference compensation does not include any sum that cannot be classed as salary within the meaning of Article L. 242-1 of the French Social Security Code, but which may be classed as such at a later date.
Entitlements are acquired on a monthly basis. The contributions used to fund the defined contribution pension fund amount to 8% of the reference compensation, calculated within the limit of tranches A, B and C.
62.5% of these contributions are paid by the Company and 37.5% by the beneficiary.
Please note that for Guillaume Debrosse, the estimated lifetime annuity (for retirement at 62 years of age) evaluated on an annual basis on the reporting date, was 842 euros per year. This estimate is based on savings built up since the plan was set up.

In accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring your attention to the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as our responses to those risks.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific elements, accounts or items of the consolidated financial statements.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the General Management.
Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Objective of an audit and audit approach
Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified by article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), the scope of our statutory audit does not include assurance on the future viability of the Company or the quality with which Company's management has conducted or will conduct the affairs of the entity.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements

As part of an audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. We also:
-- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
-- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.
-- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.
-- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, we modify our opinion.
-- Evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
-- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities included in the consolidation scope to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular as description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We also bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most

significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit

matters. We describe these matters in the audit report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our

5

independence in the sense of the rules applicable in France as defined in particular by articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French

Commercial Code (code de commerce) and or in the French Code of ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss

with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the

related safeguards.

-- provide access to financial markets to raise the funds needed to develop the group's activities.

Bonduelle SCA is the consolidating company of the Bonduelle Group.
On March 11, 2019, Bonduelle SCA redeemed the 145 million euro European private placement (EuroPP) issued in September 2012.
The Company received a dividend of 30,055 thousand euros from its subsidiary, Bonduelle SA, in accordance with the decision of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2018.

Note 1 Accounting principles and policies

The annual financial statements for the period were prepared

The main rules and methods used are the following:

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France, as defined by the French General Accounting Plan,

1.1 Change in methods

6

and the latest regulations issued by the French accounting standards body (ANC).

No notable change in method was applied over the period.

The basic method used to value the items recognized in the financial statements is the historical cost method.
General accounting conventions were applied with due regard for the principle of prudence and in accordance with these basic assumptions:

1.2 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment were recognized at their purchase or contribution cost.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over expected useful life.

-- going concern;
-- consistency of accounting methods;
-- independence of fiscal years.
and in compliance with the general rules governing the preparation and presentation of annual financial statements (ANC Regulation 2018-01 of April 20, 2018, approved by an order dated October 8, 2018).

1.3 Non-current financial assets
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and other long-term investments are carried at cost.
A provision for impairment is recognized if the value in use is lower than the carrying amount. The value in use of such

BONDUELLE

UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018-2019

223

6 PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the annual parent company financial statements

investments in subsidiaries is determined on the basis of various items such as net assets, the existence of unrealized capital gains and earnings forecasts approved by the Executive Management.
Treasury shares ANC Regulation 2014-03 was applied. This standard concerns the accounting treatment for stock option and share subscription plans and the granting of free shares to employees.
Therefore, treasury shares acquired are now recorded on the basis of their intended use, either in non-current financial assets or in securities.
Treasury shares held under liquidity contracts or for use in acquisitions are classified under non-current financial assets.
Treasury shares allocated to the coverage of stock option plans are reclassified into securities at their net carrying amount on the date they are allocated by the General Management.
Treasury shares held under a liquidity contract and for use in acquisitions Treasury shares held under the terms of a liquidity contract or for use in making acquisitions are recognized at purchase price.
At the close of the fiscal year, impairment is recognized if the average market share price for the previous month is lower than the average price paid to purchase the shares held as treasury shares as well as those allocated to stock option plans which are not expected to be exercised.
1.4 Receivables
Receivables are recognized at their face value. A provision is set aside, if needed, to cover any risk of default.
1.5 Provisions for risks and expenses
Provisions are assessed by the Executive Management to take account of the Company's actual obligations (legal or implied), in compliance with French accounting policies and notably the provisions of ANC Regulation 2014-03 regarding liabilities. Any disputes are evaluated on the basis of the claims made by third parties, which are revised, if applicable, on the basis of the defensive actions taken by the Company.
1.6 Translation of foreign currency items
All receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate of the fiscal year. Any differences arising from changes in exchange rates are recognized in "translation adjustments" in the balance sheet.
1.7 Marketable securities
Treasury shares allocated to stock option plans Treasury shares are recorded:
-- at purchase price, if acquired to be allocated directly to the cover of stock option plans;

-- at net carrying amount on the date they are allocated by the General Management to cover stock option plans, if these shares had been acquired previously or were taken from treasury shares recorded in non-current financial assets.
The shares are allocated into separate sub-categories based on the likelihood of the stock options being exercised by beneficiaries, in light of the average market share price for the previous month.
Shares allocated to stock option plans that are likely to be exercised are the object of an expense accrued to liabilities if the exercise price is lower than the carrying amount. The probability of an option being exercised is evaluated on a plan-by-plan basis, in light of the conditions of each plan. The total value of this future expense is spread evenly over the vesting period. The corresponding expense is recorded under net operating profit in the Section "charge in provisions for risks and expenses".
This provision is offset by the recognition of an accrued income in the same amount under the group company accounts in respect of the workforce beneficiaries.
The costs incurred are invoiced according to the same rules. They are recorded under net operating profit in the Section "transfer of capitalized costs".
Treasury shares allocated to stock option plans that are unlikely to be exercised by employees are written down if, at the reporting date, the average market share price for the previous month is lower than the average price of all the treasury shares that are unlikely to be exercised and of all shares not initially allocated to cover of a specific stock option plan.
All of these methods are consistent with ANC Regulation 2014-03.
Other marketable securities Marketable securities are recorded at cost.
A provision for impairment is recognized if the value in use is lower than the carrying amount.
1.8 Bonds
In early September 2012, the Company issued a 145 million euro bond in the form of a European Private Placement.
This bond, issued with a 6.5 year maturity, was redeemed in full on March 11, 2019.
1.9 Events after the reporting date
None.

Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Objectives and audit approach
Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:
-- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
-- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.
-- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.
-- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.
-- Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding

6

the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

As far as the Company is aware, no other Shareholder currently owns, directly or indirectly, solely or jointly, more than 5% of the share capital or voting rights. No significant changes in the Shareholder base took place between the end of the fiscal year and the date this document was established. The Company is controlled as described above. The measures taken to protect against abusive exercise of control are:

In line with its values, the Bonduelle Group put in place governance rules many years ago, and in 2008 adopted the principles of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code. In this area, and in line with the recommendations of the Autorité des marchés financiers (French financial markets authority ­ AMF), in September 2011 the group introduced a Stock Market Code of Conduct. The Code, which is available at www.bonduelle.com, was updated in 2018.

has subsequently been renewed every year; each party to the agreement may withdraw from the agreement one year prior.
A third agreement, canceling and replacing the previous agreements and with modifications made to certain provisions, was set in place in 2008 for an initial period of five years, renewable every year upon the expiration of that period. Each party may withdraw from the agreement one year prior to each renewal date. The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) considered that, under the provisions of this agreement, the signatories were acting in concert (AMF opinion No. 214C0595 of April 17, 2014).
In light of these agreements, the joint action observed by the Autorité des marchés financiers accounted at June 30, 2019 for 49.66% of the Company's share capital and 60.95% of the 51,172,453 theoretical voting rights.
Threshold crossings
On July 11, 2017, Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS declared that it had crossed in the upward direction, on a direct and indirect basis, through La Plaine, a company it controls, the threshold of 30% of the capital of Bonduelle and that it held, as of that date, directly and indirectly, 9,635,124 Bonduelle shares representing 18,476,064 voting rights, i.e. 30.11% of the Company's capital and 36.95% of its voting rights. This threshold crossing resulted from an off-market acquisition of Bonduelle shares. On this occasion, the concert party comprising Bonduelle's family Shareholders did not cross any thresholds. This concert party accordingly declared that, as of July 11, 2017, it held 15,464,932 Bonduelle shares representing 30,128,890 voting rights, i.e. 48.33% of the Company's share capital and 60.26% of its voting rights (AMF Opinion No. 217C2749 of November 27, 2017).
For this threshold crossing, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) examined, at its meeting of December 12, 2017, a request for exemption from the obligation to file a public offer for the shares of Bonduelle, which applies in the framework of a change in the Company's shareholding structure. Between June 30, 2017 and July 11, 2017, Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS acquired 100,000 Bonduelle shares (of which 64,348 shares acquired on July 11, 2017). As a result of these purchases, on July 11, 2017, Bonduelle's family Shareholders held 15,464,932 Bonduelle shares representing 30,128,890 voting rights, i.e. 48.33% of the Company's capital and 60.26% of its voting rights. This caused Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS to cross in the upward direction, directly and indirectly, through La Plaine SAS, a company it controls, the threshold of 30% of the capital of Bonduelle, thereby triggering the obligation to file a public offer for all Bonduelle shares, in accordance with Article 234-2 of the AMF General Regulation [...]. Considering that Bonduelle's family Shareholders already held, prior to the above-mentioned purchases, 60.06% of the voting rights of Bonduelle, representing the majority of the voting rights of the Company, the Autorité des marchés financiers granted the requested dispensation on the regulatory ground cited (AMF Opinion No. 217C2910 of December 13, 2017).

At its meeting of May 15, 2018, the Autorité des marchés financiers examined a request for exemption from the obligation to file a public offer for the shares of Bonduelle, which also applies in the framework of a change in the Company's shareholding structure. Between July 11, 2017 and April 26, 2018, Pierre and Benoît Bonduelle SAS acquired 420,414 Bonduelle shares, directly and indirectly, through La Plaine SA, a company it controls. As a result of these purchases, on April 26, 2018, Bonduelle's family Shareholders held 15,928,431 Bonduelle shares representing 30,602,032 voting rights, i.e. 49.34% of the Company's capital and 60.73% of its voting rights. This means that Bonduelle's family Shareholders, together with Pierre and Benoît Bonduelle SAS, between July 11, 2017 and April 26, 2018, increased their equity holdings, initially between 30% and 50%, by more than 1% over less than 12 consecutive months, thereby triggering an obligation to submit a public offer for all of Bonduelle's shares, in accordance with Article 234-5 of the AMF General Regulation [...]. Considering that Bonduelle's family Shareholders already held, prior to the above-mentioned purchases, 60.26% of the voting rights of Bonduelle, representing the majority of the voting rights of the Company, the Autorité des marchés financiers granted the requested dispensation on the regulatory ground cited (AMF Opinion No. 218C0885 of May 16, 2018).
In a letter received on January 15, 2019, and in another letter received on January 16, 2019, Bonduelle's family Shareholders declared that on January 9, 2019 they had crossed in an upward direction the threshold of 50% of the capital of Bonduelle and that they held 16,307,593 Bonduelle shares representing 31,002,475 voting rights, i.e. 50.12% of the Company's capital and 60.39% of its voting rights. This threshold crossing was due to exercise of the option to receive payment of the Company dividend in Bonduelle shares (AMF opinion No. 219C0117 of January 17, 2019).
The Autorité des marchés financiers received a letter on July 17, 2019, and another letter on July 22, 2019, reporting the following threshold crossings, for adjustment purposes:
-- the simplified joint stock company, Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS (La Woestyne, 59173 Renescure, France), declared that it had crossed in an upward direction, on an individual basis, on December 31, 2018, following the allocation of double voting rights, the threshold of 10% of voting rights in Bonduelle; and
-- Bonduelle's family Shareholders declared that, on April 15, 2019, further to the exit of certain Shareholders from the concert action following their termination of the agreement entered into on April 15, 2008, they had crossed, in a downward direction, the threshold of 50% of the capital of Bonduelle and that they held 16,157,034 Bonduelle shares representing 31,189,119 voting rights, i.e. 49.66% of the Company's capital and 60.95% of its voting rights.

These same letters included the following declaration of intent:

-- Pierre et Benoît Bonduelle SAS, acting in concert, does not envisage modifying its strategy in relation to Bonduelle nor implementing, within Bonduelle, any one of the operations referred to in Article 223-17 I, 6 of the AMF General Regulation;

7 INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND THE SHARE CAPITAL
Description of the share repurchase program
7.5 Description of the share repurchase program

Pursuant to the provisions of the delegated regulation of March 8, 2016 supplementing EC regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European parliament and of the Council with technical regulatory standards regarding the terms applicable to share repurchase programs and to stabilization measures, the purpose of this description is to describe the goals and methods of the Company's program to repurchase its own shares. This program will be submitted for the authorization of the Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2019. The notice of the meeting is to be published in the BALO of October 28, 2019.
Number of shares held directly and indirectly: 449,743 shares.
7.5.1 Analysis by intended use of treasury shares held at August 31, 2019
Number of shares held by intended use:
-- ensure liquidity of Bonduelle shares under an AMAFIcompliant liquidity contract: 21,050;
-- acquisition-related transactions: 81,066;
-- coverage for share purchase option plans and other types of share allocations to employees: 347,627;
-- coverage of securities conferring rights to allocations of Company shares: 0;
-- cancellation: 0.
7.5.2 Detailed description of the share repurchase program
-- Authorization of the program: Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2019
-- Securities involved: common shares
-- Maximum portion of the share capital that may be repurchased under the authorization: 10% (or 3,253,834 shares on the present date), it being specified that this limit shall be evaluated on the repurchase date to reflect any capital increases or decreases during the term of the program. The number of shares taken into account for the calculation of this limit corresponds to the number of shares purchased, less the number of shares sold under the liquidity contract during the program.

As the Company may not hold more than 10% of its own share capital (as of August 31, 2019, 449,743 shares or 1.38% of the share capital), the maximum number of shares that may be purchased will be 2,804,091 (i.e. 8.62% of the share capital), subject to the sale or cancellation of some or all of the shares already held.
-- Maximum purchase price: 60 euros
-- Maximum program amount: 195,230,040 euros
-- Methods used: These share purchases may be made using all available methods, including block purchases, and at such times as the General Management chooses.
The Company reserves the right to use options or derivative instruments in accordance with all applicable regulations.
The General Management will be given full powers to repurchase shares, decide on the terms and conditions, enter into any agreements and complete all necessary formalities, subject to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2019.
-- Objectives:
· ensure secondary market trading or liquidity for
Bonduelle shares through an investment service provider on the basis of a liquidity contract compliant with regulatory practice, it being specified that in this context, the number of shares used in calculating the aforementioned limit is the number of shares purchased less the number of shares resold;
· hold the shares acquired for subsequent use in exchange
or as payment in connection with any potential acquisition;
· ensure that sufficient shares are available to cover needs
generated by share purchase option plans and/or free share plans (or similar plans) granted to employees and/ or Corporate Officers of the group, as well as any share awards as part of a company or group savings plan (or similar plan), employee profit sharing and/or any other form of allocation of shares to employees and/or Corporate Officers of the group;
· provide coverage for securities giving rights to allocations
of Company shares in accordance with applicable regulations;
· cancel any shares purchased, in accordance with the
approval granted, or to be granted, by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting.
-- Term of the program: 18 months from the Shareholders' Meeting of December 5, 2019, i.e. until June 4, 2021.

7 INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND THE SHARE CAPITAL
General information regarding the Company

Any persons invited by the General Management or by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board are also allowed to attend meetings.
The General Partner is represented by one of its legal representatives or by any person, who may or may not be a Shareholder, mandated by one of the latter.
Shareholders who take part in meetings through videoconferencing or other telecommunications media enabling their identification and permitted under the conditions stipulated by applicable laws and regulations shall be considered to be present in the calculation of the quorum and majority, provided the General Management elects to use such means of participation prior to sending the notice convening the Shareholders' Meeting.
Meetings are presided over by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or, if the latter is not available, the Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board or, if the latter is not available, by the General Management.
Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings ruling under the conditions prescribed by law, exercise their functions in accordance with the law.
Except for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Supervisory Board, the appointment and dismissal of Statutory Auditors and the approval of regulated agreements, no decision of the meetings will be valid unless it is approved in writing by the General Partner no later than the end of the Shareholders' Meeting that approved said decision.
The Company's General Management has full powers to record such approval, and shall append the document manifesting such approval to the minutes of the meeting in question.
Double voting right (established by the
Extraordinary session of the Combined Ordinary
and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of
October 24, 1997 in its 10th ­ Article 12 of the
Articles of association)
Holders of fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the holder for more than three years shall be entitled to double voting rights. Double voting rights shall apply at all Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings.
The legal provisions concerning double voting rights are set out below:
-- in the event of an increase in the share capital by capitalization of reserves, net income or additional paidin capital, double voting rights shall be attributed from the date of issue to registered shares allotted free of charge to a Shareholder as a result of their ownership of existing shares that are already entitled to double voting rights. (Article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial Code);
-- any share converted into a bearer share or whose ownership is transferred loses the double voting rights assigned in application of Article L. 225-123. However, the transfer of

shares as a result of inheritance, liquidation of a community of assets between spouses or inter vivos gifts to a spouse or relative whose degree of relationship is sufficiently close, does not result in the loss of entitlement to the right acquired and does not interrupt the qualification period mentioned in the first paragraph of Article L. 225123. Unless otherwise stipulated in the Company's Articles of association, the same shall apply to the assignment of double voting rights in the event of a transfer following a merger or split involving a company that holds shares in the Company.
A merger or split of the Company shall have no effect on the double voting rights that may be exercised within the beneficiary company or companies, provided that this is established in the latter's Articles of association. (Article L. 225124 of the French Commercial Code).
Separation of voting rights between the usufructuary and the bare owner
(Article 12 of the Articles of association)
The Articles of association currently provide that, unless there is an agreement notified to the Company, where there is a separation of ownership rights, voting rights shall belong to the bare owner, except in the case of collective decisions relating to the appropriation of income, when voting rights shall belong to the usufructuary.

Important events or developments in the Company
1853-1926
Origins: birth of a legend
The Company was founded by two individuals: Louis Bonduelle-Dalle (1802-1880) and Louis Lesaffre-Roussel (1802-1869). Both came from farming families in the Nord department of France. In 1853, the two men decided to build a grain and juniper distillery in Marquette-lez-Lille. In 1862, they bought a farm in Renescure (France) which they converted into a grain alcohol distillery.

Relationships with third parties
The General Management has full powers to act in the Company's name under any circumstances. It exercises these powers within the limits of the Company's corporate purpose and any powers granted explicitly by law to the Supervisory Board and to the Shareholders' Meeting.

1926-1946
Canning business takes off
In 1926, they installed their first pea sheller and autoclaves in the family farm at Woestyne. Bonduelle started canning 20 hectares of peas, corresponding to annual production of approximately 120 tonnes.

Relationships between partners

In 1936, they expanded the farm to 230 hectares, and the canning plant also grew considerably.

General information regarding the Company

1963-1974
Sharp expansion
In 1968, advances in technology enabled the Company to freeze vegetables, a development which would become a great success. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several European subsidiaries were created: in Germany (1969), Italy (1972) and the United Kingdom (1973). Subsidiaries in other countries soon followed. By 1973, more than half of Bonduelle's revenues were generated outside France.
1975-1984
Period of expansion: beyond Picardie
Bonduelle embarked on a business development drive that took it to the south west of France, the Oise department north of Paris and then Belgium. This geographical expansion led the Company to invest in two new sectors: corn and mushrooms. In 1980, Bonduelle acquired Marie-Thumas, the largest vegetable canning company in Belgium and a leading brand in this market for 100 years. In 1983, its production capacity was optimized: 350,000 tonnes of canned vegetables and 9,000 tonnes of frozen vegetables. Its position as European leader in processed vegetables is very secure!
1985-1993
Conquering Europe
Creation of subsidiaries in Spain (1986) and Portugal (1988). At the end of 1989, Bonduelle acquired Cassegrain. The group started expanding into Eastern Europe, marketing its products in the former East Germany, the Czech Republic and, beginning in 1992, Poland. In 1986, the Renescure (France) and Bordères (France) production facilities obtained ISO 9002 certification, followed soon after by the group's other production sites.
1994-1999
Growth within and beyond Europe, the group's third business line: fresh foods, and its initial public offering
In 1995, the brand adopted a new visual identity as a symbol of renewal: a shining sun and a band of greenery that conjured up nature, pleasure, and well-being. Bonduelle opened a sales subsidiary in Brazil in 1994, then another in Argentina in 1996 and began its development in Russia.

Further technological advances enabled Bonduelle to develop its expertise in the prepared fresh vegetables segment. It acquired a majority stake in Salade Minute.
In 1998, the Bonduelle brand expanded into the fresh foods market in France and signed a partnership agreement with Cielo e Campo, Italy's number two in the fresh-cut range. In June 1999, Bonduelle's fresh-cut vegetables appeared on Italian supermarket shelves.
In the spring of 1998, the group was listed on the Second Marché of the Paris Stock Exchange.
In November 1999, Bonduelle took part in the vegetable canning industry consolidation in France by acquiring the assets of Avril/Cirio France (French private labels).
To raise its profile, Bonduelle decided to sponsor the construction of a multi-hull yacht in October 1999 and chose skipper Jean Le Cam from Brittany to compete in sailing races. The values evident in this sport are a perfect fit for Bonduelle: nature, well-being, technology and vitality.
2000 to 2012
Growth and continued expansion
2000 -- Organization of the group into a federation of subsidiaries;
-- Takeover of Cielo e Campo (fresh foods, Italy), already a partner since 1998;
-- Creation of Bonduelle Frische (fresh foods, Germany).
2001 -- Merger of Cielo e Campo/Ortobell (Italian fresh foods
market leader), which contributed its two plants in San Paolo d'Argon (Bergamo ­ Italy) and Battipaglia (Salerno ­ Italy), which was under construction.
2003 -- Acquisition of Vita, the market leader in fresh-cut
vegetables in Germany and its plants at Reutlingen and Wanzleben;
-- 150th anniversary;
-- Acquisition of the Békéscsaba plant in Hungary;
-- Acquisition of Michel Caugant ­ Creation of a sixth subsidiary;
-- Sports sponsorship: launch of the program to build a singlehull boat and participation in the Vendée Globe Challenge in 2004.
2004 -- The Novotitarovskaya plant opens in Russia.
2006-2007
Conquering North America In June 2006, the Bonduelle Group acquired a minority shareholding in Aliments Carrière, the leading producer of canned and frozen vegetables in Canada.

General information regarding the Company

2007-2008
On July 12, 2007, the Bonduelle Group took full control of the leading producer of canned and frozen vegetables in Canada. This acquisition has enabled the Bonduelle Group to operate in North America on a long-term basis.

In the United States, the acquisition of the Allens frozen business will enable the subsidiary Bonduelle North America to expand its presence in the country, and to become a key player in the frozen food sector in North America.

2008-2009 In November 2008, Bonduelle acquired La Corbeille, a Belgian producer and distributor of canned vegetables that focuses on the private label sector in Northern Europe.
2009-2010
Bonduelle, European leader in processed mushrooms During this period, the group acquired the France Champignon Group, Europe's leading producer of processed mushrooms (revenue of around 200 million euros).
France Champignon produces and sells mushrooms in all formats (canned, fresh, pasteurized and dehydrated) and of all kinds (white mushrooms and wild mushrooms) in Europe.

2012 to today
VegeGo! an ambition for 2025 2012 saw Bonduelle initiate a new phase in its development to define a vision for the group to 2025. A process involving the family Shareholders, the members of the Executive Committee, 300 Managers and external experts culminated in the launch of VegeGo! at the end of 2012.
A visionary and collaborative transformation plan, the aim of VegeGo! is to position the Bonduelle Group as "the world reference in `well-living' through plant-based food", wholeheartedly embracing its responsibilities to Shareholders, employees, partners, customers and the environment.

2010-2011
Operations in Brazil
Industrial operations and commercial development in Brazil The group has had a presence in Brazil since the mid-1990s, in both canned and frozen vegetables, mainly through the use of imported products, and enjoys good market shares and strong recognition.
The industrial operations in Brazil, which began in September 2010, include the construction of a canning plant (primarily for peas and corn) in the Brasilia region. This region enjoys clement weather conditions that greatly extend the annual growing period, thereby reducing capital requirements (production facilities and inventory carrying costs).

Organized since 2013 in business units, each dedicated to a technology/geographic region pairing, the group promotes autonomous and flexible operational entities that are responsible for executing its development strategy.
2012-2016
All-time high activity and profitability Now operating on an international scale with one-third of its sales in France, one-third in Europe outside France and onethird outside Europe, Bonduelle celebrated its 160th year in the agro-industrial business in 2012-2013, and its 15th year on the financial markets. In 2014-2015, the group achieved a historic high in revenue and current operating income, a record that it has surpassed in 2015-2016 at constant exchange rates.
