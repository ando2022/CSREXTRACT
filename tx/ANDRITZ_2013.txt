Pumps (for water transport, irrigation, and applications for various industries) and turbogenerators for thermal power stations are also part of the business area.
Market development 2013 Global project activity for electromechanical equipment in hydropower plants was satisfactory in 2013. It was, however, still substantially below the very high level of the previous years. Investment activity was generally subdued. In addition to modernization and rehabilitation projects in Europe and North America, some new hydropower projects in

ANDRITZ PULP & PAPER
is a leading global supplier of equipment, systems, and services for the production and processing of all types of pulps, paper, tissue, and cardboard. The technologies cover the processing of logs, annual fibers, and waste paper; the production of chemical pulp, mechanical pulp, and recycled fibers; the recovery and reuse of chemicals; the preparation of paper machine furnish; the production of paper, tissue, and board; the calendering and coating of paper; as well as treatment of reject materials and sludge. The service range includes modernization, rebuilds, spare and wear parts, service and maintenance, as well as machine transfer and second-hand equipment. Biomass, steam, and recovery boilers, gasification plants for energy production, flue gas cleaning plants, production equipment for biofuel (second generation) and biomass pelleting, biomass torrefaction, plants for the production of nonwovens, dissolving pulp, plastic films, and panelboards (MDF), and recycling plants are also allocated to the business area.

Market development 2013 The international pulp market saw a positive development in 2013. Rising demand, particularly from international tissue and packaging paper producers, combined with a stable supply, led to a price increase in long-fiber pulp (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) from around 790 US dollars per ton at the beginning of January to approximately 860 US dollars per ton by the end of 2013. The price of short-fiber pulp (for example eucalyptus) also increased slightly ­ rising from around 750 US dollars per ton at the beginning of January to approximately 780 US dollars per ton at the end of 2013. Whereas the first half of the year was marked by substantial price increases as a result of steady demand from China, there was an oversupply in the second half of the year as a result of new capacities, which caused a slight drop in prices. The market for pulp mill equipment developed very well. A number of larger modernization orders were awarded. There was also substantial investment and project activity for new pulp mills. However, the competitive environment for pulp equipment suppliers remained challenging with high price pressure, particularly on large projects.

fully consolidated as from March 1, 2013, is also part of the business area. As global market and technology leader in metal forming, Schuler supplies machines, production lines, dies, process know-how, and services for the entire metalworking industry. Its customers include car manufacturers and their suppliers, as well as companies in the forging, household equipment, packaging, energy, and electrical industries. Schuler is also the market leader in coin minting technology and offers system solutions for the aerospace and railway industries.

Market development 2013 Despite signs of slowing demand, project activity in the metal forming sector for the automotive and automotive supply industries was satisfactory in 2013. Due to continuing overcapacities in the international steel and stainless steel industry and the weak demand for stainless steel caused by the general economic climate, project activity for plants and equipment for the production and processing of stainless steel strip remained very low during the reporting period. In contrast, there was satisfactory investment activity for industrial furnaces.

Based on 150 years of experience, ANDRITZ SEPARATION is a long-term service partner for the entire life cycle of customer plants, including delivery of wear and spare parts, modernization, and process optimization.

Market development 2013 Investment activity for solid/liquid separation equipment saw varied development in the industries served by ANDRITZ during 2013. Driven by the growth in population in the emerging markets and tightening environmental restrictions, investment and project activity in the municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sectors, and in the food industry, was relatively solid. Low project activity and several project delays and cancellations were noted in the chemical industry. Investment activity in the mining industry also continued to be low. Project activity in the animal feed industry was good ­ both for mill expansion projects and new greenfield plants.

"We stick to our
long-term
growth targets"

Wolfgang Leitner
Responsibility: President and CEO, central Group functions
Wolfgang Leitner on the problematic pulp mill project in South America: "Following a very successful initial order in Uruguay in 2007, this project has turned into a very big challenge, both for us and for our customers."

A fter a disappointing business year in 2013 and in view of the continuing moderate economic development worldwide, ANDRITZ has taken operational and organizational measures in order to secure its long-term goal of profitable growth. An interview with the members of the ANDRITZ Executive Board on failure, success, and challenges in 2014.

INTERVIEW WITH THE EXECUTIVE BOARD 9

Karl Hornhofer on large EPC projects that include substantial risks: "We will be even more selective on these projects in future."

Mr Leitner, after many years of continuously rising profits, in 2013 the ANDRITZ GROUP's net income has fallen substantially in spite of increasing sales figures ­ earnings were even below the level of 2009, the year of the worldwide crisis. What are the reasons for this?
Wolfgang Leitner: The financial development of ANDRITZ in 2013 was marked essentially by three factors. First of all, there were increased expenditures and provisions for a pulp mill in South America to which ANDRITZ not only supplied the production technologies and equipment, but was also responsible for construction and erection of the entire mill. The second reason for the decline in earnings was provisions planned from the outset for continuation of the strategy and growth program by the Schuler Group, acquired in the first quarter of 2013. Thirdly, we had substantial additional costs in the SEPARATION business area for the market launch of products in China. The very good development in the HYDRO business area was only able to make up for a part of these burdens.

What were the difficulties at the pulp mill in South America? And have they now been resolved?
Leitner: Following a very successful initial order in Uruguay in 2007, this project has turned into a very big challenge, both for us and for our customers. The problems in the execution of this project were long strikes by the staff of local sub-suppliers on the site, organized by the trade unions. As a result of the strikes, which affected both sub-suppliers to the pulp mill project ­ including ANDRITZ and its sub-suppliers ­ and the customer to an equal extent, there were considerable delays in the execution of the project and, as a result, substantial additional costs. We had higher expenditures for this reason. These external factors over which we had no influence were not foreseeable when the contract was signed in 2011. At that time, the project fulfilled all requirements for a successful project. ANDRITZ had successfully completed a very similar pulp mill project in good cooperation with the customer in Fray Bentos in 2007 ­ in the same country, with the same sub-suppliers, and the same plant capacity.
What lessons has ANDRITZ learned from this? Will the company continue to take on EPC projects ­ projects including construction and erection of entire plants ­ despite these risks?
Karl Hornhofer: EPC projects always come with certain risks ­ risks that can be managed, but not avoided altogether. In future, however, ANDRITZ will be even more selective on EPC projects. We will limit our activities to projects where EPC-based supply carries a higher value and benefit for our customers than supply of the equipment only and where our customers are also willing

Karl Hornhofer
Responsibility: PULP & PAPER (Capital Systems), Group-wide Quality and Safety Management
to pay a fair price for this added value. In addition, we will offer alternative supply structures ­ on an open book basis for example, where the supplier's costs are disclosed in order to obtain complete transparency in terms of cost causation and cost origins, or supply structures in collaboration with other companies who act as general contractors.
Let's move on to another important topic for ANDRITZ ­ the Schuler Group, which has been a part of the ANDRITZ GROUP since March 2013. How is business going at Schuler, and why have provisions been made there?
Leitner: Schuler has developed very well, even exceeding our expectations to some extent. However, we expect a slight decline in business in 2014 due to market developments. Taking account of this and in order to continue the growth and strategy project started by Schuler in 2011 for the integration of the Müller-Weingarten company, we will make some operational and organizational adjustments.

10

Friedrich Papst: As far as organizational measures are concerned, we have implemented a number of measures already in 2013, such as downsizing the Executive Board from five to four members, reducing the number of second-level managers in Germany, and streamlining the complex group structure. In the operational business, the adjustments will focus on three areas: concentration on core competencies, expanding business in the service sector, and strengthening our presence in growth markets. This will create a firm basis, ensuring that Schuler is also well prepared for the needs of the market in terms of its competitive position, growth, and earnings.
Business development in the SEPARATION business area was well below expectations in 2013. Surprising, because these were the very industries and markets that market researchers considered to be long-term growth areas. What were the reasons for this?
Humbert Köfler: As far as earnings are concerned, the development was significantly below expectations and was thus certainly not satisfactory. Technical difficulties arose while we were launching some products on the Chinese market and relocating these products to our Chinese production facilities. These difficulties led to major additional costs. We have made progress in resolving the difficulties, but we have not finished yet. As for the order intake, the mining and the chemical industries continued to be very cautious in their investments. On the other hand, the municipal sector and the food industry were very stable. Speaking of the food industry, ANDRITZ Gouda, which was acquired in 2012 and which serves
Friedrich Papst on adjustments in the Schuler Group, which was acquired in 2013: "This will create a firm basis, ensuring that Schuler is also well prepared for the needs of the market in terms of its competitive position, growth, and earnings."

this industry, showed very positive development in 2013, both in terms of sales and earnings.
Papst: On a further positive note, the animal feed and biomass sectors also saw excellent development. We were able to achieve a new record in order intake, particularly in the pet food and aquatic feed segments, where we further strengthened our market position.
Mr Semper, the HYDRO business area ­ the largest of the ANDRITZ business areas together with PULP & PAPER ­ also developed very well in 2013, particularly its earnings and margin. However, the order intake was slightly below the very high levels of the previous years. Do you think this is a long-term change in the hydropower market or only a shortterm, market-related fluctuation?
Wolfgang Semper: We certainly do not expect a change in the long-term structural growth drivers in the hydropower market. Following the years of strong growth up to 2011, the market for hydropower equipment has returned to normal again in the past few years, which is absolutely natural after growth phases of this kind. We were able to maintain our order intake at a high level, which means that we were able to strengthen our market position and even extend it in some areas. The longterm drivers in the hydropower market are unchanged and will continue to uphold the business in the medium
Wolfgang Semper on the hydropower market: "Following the years of strong growth up to 2011, the market has returned to normal again in the past few years, which is absolutely natural after growth phases of this kind. We certainly do not expect a change in the long-term structural growth drivers."

and long term. The trend worldwide is moving towards clean, renewable energy sources, where hydropower with its share of 80 percent is the most important energy resource. The refurbishment needs of existing power stations, particularly in Europe and North America, are enormous. At the same time, we expect large hydropower plants to be built in many emerging countries in order to satisfy the sharply rising demand for power as a result of the economic and population growth in these countries. Topics such as energy storage to offset temporary power deficits as well as intelligent power networks are also relevant for us. So the overall prospects are good.
On the subject of prospects, what are your views on the global economy in 2014 and on development by ANDRITZ, Mr. Leitner?
Leitner: I don't expect a sustained recovery in the global economy, and, as a result, in our markets in 2014. Customers will continue to act with caution, investing at relatively short notice and only implementing investment plans step by step. Nevertheless we expect some large orders to be placed in the HYDRO and the PULP & PAPER

business areas, and we think our chances are good due to our market position. Competition, however, will continue to be strong and challenging. As a result, we will also make some selective adjustments to the company's organizational structure and capacity in 2014 to adjust our cost structure in order to remain competitive. Nevertheless, we will not take any measures that limit our longterm goal of profitable growth for the ANDRITZ GROUP. We stick to our long-term growth targets. And we will continue to look out for interesting companies and products that can further strengthen our competitive position and broaden our sales markets. As we have a high level of cash liquidity, we have every opportunity to achieve further internal and external growth. Thank you for this interview!

T he 2013 business year was disappointing for the ANDRITZ GROUP. Although such key financial figures as sales, order intake, and order backlog rose significantly due to consolidation of the Schuler Group, earnings and profitability saw a considerable decline. The main financial developments in detail:
Sales of the Group amounted to 5.710,8 MEUR in the 2013 business year and were thus 10.3% higher than the reference figure for the previous year (2012: 5,176.9 MEUR). This increase is due to consolidation of the Schuler Group, which has contributed 966.6 MEUR sales since its first-time consolidation as of March 1, 2013.
The order intake rose by 13.9% compared to the previous year, reaching 5,611.0 MEUR in 2013 (2012: 4,924.4 MEUR), with the Schuler Group contributing 868.4 MEUR.
The order backlog amounted to 7,388.5 MEUR as of December 31, 2013, an increase of 11.7% compared to the end of last year (December 31, 2012: 6,614.8 MEUR). The Schuler Group contributed 1,040.4 MEUR to the order backlog.
Earnings (EBITA) amounted to 164.1 MEUR and were thus 54.1% below the reference figure for the previous year (2012: 357.8 MEUR). The EBITA margin declined to 2.9% (2012: 6.9%). The main reasons for this substantial decline are high provisions and expenses in the PULP & PAPER business area for cost overruns in connection with supplies to a pulp mill in South America, additional costs in the SEPARATION business area for the market launch of a new product series in China, as well as planned provisions and expenses for continuation of the growth and strategy project initiated by Schuler in 2011.
Net income (excluding non-controlling interests) amounted to 66.6 MEUR (-72.6% vs. 2012: 242.7 MEUR).
Due to consolidation of the Schuler Group, total assets of the ANDRITZ GROUP as of December 31, 2013 increased to 5,571.4 MEUR (year-end 2012: 5,161.0 MEUR). Thus, the equity ratio declined to 16.7%
(year-end 2012: 20.0%). Gross liquid funds amounted to 1,517.0 MEUR (December 31, 2012: 2,047.8 MEUR). Due
to the acquisition of Schuler, the net liquidity, at 893.1 MEUR, significantly declined compared to the reference figure as of end of 2012 (1,285.7 MEUR).

30 million people live in the Andean country of Peru ­ one
tenth of them still without electricity. Most of us take electricity in our homes for granted, but for the Peruvian population, it is the distinction
between rich and poor. A report on life in Peru: with
and without electricity.

"My daughter needs

Four-year-old Zaritha Mainicta (left page) had no electricity in her home until only recently. Her greatest wish: "A television set like my friend Judith has." Her friend, Judith Oruel (right page), has had electricity in her house for a few years now.

Alejandro Labra is one of three million Peruvians who live without electricity. The fiftyyear-old farmer knows why more and more people want to live with electricity: "People are not as frugal as they used to be."

A beaten path leads up the valley from where the dirt road comes to an end. A box hung from a steel cable takes visitors across the thundering river. The walk up to the small settlement in the mountains just below the legendary Inca city of Machu Picchu is arduous, but is worth it if you want to feel how it is when the past and the future collide. We're here to visit Alejandro Labra, who is still living without electricity, and his sister-in-law Rosmery Mainicta, who recently laid a kilometer-long cable through the wilderness so that she can use the newfangled energy source from the socket to power a light-bulb ­ all so that her four-year-old daughter Zaritha can do her homework by light.
The settlement is made up of a few wind-battered wooden huts. Day-to-day life in this remote area is difficult. It is still dark when the cock first begins to crow. Alejandro Labra feels around in the darkness for his clothes and the machete.

They are both always in the same place and the 50-year-old farmer finds them without trouble. He then brews some coffee on a wood fire. In his youth he would take a candle, later an oil lamp ­ the technological advance, which he too yearns for, is only slowly coming to this isolated mountain region.
By the time dawn starts to break behind the high mountaintops at five o'clock, Alejandro Labra is already at work on his fields, sowing tomatoes, weeding, collecting honey, or fertilizing the orange trees. Both his father and grandfather also worked in this way, and not much has changed in the way of work since the times of the Incas. In the afternoon, Labra has work to do on the farmyard: chickens, ducks, and guinea pigs have to be fed, tools need to be repaired, firewood chopped. When it becomes dark and the day's work is done, he likes to sit on the wooden bench next to his hut listening to the news on his old battery-powered portable radio. He has no electricity in his hut. He is one of three million Peruvians who live without electricity.
"These people usually live in poverty in remote areas", says Luis Antonio Nicho Díaz, Director of Electricity at the Peruvian Ministry for Energy. "But their situation will soon improve." Peru has plenty of potential for electricity production, especially in the area of hydropower, which is already the most important energy source today. According to the Ministry's figures, hydropower plants currently produce more than 23,000 gigawatt hours of electricity annually ­ that's more than half of Peru's total electricity use.
"The government wants to diversify energy production and expand renewable energy", reports Luis Antonio Nicho Díaz. Because the energy demand of the booming Andean country is constantly on the rise (up by more than 30% since 2008), energy production plays an important strategic role in the future development of the country. The economy grew by 6.3% in 2012 and it is expected to grow by around 6.0% in 2013. Furthermore, Peru wants to establish a network with neighboring countries Chile and Ecuador to import or export energy according to their needs. The capital expenditure for that has risen, according to figures from the Trade Association for Mining, Oil, and Energy, from 170 million euros in 2003 to
The Santa Teresa hydropower plant is expected to connect to the grid in 2014, supplying 98.5 megawatts.
two billion euros in 2012. This investment comes largely from private companies. And demand is growing further: Peru's electricity consumption is currently at just over 43,000 gigawatt hours per year. In ten years' time, it is expected to have more than doubled to 95,000 gigawatt hours, according to the Ministry's estimates. "Hydropower is going to play a key role here in future too", says Díaz. Thirty six new hydropower plants are planned by 2023.
Back in the present, back in the little settlement near Machu Picchu, back to the farmer Alejandro Labra. One of these new hydropower plants, Santa Teresa, is currently being built

five kilometers upstream along the Vilcanota River. The facility, which is being planned by the private power supply company Luz del Sur, is being blown out of the mountain below ground and uses the drainage channel of the Machu Picchu power plant 188 meters further up. The Santa Teresa hydropower plant is expected to connect to the grid in 2014, supplying 98.5 megawatts. As part of the project, ANDRITZ HYDRO is supplying two Francis turbines as well as the generators, among other equipment. The new facility poses technical challenges because the power of the Vilcanota pulls large masses of stones and sediments with it. Appropriate steps must be taken by ANDRITZ to protect
the turbines in the new power station. The Machu Picchu power station, which first came on stream in the 1960s and which is equipped also with ANDRITZ technology, has already brought progress to Santa Teresa: construction work is going on everywhere in the small town. The old wood and clay huts are giving way to stone houses. Countless families have moved here from the surrounding countryside. But the people here are not as frugal as they used to be, ac-
cording to Alejandro Labra. His sister-inlaw Rosmery Mainicta, for example, felt that her home was far too dark and so recently had an electric cable laid down from the neighboring farm. The electricity meter will be installed soon. The wooden posts that carry the electricity cable over a deep ravine and a turbulent river stand a little crooked. Whether they'll survive the next rainy season is doubtful. But Rosmery Mainicta is not concerned by that. "I need a fridge so that I can store meat and milk for longer periods of time," says the 32-year-old. "And a socket to recharge my mobile

phone. And my daughter needs light so that she can do her homework." The bright-eyed four-year-old Zaritha is Alejandro Labra's pride and joy. "Today's youth is much better educated than we were", reflects Labra. The little one is in pre-school during the day, then she goes to her mother who runs a kiosk at the thermal baths of Santa Teresa. The two don't get home until the evening.
During his youth, Alejandro Labra had to work on his parents' farm and had to do his homework in the evenings under the glow of a candle or oil lamp. "I sometimes fell asleep doing it, knocking over the lamp in the process", he remembers. At best only the book was stained, at worst the straw roof of the hut caught fire. For young Zaritha, these are just wild stories of yesteryear. While she does her homework in the light of the naked light bulb that's dangling above the kitchen table from the corrugated tin roof, she tells us her deepest wishes. What she really wants is a television set like her friend Judith, who lives half an hour further upriver in Collpani.
Collpani has already had electricity for a few years. The residents have taken advantage of that, turning their living rooms into little kiosks where they sell sweets, toilet paper, ice creams, and cold drinks. Judith lives on the coffee grove up on the hillside. Her mother Sabina Oruel says: "We used to have to salt meat and fish to conserve them." Now it's enough to just open the fridge door. She has dreams of owning a washing machine but has not yet saved enough money for one. Her eldest daughter would like to have a computer. "All in good time", says the mother. The electricity bill is already high enough. "Some months I have to pay up to 100 soles", she sighs ­ that's around 26 euros. "And that's although using energy saving lamps."
Despite that, the 35-year-old woman doesn't want to do without soap operas and TV news in the evenings. Her daughter Judith, on the other hand, is more of a Tom and Jerry fan. But her mother pulls the plug out every afternoon to make sure she doesn't forget to do her homework despite the television, just to be on the safe side.

Families in the mountain villages close to the legendary Inca city of Machu Picchu still hear the news from a battery-operated radio set because there is no electricity supply. Like four-year-old Zaritha Mainicta (photo on the left-hand page), many people in the remote areas of Peru live in poverty. But their situation should improve when the power grid is expanded. The Peruvian government has chosen to do this with hydropower.

22
22,000,000,000,000
kilowatt-hours
Annual production of electricity has more than trebled worldwide since 1970 because of global economic and population growth. More than 22,000 terawatt-hours of electricity are generated every year, which is more than 22 billion kilowatt-hours. Approximately one fifth of the global power generation comes from environmentally and climate friendly, renewable energy sources ­ around 80% of which is hydropower. In comparison: this proportion of hydropower from the total electricity production of one year alone would meet the current power demand of Austria, with around 8.5 million inhabitants, for over 50 years. In previous years, electricity production from hydropower increased annually by approximately 2% on average in the OECD countries, and in non-OECD countries by around 4%. The strong economic growth in countries like China, India, and Brazil, the increasing environmental and climate protection measures by many countries, and the ever shorter supply of fossil fuel resources mean that power generation from hydropower will very probably continue to rise in the future. ANDRITZ HYDRO is one of the leaders in this growth market.

Pelton turbine
The Pelton turbine ­ patented in 1880 by the American engineer Lester Pelton as a further development of the classic mill-wheel ­ uses the energy in a jet of water that enters the turbine at high speed to transform hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. For example, if water in a storage power station drops 1,800 meters through penstocks from a reservoir on the plateau of a mountain, the water jet can reach a speed of up to 666 kilometers per hour. A Pelton turbine rotates with up to 3,000 revolutions per minute. The turbine's efficiency can be up to 92%.

Francis turbine
This turbine, named after the American engineer James B. Francis (1815-1892), is the most commonly used turbine type today. It is ideal for heads of up to 600 meters and for large water volumes in run-of-river power plants with large heads and in storage and pumped storage power stations. In the Francis spiral turbine, a helical tube referred to as the spiral creates additional swirl in the water and then directs it towards the opposite curved turbine runner blades by means of a fixed guide apparatus (wicket gate) with adjustable guide vanes. The turbine's efficiency can be up to 97%.

25
How do

turbines work?
Kaplan turbine
In 1912, the Austrian engineer Viktor Kaplan filed a patent for his invention as a further development of the Francis turbine. The turbine has a runner that looks like a marine screw propeller. However, the propeller vanes are adjustable, with the result that the turbine can be adjusted easily to handle different flow rates. The Kaplan turbine is usually installed vertically, thus the water flows vertically downwards through it. Primarily, it is used in run-of-river power stations because it operates efficiently at low heads (up to 25 meters) and fluctuating flow rates. The turbine has four or up to a maximum of eight runner blades, depending on the head. The turbine's efficiency can be up to 96%.

*Efficiency is a measure of performance of energy conversion and thus describes the ratio between the power input and the effective power output. Using a light bulb as an example: of the 100% electric power input, 95% is converted into thermal energy and only 5% into light power. Thus, the efficiency is 5%. Hydroelectric turbines achieve efficiency of up to 97% depending on the turbine type. The efficiency of a hydropower station can be up to 95%, taking slight losses as a result of generators, transformers, energy leakages, and the plant's own energy consumption into account.

Potential and advantages of hydropower
According to research by market experts, only about one third of the global hydropower potential has been developed so far. Compared to other sources of energy, hydropower offers substantial benefits:
Water is a renewable source of energy. Hydropower is a clean form of energy generation, it does not leave any environmentally harmful residues, and
it contributes substantially towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Hydropower makes a major contribution towards stabilizing power grids and provides a solid foundation for
further development of volatile energy sources like wind and solar energy. In many regions of the world, water reservoirs are vitally important for water supply, irrigation, transportation,
and flood control. Compared to other energy sources, hydroelectric power generation is cost-efficient and not sensitive to fuel
price increases. Hydropower preserves fossil fuel resources. Construction of hydropower plants creates local jobs and supports regional economies.

turbines each with an output of 32.3 megawatts. Nam Lik 1 will supply 200,000 people in Laos with electrical energy from renewable resources.
For the Albanian utility company KESH, the business area will refurbish the complete electromechanical equipment at the Komani hydropower station, which is the largest hydropower plant in Albania with an output of 624 megawatts and covers around one fifth of the country's entire power consumption.
Kraftwerke Oberhasli, Switzerland, ordered the supply of two Pelton turbines (150 and 90 megawatts) as part of the project to expand Innertkirchen 1 and Handeck 2 hydropower stations. The project to modernize the two power plants built over 60 years ago makes a substantial contribution towards covering peak energy demand to compensate for volatile wind and solar energy supplies. As a result of the modernization, an additional 70 gigawatt-hours will be generated every year, thus covering the energy demand for more than 14,000 households.
The business area will supply two 90-megawatt Francis turbines to BKK Produksjon, Norway's second largest utility company, for the Matre-Haugsdal hydropower plant. Eidsiva Vannkraft, also in Norway, awarded a contract to increase the output of two Francis turbines at the Øvre Vinstra hydropower station. The two runners

Pumps safeguard life and survival
The various uses of ANDRITZ pumps include irrigation of agricultural land. So this technology meets one of the prerequisites for growing grain and rice crops. Here is one example: the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is hit frequently by widespread drought. As some 70% of the population makes a living directly or indirectly from agriculture, the Indian government launched the Jalayagnam project for irrigation of agricultural land. ANDRITZ is fitting a total of eleven pumping stations with spiral casing pumps. It would only take three of these large pumps, with an impeller diameter of up to four meters, to fill an Olympic swimming pool with 2,500 m³ of water in under 20 seconds!

Revolution
The rapid growth of the internet is revolutionizing not only our daily life, but also the pulp and paper market. Because of strong growth in internet retail trading, the global market for cardboard and packing paper is booming. Goods ordered online have to be well packaged to ensure that they reach the buyer undamaged. The world's largest online retailer, the Chinese company Alibaba, sends a total of 4.4 billion parcels each year. One of the largest ANDRITZ cardboard machines is installed in China.

W hen Lilian Lee sees clothes or shoes she likes, she first turns to the internet. "It's cheaper and more convenient to order things online", says the 25-year-old event manager from Shanghai. "And within just two days, the products have arrived." Lilian Lee does around half her shopping on the internet. By now she is even buying food online. "It's still hard to find milk in Shanghai, but more than anything I just can't be bothered to carry the things home." Lilian Lee is one of 250 million people who regularly shop online in China ­ the largest e-commerce market in the world.
The top dog in China is Alibaba, which has its headquarters in Hangzhou near Shanghai. Goods totaling 126 billion euros were sold on the company's online platforms in 2012 ­ as much as eBay and Amazon combined. The company, founded by English teacher Jack Ma in 1994, achieved earnings of 358 million euros in 2012 and has a staff of 24,000 employees. The company's flagship platforms are Taobao and Tmall. Taobao is similar to eBay, while Tmall is comparable to Amazon.
Alibaba has profoundly changed business in China. "E-commerce is a revolution in China", confirms Porter Erisman, a long-standing employee at the online giant. "Suddenly a lot of young people can set up new companies, because it can be done cheaply

on the internet." In a politically restricted environment, global online trading is a small piece of freedom for many Chinese. What's more, it allows many people in more remote regions to become consumers for the first time.
By now, orders placed on Taobao and Tmall make up almost two thirds of all parcels sent in China ­ that's an average of around 12 million parcels of all sizes each day. The boom in orders broke a new record on Singles' Day on November 11, 2013, a holiday for unmarried, single Chinese: on that day, employees at Alibaba packed 152 million parcels!
Such numbers are a huge logistical challenge: large parts of China are still difficult to reach. Logistics companies such as STO, who transport the parcels ordered online to customers,

in 2012 ­ as much as eBay and Amazon combined.
are therefore increasingly relying on air transport. That is the only way this booming market can be served, explains company spokesperson Shen Tao. One fifth of all deliveries are already carried out by air. In 2012, DHL, the world's market leader in logistics, opened its new Chinese hub at Pudong airport in Shanghai to enable it to better serve this booming market. Like DHL, their competitors FedEX and UPS are also experiencing (low) double-digit growth thanks to e-commerce.
Over the last five years, online retailing has grown by an average annual rate of 13%. In the USA, for example, around one in ten retail sales is now made online. And since everything that is ordered online has to be packaged before being sent to

The ten most important online retail markets

the customer, the growth of e-commerce is a blessing for the packaging industry. Along with population growth, online retail is the most important driver of growth for this industry ­ mainly, although not only, in China.
One of the largest producers of packaging material in China is Nine Dragons. Zhang Yin founded the company in 1995 and it has become one of the global market leaders, making Zhang Yin one of the richest women in China. With the production of more than 12 million tons of boxes and packing paper, the publicly listed company achieved sales of 3.3 billion euros in 2012. That is 6% higher than the previous year. According to the company, this can also be attributed to the growing online sector. Production is carried out using 33 cardboard and paper machines in China, Vietnam, and in Mongolia. One of Nine Dragons' larger cardboard machines was supplied by ANDRITZ PULP & PAPER. The machine produces up to 1,100 tons of containerboard ­ each day!
By 2015 Nine Dragons wants to increase production to 14 million tons to meet increasing demand ­ because Alibaba

is also expanding further. Alibaba boss Jack Ma wants to list his company on the Hong Kong or US stock exchange in 2014. According to current estimates by financial analysts, the flotation should bring at least 50 billion euros into the Alibaba coffers. The company wants to use that to expand, with new South Asian markets such as Indonesia and India on the agenda. Most importantly, however, the Chinese market will grow further, because at the moment only less than half of the Chinese population uses the internet. According to market forecasts, by 2020 the Chinese e-commerce market will already be bigger than that of France, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and the USA combined.

First past the post
375 billion letters and parcels of various sizes are sent every year worldwide. 190 million tons of cardboard and corrugated paper were produced for all types of parcels in 2012 (+34% compared to 2003: 143 million tons). The packaging industry has annual sales of 227 billion euros worldwide. The worldwide per-capita consumption of cardboard and corrugated paper was 27 kilograms in 2012 (+20% compared to 2003: 22 kilograms). This was highest in the USA, with 110 kilograms, followed by Western and Northern Europe (71 kilograms), China (40), Eastern Europe and South America (24), and Africa (3).

F ranz Rappold is on the Executive Board of Mayr-Melnhof (MM) Karton AG in Vienna, Austria. MM Karton is the world's leading producer of coated recycled cardboard and the company is growing its business in the areas of virgin fiber-based cardboard and premium coated packing paper. MM Packaging is Europe's leading producer of folding boxboards and has a growing presence outside of Europe.
What effect has the boom in online retailing had on your company?
Rappold: Brand appearance from conventional retailing is carried over into the online retailing arm: here the recognition factor for the buyer is achieved primarily through recognizable packaging. The packaging is therefore an important part of brand appearance. Folding boxboard packaging is taking a central role ­ in online retailing as well as on the highstreet ­ due to its versatile functionality. As online retailing grows, the business of shipping packaging produced using sustainable or recycled raw material is growing strongly with it, thereby fulfilling the demands of consumers and producers for sustainability.

Which markets are growing? Demand for boxes and folding box-
boards correlates to a large degree with general economy, especially in terms of private consumption. Our aim is to accompany our customers as they expand in growing markets, and to assist them in growing sustainably over the long term. We're seeing lots of growth potential in Eastern Europe, in Turkey, and in Russia. One of the industries growing most strongly is the pharmaceutical industry.
Why do you produce with Andritz machines?
Andritz has been a professional and competent supplier of machines and plants for the packaging industry for decades. They are innovative and well-positioned globally. Andritz is competitive internationally. To put it briefly: Andritz is a solid and trusted partner of ours.

30 million tons of tissue per year
Tissue is an absorbent, finely creped sanitary paper made of chemical pulp or recovered paper. It is normally used in several layers for toilet paper, kitchen rolls, napkins and handkerchiefs, facial and cosmetic wipes, and for hand towels, and is manufactured on special paper machines. At the center of these machines is the Yankee, with diameters of up to 6.7 meters, on which the paper web is dried within a few tenths of a second by a hood at a temperature around 500 °C. Annual production of tissue is over 30 million tons. The largest manufacturers are in North America (with a share of just under 30%), Western and Eastern Europe (around 25%), and China (approximately 17%); in the past decade, China was by far the largest growth market with annual growth of 8%. The largest consumers of tissue are the North Americans, with annual consumption of 24 kilograms per capita, followed by the Western Europeans and the Japanese (each with annual consumption of 15 kilograms) ­ by contrast, this figure in China is only just short of four kilograms per capita.

70 billion packs of paper tissues or 12 billion rolls of toilet paper
ANDRITZ is one of the leading suppliers of pulp producing equipment worldwide. New pulp mills have very high production capacities: A single new pulp mill has an average annual production of up to 1.2 million tons of pulp. The pulp is used to produce different paper products for example. In order to obtain such paper properties as softness and tear resistance, a mix of long fibers (for example from spruce), short fibers (eucalyptus for example), and/or recycling fibers is used in pulp production. 1.2 million tons of pulp would be enough to produce 70 billion packs of paper tissues (each containing ten 3-ply paper tissues) or 12 billion rolls of toilet paper!

An electric jolt
for the automotive industry
A visionary entrepreneur from California is revolutionizing the market for electric cars. Essential components of his most successful car, the Tesla Model S, are manufactured using press lines from Schuler, member of the ANDRITZ GROUP since 2013.

Elon Musk founded Tesla and set new standards for the entire automobile industry with his electric cars. The 42-year-old visionary and self-made billionaire knows all about setting new standards: Musk has built a profitable, private space launch center to take satellites into orbit and soon intends creating a colony of 80,000 humans on Mars.

E lon Musk is a 42-year-old man with a vision: he wants to take on mankind's ecological, social, and economic challenges, and find sustainable solutions for the future. No idea is too big ­ he has built a profitable, private space launch center to take satellites into orbit (SpaceX), and he wants to create a colony of 80,000 humans on Mars. In the future, in just 35 minutes goods and passengers will

be transported the 600 kilometers between Los Angeles and San Francisco in pneumatic tubes at speeds above 1,200 kilometers per hour ­ faster and cheaper than any other mode of transportation (Hyperloop).
Clearly, the self-made billionaire is full of ideas. And one thing that proves that he can turn these visionary ideas into impressive realities is Tesla Motors, a company which Elon Musk and four other investors founded in 2003. It has become the world's largest manufacturer of cars with purely electric drive systems. When Elon Musk built the factory where the Tesla is produced, most other car manufacturers did not yet believe in the electric car, and were at best experimenting with hybrid vehicles. Robert Lutz, CEO of General Motors, freely admits that seeing the first Tesla S in 2009 was "the crowbar that helped break up the logjam". His engineers had told him that lithium battery technology was still at least ten years away ­ "and boom, along comes Tesla."
And how the Tesla came along! The Model S has become the best-selling car of the year in some US markets, as well as in Norway (where sales are subsidized with tax breaks). The sedan, which seats five adults, produces zero emissions, but has performance data to match any luxury gas-guzzler: 362 horsepower, from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 5.6 seconds, top speed 200 kilometers per hour.
The only way to achieve this is by building an ultra-light aluminum body, which compensates for the nearly 800 kilograms that the battery pack adds to the overall weight. The body
is nevertheless strong and safe, thanks to the German press line manufacturer and ANDRITZ member Schuler. In crash tests, the Tesla S outperformed all existing safety ratings in the history of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), earning a rating of 5.4 out of the officially possible 5.0! In the factory in Fremont, California, where the Tesla Sedan is built, a large Schuler press line shapes aluminum body parts, including side panels, roofs, engine hoods, doors, trunk lids, and fenders. These hydraulic press lines are capable of processing sheet metal up to four meters long and two meters wide, which makes it possible to produce entire side panels, from fender to fender, in one piece. This reduces the number of welding points, which increases the stiffness of the parts. This modern Schuler technology also

enables to use stiffer materials, with a high tensile strength and low weight, to build the components with a minimum number of processing steps and a maximum amount of precision.
"Therefore it is important that the speed of the presses' moving parts can be adjusted at practically any time during the forming process", explains Frank Viola, Automotive Sales Manager at Schuler. The company is the global market and technology leader in this field. Practically all the major automobile manufacturers in the world use press lines made by Schuler.

While an electric car buyer in the USA (where about 30% of all electric cars worldwide are manufactured) cares primarily for fuel economy, Asian customers view electric motors mainly as a way to reduce dependency on imported oil. In Europe, on the other hand, electric cars are seen as an answer to climate change: the German government, for

It is not only sheet metal that is used for electric cars: the interior of the electric BMW i3, for example, is not made from aluminum, but from carbon. A Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) process is used, which reduces the weight by 60% compared to conventional steel. For this process, the i3 manufacturing plant in Leipzig, Germany, is equipped with hydraulic press lines from Schuler. These press lines use a time-controlled injection and molding process, with forces up to 36,000 kilonewtons, to produce perfectly finished hardened parts up to 3.6 meters long and 2.4 meters wide in four to eight minutes.
Schuler is the global market and technology leader in metal forming and member of the ANDRITZ GROUP since

example, has projected a target of one million electric cars on German roads by 2020.
"E-Mobility has reached the production line", announced Thomas Weber, member of the Daimler Executive Board. Almost every manufacturer has at least one electric vehicle in their product range. Nissan has been producing their purely electric Leaf since 2010, and has sold over 71,000 so far. In November 2013, BMW launched the batterypowered i3 into a market which seemed to be awaiting it anxiously: thousands of customers had pre-ordered the car without ever having seen it. Mercedes will begin supplying its B-Class Electric Drive in 2014, with a power train made by Tesla. Mass production for the

Driving the Tesla S with zero emissions, just like being in a luxury gasguzzler: 362 horsepower, from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 5.6 seconds, top speed 200 kilometers per hour.

Chevrolet Volt started in the USA in 2010, and it has been sold in Europe since 2011, under the name Opel Ampera. Despite an entry price of 70,000 euros, about 20,000 of the Tesla Model S have been sold since its introduction in June 2012. That figure is expected to double in 2014.
Currently, however, production can barely keep up with demand: BMW already has a waiting list of up to five months for its i3, and also Elon Musk can't produce as many cars as the market demands.

The bottleneck for the production of the Tesla ­ and essentially for the manufacture of electronic cars globally ­ is the supply of lithium-ion batteries. Panasonic, Tesla's main supplier of batteries, intends increasing its deliveries tenfold in the next four years. However, even this will not be enough, according to Musk: "If we want to produce 500,000 cars a year, we need a corresponding number of batteries ­ that would be almost on par with the amount of lithium-ion production in the world today."
And he wouldn't be Elon Musk, if he had not decided to find a solution to this challenge too. He wants to build the largest battery factory in the world, whose capacity will exceed all existing production plants combined.

Since 1994, ANDRITZ has supplied more than 170 DAAR rings (DAAR: Dispositif D'Accrochage Arrière) for Ariane ­ a series of European launcher rockets developed on behalf of ESA and which carry satellites into space. DAAR rings are retaining rings for the rockets' solid propellant boosters. Ariane 5 has two 30 meter high auxiliary solid-fuel rockets (boosters) that each provide 540 tons of propulsive force in the initial launch phase for a firing time of 130 seconds. The rings certainly have the shortest life time of all ANDRITZ products. They are jettisoned together with the boosters only a few minutes after a rocket is launched. A DAAR ring weighs 750 kilograms and has an outer diameter of 3.5 meters. It is precision-machined from a special steel blank weighing 2.2 tons. The ring combines maximum possible strength with lowest possible mass and must be manufactured with absolute precision in order to meet the stringent requirements of the aerospace industry.

with ANDRITZ and Schuler

Large investments are under way worldwide in extending high-speed rail links. Turkey is also expanding its railroad system on a large scale and is planning to double its network to 25,000 kilometers by 2023 according to government announcements. The Turkish steel producer Kardemir, which has been supplying rails for the national rail network for decades, placed an order with Schuler in 2013 for delivery of a complete production line for the manufacture of high-grade railway wheels ­ the largest individual order in Schuler's history so far. The new production line will supply 200,000 wheels a year. Schuler, part of the ANDRITZ GROUP since 2013, will deliver

hydraulic presses and a newly developed wheel rolling machine, which shapes railway wheels from steel blanks weighing up to 500 kilograms, as well as the testing and inspection technology for the finish-machined wheels. ANDRITZ Maerz, the specialist for industrial furnace systems in the ANDRITZ GROUP, is supplying the fully automated heat treatment line for the railway wheels, comprising furnace equipment and hardening machines. Among the deciding factors in the award of this order were the proven technologies from ANDRITZ and Schuler, which fulfill the highest standards in terms of safety and service life for railway wheels used in high-speed trains.

Little Star-
Gourmets

Small children are big gourmets. The baby food market is growing worldwide ­ demand has risen especially in Russia and China. All the large baby food producers use machines made by ANDRITZ Gouda.

62

The world market leader for baby food, Nestlé, has been a customer of ANDRITZ Gouda for almost 60 years. The photos show examples of various baby food for different markets: Cerelac for Asia, Gerber for North America, and Pyjama Papje for Europe.

Y ou'll be able to smell why there is no alternative to our drum dryer for the production of cereal-based baby food", says Alexander de Jager, Key Account Manager at ANDRITZ Gouda, before we enter the room that contains the testing facility at the company's headquarters in Waddinxveen, the Netherlands.
Through the glass door that leads to the testing facility we can see a technical room containing stainless steel machines. The smell that meets me is not unlike that at a bakery: what appears to be endlessly streaming out of the ANDRITZ Gouda drum dryer as a paper-thin beige sheet, emits a pleasantly sweet smell. "This smell is produced as a result of the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic browning process, while starch and proteins react with each other, which is vital for a good end product", explains de Jager.
The first step in the production of instant baby cereals is mixing the ingredients with water (slurry preparation). This slurry is then fed to the drum dryer, processed to form a thin film, then cooked and dried within one rotation. That is what makes this machine so unique: The drum dryer combines

four steps. As well as being dried, the slurry is pasteurized by the heat, making it non-perishable. The starch in the slurry is gelatinized so that the product can be digested, and this also ensures that it is easily soluble when reconstituted. The result is a smooth and light porridge that feels pleasant in the baby's mouth. The Maillard reactions mentioned previously create the elements that are so important for the smell, the taste, and the color of the baby food. The final product that is scraped off the drum is a thin film of 0.2 millimeters with about 4-5% residual moisture. Finally, the dried product is ground to a powder from which the consumer can make baby porridge by adding water or milk.
New recipes by ANDRITZ customers are tested in the pilot laboratory to ensure that the baby porridge is to the liking of the little star gourmets and their parents. As part of this process, a number of the machine's settings are experimented with, such as varying production temperatures or speeds. After the test runs, the process data are analyzed in the laboratory
next to the testing facility, and the samples undergo intensive taste tests by the customer. "That way we can give all of our customers a recommendation regarding the perfect machine settings for their product", explains Alexander de Jager. The drum dryer looks like a simple machine from the outside ­ "but the devil is in the detail," explains Hidde Frankena, Managing Director of ANDRITZ Gouda and member of the family from which ANDRITZ acquired the com-
pany, founded in 1909: "The individual parts have to work perfectly together, like clockwork. If there is just one tiny anomaly, it has an effect on quality." Each single gram of instant powder, for example, has to contain the same amount of nutrients.

ANDRITZ Gouda: world's market leader for drying machines for production of baby food
Founded as a family business in 1909 and part of the ANDRITZ GROUP since 2012, today ANDRITZ Gouda employs 170 people, and delivers machines and complete production lines for the food, environment, and chemical industries worldwide from seven locations. As always with the ANDRITZ GROUP, new solutions are continuously being developed with customers. One of the most important challenges for the future, according to Managing Director Hidde Frankena, is the further development of machines and process solutions with a focus on increasing energy efficiency and reliability. The first ANDRITZ Gouda drum dryer was developed in 1916. Since then, this machine has become the company's main product and has already been installed in more than 130 countries, making ANDRITZ Gouda the world's leading supplier of drying machines for the production of baby food.

The market for baby food is booming
According to figures by Transparency Market Research, the worldwide market for baby food is currently 28 billion euros a year. The market research company expects this to grow to 47 billion euros by 2017. The countries with the highest rates of growth are China (annual growth of up to 22%) and Russia (annual growth of up to 24%), where rising birth rates and growing prosperity are driving demand. Another market driver, also in western countries, is the rising level of families with two working parents. Consequently, the parents have less and less time to prepare food for their babies themselves, meaning that demand for instant baby food is increasing.

ANDRITZ's customers are extremely demanding when it comes to production technology. That is understandable considering the fact that they're selling a product that not only has to meet the demands of strict food laws, but also the high expectations of consumers regarding quality and hygiene. ANDRITZ Gouda is therefore proud to be able to count all of the world's large producers of baby food as its customers, amongst them Indofood, Danone, Heinz, Hero, Progress, and Nestlé.
The global market leader, Nestlé, has already been working with the Dutch company for almost 60 years. Why? Luc Nicolay, Group Manager at the Nestlé Product Technology Centre in Orbe, Switzerland, explains: "We expect machines that offer high levels of performance and reliability. The machines of ANDRITZ Gouda meet these demands, as proven by more than 100 drum dryers that we have installed at most of our infant cereal plants worldwide over the last few decades. The ANDRITZ drum dryers allow us manufacture our highquality products efficiently and sustainably."

Managing Director Hidde Frankena is pleased to hear this praise from Nestlé because it confirms one of the fundamentals of the ANDRITZ business culture: mutual trust between customer and supplier. "We don't just sell machines. We also sell the knowledge and experience we have gathered over more than 100 years. As a result, customers get the peace of mind that comes from knowing that everything will work perfectly, just as they want it to."

FRom Athens to Zagreb:
Modern technologies
for a
clean environment
Today, around half of the world's population of seven billion people lives in cities, and forecasts by futurologists say that urbanization will continue to increase. This development and the increasingly strict legislation to improve environmental protection are confronting every country worldwide with enormous challenges in municipal sewage and sewage sludge treatment. Waste water treatment technology has reached a stage where the once negative impact of waste water on the environment is now nearly negligible. In addition, more and more people can profit from continuously improving drinking water quality. So far, more than 10,000 wastewater treatment plants have been equipped with technologies from ANDRITZ SEPARATION, dewatering and drying more than nine million tons of sewage sludge per year. These include smaller plants as well as the largest in the world ­ for example in Athens, Bangkok, Barcelona, Beijing, Berlin, Bratislava, Brussels, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Doha, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Kyoto, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Moscow, Munich, New Delhi, New York City, Panama City, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Rotterdam, Santiago, São Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Vienna, and Zagreb.

One of the largest desalination plant operators in the Middle East placed an order to supply decanter centrifuges and conveyors. The desalination plant provides potable water for the city of Dubai.
ANDRITZ SEPARATION received the order to supply a thermal drying system for the municipal solid waste and refuse-derived fuel plant in Swindon, United Kingdom. The supply is based on drying technology of Vandenbroek Thermal Processing, Netherlands, acquired by ANDRITZ in 2013.
The Tai Po water treatment plant, which supplies potable water to Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, will

be equipped with four large membrane filter presses. The fact that ANDRITZ is the only manufacturer that can provide a fully automatic system, allowing operation without continuous operator surveillance, was decisive in the award of this order.
Sarda Mines, India, ordered six membrane filter presses as well as engineering services for a complete filtration plant for the largest iron ore tailings dewatering plant in India. Also in India, seven membrane filter presses for dewatering of leached zinc slurry will be delivered to Binani Zinc.
Ten large belt presses for wastewater treatment were ordered for the Cerro Verde mine, Peru.

In milk production, particularly high quality and safety standards apply. Filters used in the beverages and dairy industries, for example, remove bacteria, germs, proteins, enzymes, and many other components from slurries. ANDRITZ equipment can filter out components down to a size of only seven nanometers. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter, and its size in relation to a meter is approximately that of a hazelnut to the globe.

Why does chocolate melt in your mouth faster than in your hand?
Thanks to ANDRITZ technology, chocolate only melts very slowly in your hand, but very quickly in your mouth. Fractions of vegetable fats and oils with different melting characteristics are separated from one another by means of temperature-controlled crystallization in ANDRITZ machines. The physical principle applied in isolating and cleaning these substances is mechanical solid/liquid separation.

"A Contract with the
Future"
M ore than 800 apprentices are currently being trained by ANDRITZ worldwide ­ many of them in countries with high rates of youth unemployment. An apprenticeship with ANDRITZ gives young people excellent career prospects. Two apprentices tell how their apprenticeships have changed their lives.
How has this apprenticeship changed your life? Iván Gael Vázquez Villegas: It was a huge change for
me at the start, because here they don't just put great emphasis on the marks you get, but also on orderliness, uniform, how we express ourselves, how respectfully we treat each other, and on punctuality ­ and we Mexicans are not exactly known for our punctuality. But I've become used to this new life in the meantime.
Metehan Günay: I moved from my hometown of Adana, which is around 550 kilometers away from here. That was, as you can imagine, a big change for me and my family. When I got here, everything was unfamiliar to me ­ the city, school, and the apprenticeship. I wasn't used to having so many lessons, as I've never had that at any school before. It's far beyond anything I've ever experienced, not just in terms of the number of teaching hours, but also in terms of the quality of the training. For the first time in my life, I have the feeling that I have a successful future in front of me, that I've signed a contract with the future, that everything will be good and success will come. Nobody has been able to give me that feeling of optimism before.
How much do you earn? Günay: I earn 500 lira a month ­ that's a very good
wage for an apprentice in Turkey. Usually in Turkey you're paid a fraction of what we're earning at ANDRITZ, if anything at all. I know a lot of companies that don't pay anything for apprentices.
Villegas: 4,000 pesos a month. That is two and a half times the legal minimum wage.
What do you do with your wages? Villegas: I still live with my mother and most of the
money goes on food, electricity, gas, and water. I usually have around 400 to 500 pesos a month to go to the cinema or to do something with friends. I've also started saving up to get a car. I won't have to spend so much time travelling on the bus each day then. I'm one of the

Metehan Günay (18)
is doing an apprenticeship as a welder at ANDRITZ HYDRO in Mardin, Turkey. In 2012, ANDRITZ, in cooperation with Turkish authorities, opened a training center for young people from the
region along the Syrian border. Up to 36 metalworkers, electricians, and certified welders are all trained here per course. Youth unemployment in this part of Turkey currently is up to 40% ­ the highest in the whole country.

few in my circle of friends who have a job. Many of them have been looking for a job for more than a year now ­ so far in vain.
Günay: I send half of it to my family and I use the other half for day-to-day expenses. It's nice that I can support my family now. Until now, they've been supporting me in material terms, now I can return the favor. It's a good feeling to know that my family can afford things that they couldn't buy before because they lacked the money ­ whether it's a new fridge or a washing machine. Personally I don't have many needs, my family is more important.
Do you still remember your first day as an apprentice?
Villegas: Yes. We were all called to the auditorium. There we were introduced to the instructors, given an introduction to the dual education system, and told what was expected of us. That really motivated me ­ especially the German educational model, which is completely different to the Mexican one. In Mexico, companies usually hire young people as unpaid trainees to begin with.
Günay: What fascinated me most was the fact that every apprentice has their own welding booth, that everyone wears a uniform, and that so much emphasis is put on safety in the workplace. I'd never experienced that before.
What aspects of the apprenticeship do you particularly enjoy?
Günay: I like the practical work more than the theory work. I enjoy welding more than anything.

Villegas: The practical part. I really like working on and with machines and I find the way our instructors communicate their experience fascinating. It's amazing how much they know and they're very patient with us.
Is there anything you'd like to tell your boss? Günay: That I'm full of admiration for my teachers
and I would like to thank them all. Osman Hoca, for example, is a very good teacher. He can put himself in his students' shoes. He finds a solution for every problem, I think that's great.
Villegas: I'd like to thank him for the chance he's given me. I definitely won't let him down. I want to do my part for the company and for Mexico!
What are your plans after having finished your apprenticeship?
Günay: I'd like to go and work abroad. I think that the training I'm getting here is so good that I'll be able to get a job anywhere in the world. If that doesn't work out I'd like to work on one of the hydropower plant projects in Turkey. I also dream of being my own boss, of setting up my own business, and training young people myself. In any case, unemployment is very high in Turkey. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to earn one's living and thus secure the future. I'm taking the first steps in that direction by doing the apprenticeship here.
Villegas: Firstly, I'd like to work for Schuler for three years and then I'd love to study Mechanical Engineering at a German university. That's why I'm learning German at the moment.
