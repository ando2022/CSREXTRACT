(until Q3 2012 the income and costs related to that provision were presented separately in the report, whereas in Q4 2012 these results were offset). In four quarters of 2013 the other income went down by 5.61% compared to the same period of 2012 (PLN 4,065,000) and amounted to PLN 3,837,000. The dominant item in the value for 2013 is income from released impairment losses (PLN 1,669,000) and received damages (PLN 1,057,000). 3.3.2.5 Other costs and other net profits/losses In the fourth quarter of 2013 other profits/losses amounted to PLN -7,333,000, while in the fourth quarter of 2012 they equalled PLN +16,007,000, which means a change of PLN 23,340,000.

Current assets went up by over 37%, with the value of inventories going up by over 100%, trade and other receivables going up by ca. 3%, and cash and cash equivalents going up by over 75%. The increased value of total inventories in the Group is mainly the
30

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

consequence of increased coal inventories of the Parent. The level of coal inventories presented at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 corresponds approximately to eight days of commercial coal production by the Parent.
As at 31 December 2013, the return on assets (ROA) went down by 0.42 p.p. and amounted to 9.00% on the balance-sheet date.
3.3.4.2 Equity and liabilities

Provisions and liabilities went up by over 16% compared to the value as at 31 December 2012: current liabilities increased by 94.62% (in accordance with repayment schedules, for 2014 the repayment of loans in the amount of PLN 421,000,000 is scheduled, which in consequence resulted in reclassification of non-current loans to current loans), while non-current liabilities decreased by 25.03% (PLN -193,477,000) ­ on one hand, loans became current (to be repaid in the upcoming 12 months), and on the other hand, the debt was increased by three tranches of bonds issued by the Parent, having the total value of PLN 200,000,000.

3.3.8.1 Inventory turnover

The inventory turnover ratio as at 31 December 2013 went up by ca. 68% compared to the ratio as at 31 December 2012, which is largely the result of an increase in the value of inventories.

3.3.8.2 Debtors collection rate

The debtors collection rate (calculated on the basis of the balance-sheet item "Trade and other receivables") was 46.4 days (as at 31 December 2013), as compared to 49.3 days (as at 31 December 2012). The decrease in the rate is attributable to a decrease in the average level of other receivables, with growing Group's revenue.

3.3.8.3 Operating cycle

The operating cycle for current assets (a sum of inventory turnover and debtors collection rate) in the analysed period was 69.7 days, as compared to 63.2 days as at 31 December 2012. The time necessary for realising the Group's current assets got longer by 6 days on the average.

3.3.8.4 Creditors payment rate

The creditors payment rate (calculated on the basis of the balance sheet item "Trade and other liabilities") in the period covered by financial information got longer by 5.6 days to 82 days, as compared to the end of 2012. In the analysed period the Group had higher current trade liabilities.

3.3.8.5 Cash conversion cycle

As a result of the trends described above, a cash conversion cycle of ­12.3 days was achieved as at 31 December 2013 compared to ­13.2 as at 31 December 2012. The negative value of the cash conversion cycle means that the Group uses non-interest-bearing borrowed capital.

4 INVESTMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS FOR THE LW BOGDANKA GROUP'S OPERATIONS
4.1 The Group's development strategy and its policy on development directions 4.1.1 LW BOGDANKA S.A.'s development strategy In 2013­2020, the Company plans to achieve, among others, the following strategic objectives:
 to complete its investment process aimed at doubling the production capacity of the mining plant to approx. 11.5 million tonnes of commercial coal in 2015;
 to make additional investments in upgrading its shaft 1.5 in Nadrybie to enable the Company to increase its net production capacity to approx. 12 million tonnes in 2018;
 to double the mine's resources and lifetime to around 2050 by obtaining a licence for and utilising new promising areas (increasing the mine's recoverable reserves from approx. 237 million to approx. 450 million tonnes);
 to strengthen the Company's well-established position as the main supplier of coal, particularly to the commercial power industry by achieving a 20% share in sales of power coal in Poland in 2015, compared to approx. 14% in 2012;
 to continue as the leader in effective mining, while reducing the Company's unit mining cash cost by 15% by 2017 compared to the level in 2012, in real terms;
 to continue as the leader in innovative technical solutions by implementing a Smart Mine project.
In order to pursue their strategy, the Company undertook a number of activities with regard to optimisation of the production process, costs, outsourced services and human resources management.
38

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
The Company estimates that the above strategy will require an average annual expenditure of approx. PLN 600 million in 2013÷2020, including:
 approx. PLN 250 million per annum in development capex to support increased production and productivity;
 approx. PLN 350 million in repeatable opex to maintain the Company's mining levels, upgrade its existing working pits and infrastructure.
The Dividend Policy that is part of the approved Strategy for 2013÷2015, provides for profit distributions to shareholders in the Company equal to 60% of the Company's consolidated net profit. The above level of dividend will allow the Company to use a portion of its profit to co-finance its development expenditure on the one hand and to ensure a return of investment in its shares for its shareholders by making dividend payments at an above-average level in the coal mining industry on the other.
The Management Board's recommendation regarding dividend payments may be affected by changes to the assumptions relating to:
 the Company's development and its plans of further expansion;  the implementation of the Company's investment plan;  the Company's plans to maintain its liquidity at appropriate levels; and to  the net profit disclosed in the Company's separate financial statements;  the planned investment and other capital expenditure;  the current possibilities and costs of obtaining debt financing;  the adoption, by the Company's General Shareholders Meeting, a resolution on a dividend level different
from that recommended by the Management Board;  other factors materially affecting the Company's financial standing. 4.1.2 Development strategy of Lczyska Energetyka Sp. z o.o. The Management Board of Lczyska Energetyka Sp. z o.o. in Bogdanka has set the following strategic objectives for the Company to be completed until 2017: 1) Building the Water Treatment Station (SUW), including process connections with the hydrophore unit and the Heat-Generating Plant area. The Water Treatment Station, using the water that will come from draining the mine, will be producing potable water, water to make up for heat network losses, and water to make up for losses in the cooling cycle and in the water and steam cycle of the Heat and Power Station being designed. The Water Treatment Station will be situated in the area of the existing liquid waste treatment plant, which will still be operated, whereas its final section will be situated in the existing water softening building adapted to new purposes. The first stage of the investment (construction of the Water Treatment Station for the existing infrastructure) will be financed from own funds and third-party funds, and the second stage ­ related closely with the extension of the heat plant into heat and power station ­ will be financed with third-party funds. In the period between April and December 2013 the Company conducted a tendering procedure with regard to the first stage of the investment. In December 2013 the Company concluded a contract for the execution of a turnkey water treatment plant construction project to meet the needs of the existing infrastructure. The net
39

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

value of the contract amounts to PLN 33,225,550.61 and the facility is expected to be put to use by the end of May 2015.
2) Construction of a warehousing and garage facility in Bogdanka.
The construction of a warehousing and garage facility in Bogdanka will improve the storage conditions in the warehouse and provide a better space for keeping heavy duty machinery and company cars. The work on that investment commenced in August 2013. The net value of the whole project amounts to PLN 2,660,000.00 and the work is scheduled for completion by the end of July 2014.
3) Feasibility study concerning the construction of a 69 MWt and 77 MWe power unit with the required auxiliary installations.
Detailed economic, financial and technical analyses are currently being carried out regarding this venture with a view to enabling the Company's management and owners to reach the decision (by the end of August 2014) on the future of that investment.
4) Modernisation of Bogdanka-Lczna heat distribution network.
Modernisation of the heat distribution network at Bogdanka-Lczna section will mean replacement of the existing insulation at the heat supply main by the new insulation layer, of higher thermal protecting parameters (lower thermal conductivity). Execution of this task will add to reduction of loss during transmission of thermal energy at this section.

4.1.3 Development strategy of EkoTrans Bogdanka Sp. z o.o. In 2014 and onwards the Company is planning to conduct business operations related to mining waste management. The Company aims to recover and recycle nearly 2.5 million tons of waste generated by dry and wet coal processing annually. 4.1.4 Development strategy of RG Bogdanka Sp. z o.o.

4.2.3 Subsidiaries
4.2.3.1 Investments of Lczyska Energetyka Sp. z o.o.
4.2.3.2 Investment execution in 2013
In 2013 Lczyska Energetyka incurred expenditure on construction in progress to the amount of PLN 14,375,000, with a major share of the funds allocated towards the modernisation and extension of a boiler house
44

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
in Bogdanka. The remaining costs included the modernisation of buildings and structures related to heating and water and sewage management operations, as well as the purchase of machinery and equipment.
4.2.3.3 Plans for 2014
The planned investment expenditure of Lczyska Energetyka for 2014 stands at PLN 22,705,000. Out of this amount PLN 15,025,000 has been allocated towards the construction of a water treatment plant to process and treat the "underground" mining water generated by draining the LW Bogdanka S.A. coal mine, including the construction of technological connections to the water pressure boosting station and the heating plant premises. In the period between April and December 2013 the Company conducted a tendering procedure. In December 2013 the Company concluded a contract for the execution of a turnkey water treatment plant construction project to meet the needs of the existing infrastructure. The net value of the contract amounts to PLN 33,226,000 and the facility is expected to be put to use by the end of May 2015.
As part of intra-group investments (subject to consolidation) Lczyska Energetyka Sp. z o. o. in Bogdanka purchased from LW Bogdanka heating assets with a carrying amount of PLN 9,974,000. The transaction was executed on 22 January 2014 under Agreement No. 97/O/2014, the selling price for the assets stood at PLN 9,974,000.
The investment concept involving the extension of the heating plant into a heat and power plant is currently undergoing in-depth evaluation in terms of economic, financial and technical aspects. These analyses should help the Company determine the scope and development directions of the planned investment.
4.2.3.4 Investments of EkoTrans Bogdanka and RG Bogdanka
In 2013 the newly-established subsidiaries, EkoTrans Bogdanka and RG Bogdanka, incurred investment expenditure totalling PLN 273,234.71. These expenses were related directly to launching and continuing business operations.
4.3 Investments and capital investments of GK LW BOGDANKA S.A.
The value of cash held by the Group as at the end of December 2013 stood at PLN 289,916,000, of which PLN 255,810,000 was held by the Parent. Out of the amount of PLN 255,810,000:
 non-current assets accounted for PLN 77,912,000,
 current assets accounted for PLN 177,898,000.
The amount of PLN 77,912,000 includes the financial resources accumulated by the Company as part of the Mine Closure Fund and intended to cover the cost of mining plant liquidation (these funds are kept in a long-term bank deposit).
The amount of PLN 177,898,000 includes financial resources (available cash) kept in short- and medium-term bank deposits (including overnight deposits) ­ the amount of deposited cash varies depending on the Company's internal income and expenditure forecasts. In accordance with the adopted Strategy, the Company maintains the amount of available cash at the levels equal to the value of average monthly sales revenue (1/12 of forecast annual sales revenue).
Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA did not make any capital expenditure in 2013.
Provided that statutory bodies give their approvals, and Lczyska Energetyka adopts its own development strategy which consists in the construction of a heat and power station, the Company does not rule out the possibility that in 2014 it will participate in the subsidiary's project. Final decision will depend on the choice of a method for implementing the investment.
In 2013, the Company established such company as EkoTrans Bogdanka (10 April 2013), in order to improve its competitiveness with regard to outsourcing services rendered to LW BOGDANKA.
On 4 July 2013, Lubelski Wgiel Bogdanka acquired 100% shares in RG Bogdanka Sp. z o.o. (former Eltrans Mining Spólka z o.o.).

4.4 Assessment of the possibilities of investment plans' execution
The structure of financing property investment expenses will remain compliant with the adopted Strategy, i.e. they will be financed from equity and the debt held (loan and bonds). The Management Board expects an increase in the Group's debt financing. As at the date of providing this Report, the LW BOGDANKA Group sees no threat as to the possibility to acquire additional debt financing, however it indicates that the costs of acquiring the debt as well as the servicing thereof may be higher than currently.
The loan together with issued bonds (totalling PLN 621,000,000), disclosed in the Group's statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, accounted for 25.29% of its equity and 16.15% of the balance-sheet total.
4.5 Research and development works and implementation works in the Group
In 2013, the following research-development and implementation works were performed at the Company:
1. The introduction of the coal-ploughing technique for coal extraction was successful for the extraction walls in the thin seams of the thickness of 1.2 ­ 1.7 m. In March 2013 the extraction of the second wall (7/VII/385) equipped with the first coal-ploughing complex was finished (started at the beginning of October 2011), of the highest length in Polish mining, i.e. over 5 km. In July 2013, in direct vicinity, another wall No. 1/VIII/385 was started, equipped with that complex, with the same length. In November 2013 wall No. 6/VII/385 was started, the second one in the Stefanów Field equipped with coal-ploughing complex Bogdanka-2. In 2013 a contract was signed for the purchase of the third coal-ploughing complex Bogdanka-3, for wall No. 3/VI/385, planned for starting at the end of 2014.
2. In 2013 the works over improving the technological system and mechanical equipment of coal-ploughing systems were continued. Before 2013, two mechanical solutions were introduced that had been developed earlier, for self-loading of the coal "pushed out" by the coal plough to the longwall headings (in the previous technological system the roadheading machines are applied for loading that coal on the crossings of longwall headings and walls), and a powered lining section for pockets at the longwall headings. In 2013 those devices were introduced as a standard. A powered lining section for pockets at the longwall headings was applied not only in coal-ploughing walls, but also after introduction of a certain modification in cutting machine walls in the Bogdanka and Nadrybie Fields.
3. In 2013 underground tests for a new device designed for withdrawing the heading casing during the closedown of the heading during longwall exploitation were carried out. That device largely improves the safety of work with such difficult mining works as closedown of headings during longwall exploitation, and mechanizes the hard works that had been performed manually. At the end of 2013, the first such device was purchased, and it was used in working with the closedown of the longwall heading of wall No. 1/VIII/385 in division G-1 in Stefanów. It is planned that in 2014 further such devices will be purchased.
4. In 2013, together with completion of extraction from wall 2/VI/385 in Nadrybie, the experimental and introduction works were completed, aimed at using the longwall heading twice, and verifying an alternative for the current system of exploitation, in which both longwall headings are closed down together with wall exploitation, and each heading is used once. Generally speaking, the experiment was successful and the exploitation of wall 2/VI/385 was finished as follows: for that wall the over-panel heading was the under-panel heading of the wall 1/VI/385 left behind the front of the wall which was protected with a special protective belt along the whole length of the wall, i.e. about 1,750 m. That heading (after being used twice) was closed down during exploitation of wall No. 2/VI/385. Despite the positive attempt in technical terms, the economic costeffectiveness of that solution, in comparison with the previous method, is quite negative. A comprehensive economic analysis is still to be performed.
5. In 2013 works were continued over developing and introducing a new technology that will allow coal to be extracted with a short-front system, with the simultaneous filling in of the space with the stone coming from the preparatory works or from the initial separation of stone from the material excavated from the walls. Two variants of solutions are under analysis. One is based on a chamber-pillar system, and another is based on short filling longwalls. Variant 1 consists in extraction in the heading system on the basis of the basic headings in a typical yielding-support casing. These workings will be introduced in anchor casings with rectangular cross-sections. The post-exploitation area will be filled with stone. After gaining appropriate experience, the expansion is planned for the scope of activities, by filling the workings with dangerous waste, admissible by
46

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
law to be stored in the mine pit. In variant 2, there would be reinforced a longwall of the length of e.g. 50 m, with the application of a lining for filling longwalls, and the stone would be located in the zone extracted behind the lining. Out of the two solutions, the variant seems more realistic, although it would be more difficult to locate the external waste. Both variants require significant investment outlays and further analyses.
In 2013, within the works into improving the heading casing system, measurements and observations were performed in trial wall No. 1/VIII/385 installed in the over-panel heading in Stefanów, located at the cavities of the excavated wall No. 7/VII/385, the door frame casing made of a new grade of steel with high strength parameters obtained as a result of heat treatment, steel being supplied by Heitzmann (Germany). The casing is an alternative solution for the new steel developed within the research project executed by the Central Mining Institute (Glówny Instytut Górnictwa) in Katowice and the "Labdy" Steelworks in Gliwice, which was tried in the Bogdanka mine in 2011. So far the appraisal is positive, but the complete results will be obtained in the spring of 2014, when the 1/VIII/385 wall will finish the whole trial section of the heading.
4.6 Description of risks, threats and factors which, in the assessment of LW BOGDANKA S.A., will affect the results achieved by the Group at least in the perspective of the upcoming year
4.6.1 Risk associated with the Group's social, economic and market environment
4.6.1.1 Risk associated with the social and economic situation in Poland and the world
The financial results generated by the Group are affected by the rate of increase in domestic and global GDP, particularly the rate of increase in industrial production, the demand for electricity and heat energy, the level of inflation, the rate of unemployment, and changes in exchange rates, etc.
The financial position of the Group is dependent mainly on the position of the Parent, i.e. LW BOGDANKA S.A. In case of significant deterioration in the economic situation of recipients of power coal, or in relation to deterioration in the economic situation in Poland, which would result in decreased demand for electrical and thermal energy, the financial results achieved by the Group may deteriorate. However, due to the fact of having long-term trading agreements, which oblige the recipients to meet certain levels of purchase of power coal, the risk of significant deterioration of the Parent results is reduced. The Parent's financial performance may also deteriorate if the existing taxes or charges (including the mining royalties) are raised or new taxes or charges on hard coal mining are introduced.
4.6.1.2 Risk associated with the economic policy of the State in relation to the hard coal mining sector
The plans of the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of State Treasury concerning the enterprises operating in the hard coal mining and power sector are an important factor influencing the LW BOGDANKA Group's market position. Those plans are set forth in particular in two documents:
 "Strategy for hard coal mining sector in Poland for 2007÷2015" adopted by the Council of Ministers in July 2007,
 "Poland's energy policy until 2025" adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 2004, which includes the consolidation plans for the fuel-energy sector, updated by the "Poland's energy policy until 2030" adopted by the Council of Ministers on 10 November 2009.
Implementation or amendment of the adopted assumptions may have a significant impact on the future competitive position and financial results of the Group.
4.6.1.3 Risk associated with the levels of prices for raw materials for power production in Poland and the world
The levels of prices of raw materials for power production, mainly including the prices of power coal and raw materials which constitute an alternative to power coal (crude oil, natural gas, renewable sources) on global markets and therefore on the domestic market, have key significance for the activities conducted by the LW BOGDANKA Group. The current difficult situation, crisis in the Ukraine, crisis in the Middle East, economic slowdown in China and increases in unsold coal inventories faced by both global and domestic producers due to a decrease in demand for coal may also exert an influence on the change in the demand for fuel, and conse-
47

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
quently, the change in prices of coal and energy on the global and domestic market, which may affect the financial results of the Group. The LW BOGDANKA Group mitigates the risk associated with prices of raw materials for energy production by controlling costs and signing long-term commercial contracts with key customers purchasing power coal.
4.6.1.4 Risk associated with the imposition of coal excise tax
As of 2 January 2012 the provisions of the Excise Tax Act of 6 December 2008 came into force. Under said provisions coal products sold for heating purposes are effectively taxed with excise duty. The Act referred to above and the relevant implementing regulations, despite providing for an extensive range of excise tax exemptions, including both electrical power generation, co-generated electrical power and heat and other selected industry sectors, as well as individual coal buyers, have resulted in a greater number of formal requirements as regards documenting the sale of excise tax-exempt coal.
However, the risk to the Company's operations is limited owing to the fact that LW BOGDANKA S.A. sells most of its coal volumes for electrical power generation purposes and the new domestic excise tax regulations provide for an extensive range of excise tax exemptions, including both electrical power generation, co-generated electrical power and heat and other selected industry sectors, as well as individual coal buyers.
The Company mitigates the excise tax risk by providing excise tax training to the employees, co-operating with reputable tax advisors, by requesting tax authorities to issue individual tax rulings, by active participation in the legislation process, by introducing in trade contracts provisions that enable the transfer of the potential excise tax burden to the buyer in case excise tax is imposed on the transaction.
4.6.1.5 Interest rate risk
The LW BOGDANKA Group is a party to financial agreements based on variable interest rates, therefore it is exposed to a risk of fluctuations in interest rates with respect to loans incurred, as well as in the event of contracting new loans or refinancing the existing ones. A possible increase in interest rates may result in an increase in finance costs of the Company and hence have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results (alternatively, a possible decrease in interest rates may cause a decrease in finance costs of the Company bringing a positive effect on its financial results). In the Group's assessment, the interest rate risk currently has a limited bearing on the financial standing, given a relatively low degree of financing the Group's assets with interest-bearing third party capital. This risk may increase significantly in the case of a considerable growth in debt financing which is related to the group's development strategy currently implemented (extension of the Stefanów Field, investments of Lczyska Energetyka).
4.6.1.6 Risk associated with changes in exchange rates
In February 2013 the Parent concluded an agreement with Caterpillar Global Mining Europe GmbH for the supply of a wall ploughing system; the currency of the Agreement is EUR. A significant change in the EUR exchange rate could have an effect on the Company's financial situation.
In order to secure the Company against foreign exchange risk, LW BOGDANKA S.A. concluded a forward exchange contract. The security covers 100% of the value of the liability under the agreement to purchase a wall ploughing system. As at the publication date of this Report two out of four purchase transactions in EUR have been settled.
In February 2014 the Company concluded an agreement for the supply of a wall ploughing system, also paid for in EUR. The Company is planning to secure itself against foreign exchange risk on terms comparable to those applied in case of the previous purchase.
4.6.1.7 Risk associated with the impact of current macroeconomic situation on debt financing availability
Currently the LW BOGDANKA Group implements a large investment programme associated with increasing the extraction capacity by the Stefanów Field extension. The planned investments are to be financed both with own funds and debt financing (currently totalling PLN 621 million).
At present, the LW BOGDANKA Group sees no threat as to the possibility to acquire additional financing in the form of debt for implementation of its investments, however due to the Company's indebtedness which has been
48

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

increasing over last years, it is estimated that the possible costs of its acquisition might be higher than those currently incurred. The current interest-bearing debt (loan and the issued bonds of the total value of PLN 621,000,000) accounted for 25.29% of Company's equity and 16.15% of the balance-sheet total.

4.6.1.8 Risk associated with the specific nature of mining sector operations and the possibility of unforeseen events

The operating activities of the LW BOGDANKA Group are exposed to risks and dangers beyond its control resulting from the specific nature of conducting activities in the mining industry, especially in the conditions of natural risks. These include events associated with the environment (e.g. industrial and technological malfunctions) and extraordinary events, e.g. geotechnical phenomena, mining disasters, fires or flooding of excavations with mine waters. Such events or phenomena could cause a temporary suspension of the LW BOGDANKA Group's operating activities or losses relating to property, financial assets and employees or could result in the Group being held legally liable. The most important natural hazards occurring in the mine include:



coal dust explosion hazard - class "b";



fire hazard ­ IV self-combustion group (on a five-grade scale);



methane hazard ­ methane category I (on a four-grade scale);



water hazard ­ category I and II (on a three-grade scale);



hazards connected with changing geological and mining conditions at the exploitation fronts.

Another key risk associated with the specific nature of mining operations is mining damage. The relevant legislation, e.g. Geological and Mining Law, the Environmental Protection Law and the Act on the Protection of Agricultural and Forest Land, impose an obligation on mining companies to reclaim post-industrial land, which means they have to incur related costs, which could have an adverse effect on the financial results achieved by the Companies in the future. The Company secures necessary funds to finance costs related to this sphere of activity. The scope of mining damage in the case of LW BOGDANKA S.A. is relatively small, since extraction is performed under little urbanised area. The safety level of the operating conditions in LW BOGDANKA S.A.'s mine is relatively high, which is reflected in the low accident indicators compared to other companies in the industry. This is due to, in particular, the Company's strict compliance with the principles of health and safety in the workplace, ongoing monitoring of threats at individual workstations, appropriate preventative measures, the absence of the risk of mine collapses, gas breakouts and rock outbursts and the relatively low risk of a methane explosion (category 1 methane threat on a four-grade scale). Other factors which reduce the effect of the risk associated with the specific nature of the mining industry on the LW BOGDANKA Group's operations include:



the use of advanced and reliable mining machines and equipment, which reduces the risk of industrial

malfunctions occurring;



no geological disruptions occurring and the fact that the mining seams are relatively regularly laid out;



the relatively low costs of repairing mining damage resulting from the low urbanisation of the area in

which the mine extracts hard coal;



high qualifications of the personnel.

4.6.1.9 Risk of restrictive EU climate policy also with respect to the CO2 emissions

The European Commission requires limiting the CO2 emissions on the level of EU member states by 20% until 2020 in accordance with the so called "Europe 2020 strategy", as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, raising the share of energy consumption produced from renewable sources to 20%, and improving the energy efficiency by 20% in accordance with the so called "20-20-20" targets.

The European Commission is planning to introduce further requirements: cutting CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030 and increasing the share of energy from renewable sources to 27%. The above requirements, unlike the current target of a 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020 set for individual EU Member States, would be binding for the EU as a whole.

In the Polish energy sector, more than 90% of electricity is generated on the basis of coal (hard coal and lignite). The production of electricity from coal is connected with significant CO2 emissions. Limitation of the CO2 emission
49

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
and introduction of a system of obligatory auctions for emission permits may cause significant difficulties in the scope of competitiveness of traditional energy producers and investments in new production capacity. In consequence, the difficulties of the power sector may result in a decrease in the demand for coal in general, or for coal of lower quality. It may have a negative impact on the sales of coal by the LW BOGDANKA Group, and in consequence may have a negative impact on its financial results. This risk is difficult to assess and it is hard to take any activities to mitigate it due to the fact that despite the suggested restrictive EU climate policy the works on the final form of the obligations to decrease to CO2 emissions for particular sectors. At the same time, in the world (the USA, China, Australia) new technologies - i.e. the "clean carbon technologies" have already appeared, which are continuously enhanced technologies and which, when applied, will decrease the problem of CO2 emissions.
The Group is also reviewing the risk of national or regional regulations being introduced that set new emission standards for the existing or new low-power combustion sources in households.
The Group is monitoring any amendments to the Energy Law or other acts that promote generating energy from renewable sources or support the system of producing electricity through high-efficiency co-generation, assessing their potential impact on the Group's operations.
4.6.1.10 Risk of a decrease in demand for hard coal from the Polish power industry
There is a limited risk that the Polish power industry may be able to switch to a significant degree to a raw material other than hard coal within the next 10 years. The LW BOGDANKA Group has long-term contracts which secure it from the risk of a change during the next few years. Poland's long-term power production policy up to 2030 assumes that power production based on hard coal will be maintained. The Group takes measures aimed at further long­term securing of its provision of coal for commercial power production, relating to existing and prospective power units within the area of its operations. Also the imported coal poses some risk to the demand on national coal.
4.6.1.11 Risk of hostile takeover of the Group
As a result of its IPO on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. has been a public company since 25 June 2009. On 9 March 2010, the State Treasury sold, in block trades, 15,882,000 shares it was holding, which accounted for 46.7% of the Company's share capital. In consequence LW BOGDANKA S.A. became a private entity, almost 100% shares of which can be subject of trade on the WSE. This situation poses a risk of the so-called hostile takeover. The Company is implementing its investment programme (Stefanów Field), which is to bring about a growth in the extracting capacity of the mine up to approx. 11.5 million tonnes of coal per year, and consequently, the achievement of better results as well as technical and economic and financial indices. The prospects of such a growth, together with the lack of full economic effects prior to the programme completion, pose a risk of change in control over the Company on terms that would be unfavourable for the existing shareholders.
The Management Board undertakes actions the aim of which is to increase the value of the Company, through improvement of the structure and efficiency of mining and cost optimisation.
4.6.2 Risks directly associated with the Group's operations
4.6.2.1 Risk associated with the launch of extraction of new deposits at LW BOGDANKA
A material aspect of the operations conducted by the Group is the necessity to secure future extraction possibilities by providing access to new coal resources.
If the activities leading to obtaining and extraction of new deposits are restricted or discontinued, or if unforeseen formal, legal or technical difficulties occur during the period of preparing the deposit for the extraction, the mining capacity could be limited, which in consequence may shorten the life of the mining plant and/or reduce the assumed level of extraction of hard coal thus decreasing future financial results of the LW BOGDANKA Group. At the moment the Group is undertaking activities with the aim of obtaining new licences in order to double its resources and secure a raw material base for extraction until 2050.
Recently we have noted growing interest on the part of domestic (Kompania Wglowa S.A.) and international business entities in the coal deposits in the Lublin Coal Basin. Some of those entities have been granted a licence to conduct prospecting and exploratory works in areas adjacent to LW BOGDANKA S.A. Consequently, these entities may in the future apply for mining licences. LW BOGDANKA S.A. holds a competitive advantage over prospec-
50

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
tive rivals in the form of extensive technical infrastructure necessary to conduct its operations, as well as unique know-how related to coal extraction in the mining and geological conditions of the Lublin Coal Basin deposit.
4.6.2.2 Technical and technological risk
Extracting coal from underground seams is a complex process which is subject to strict technical and technological requirements. During such operations, various stoppages can occur due to planned and unplanned technical interruptions (e.g. malfunctions). There is a potential risk associated with the effect of unplanned stoppages caused by serious malfunctions on the volume of production and sales and the possibility of punctually making deliveries to the customers of the LW BOGDANKA Group, and therefore on the financial results achieved by it in the future. The Group stresses that the risk of stoppages occurring in hard coal extraction operations is minimised by the fact that the mine uses the longwall system and currently extracts coal from four operating and one reequipped mining faces, which operate simultaneously. At the target production capacity, however, coal is obtained from four operating and two reequipped mining faces operating simultaneously. Technical and technological mining conditions the planned level of extraction can be maintained if a periodic stoppage occurs at one of the faces by intensifying work on the other. What is more, the extension of the Stefanów Field and the start-up of a second mining shaft (mining and skip shaft 2.1 in Stefanów), which took place in September 2011, further reduced the risk of a technological stoppage by ensuring the continuity of hard coal extraction if one of the shafts breaks down. Irrespective of the factors described above, the mine has a system of underground coal storage reservoirs. Three new reservoirs have recently been constructed in Stefanów. Raw coal reservoirs are also located on the surface. It should also be pointed out that advanced mining equipment and machines is used in mining operations and intensive research and development work aimed at increasing the productivity of operations is conducted, introducing solutions with a high degree of technical and technological reliability and increasing the safety of the work environment. These measures will significantly reduce the technical and technological risk.
In this group of risks, there is also the risk of unexpected, usually local, deterioration of the quality of the deposit, for example due to reduction of the thickness of the seam, uncovering waste rock concentrations or waviness of the seam, which will result in deterioration of the coal (an increase in amount of stone mined with the coal). In such a case, in spite of achievement of the full gross output and increased costs thereof (difficulties with mining the stone, greater wear of tools and means of transport, increased costs of processing and storage of stone, etc.), the amount of commercial coal obtained will be reduced, which will influence economic performance.
4.6.2.3 Risk associated with high costs of technologies applied by the Company
The technology of power coal extraction applied by LW BOGDANKA S.A. involves the use of highly specialised machines and equipment produced only by several producers in the world, and sometimes only by one, as is in the case of advanced powered longwall ploughing systems that enable reaching high extraction effectiveness in thin deposits.
As a result of the implemented investments referring to the Stefanów Field extension, it will be necessary to make further investments in new specialised mining machines. Due to global concentration of producers of the aforementioned machines and equipment, there is a risk of unexpected increase in prices of specialised machines and equipment, which could have impact on the increase of investment expenditures which must be borne in connection with implementation of the development strategy.
The longwall coal ploughing technology that the Company has been implementing for a few years allows highcapacity mining in thin coal deposits of as little as 1.2 metres (in 2010, the first longwall using this technology was put in operation). Such advanced solutions for mining industry are manufactured by only one company in the world. In 2012, LW BOGDANKA S.A. purchased the second longwall ploughing complex and in 2013 concluded an agreement for the delivery of the third one, to be performed in 2014. In addition to high costs of purchasing such equipment, there is a risk of difficulties in access (costs) to unique spare parts to ensure the operating continuity of the equipment, which may affect the costs of coal mining.
The risk of increased mining costs associated with the depth of mining will be growing. In 2015, mining of coal from seam 382 will end. Instead, mining of seam 391 will begin, which seam is located about 100 m below seam 382. As the depth increases, the difficulty of maintaining the workings (rock mass pressures increase), the natural temperature of rock, and some risks increase, which may result in an increase in coal mining costs.

4.6.2.4 Risk of IT systems malfunctioning
A partial or complete loss of data due to a malfunction of computer systems may adversely affect ongoing operations and therefore affect future financial results of the LW BOGDANKA Group. The Group systematically takes actions aimed at minimising the risk associated with the possibility of IT systems malfunctioning.
The Company implemented a "Policy for Safety of Information in the IT Systems of Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A." regulating organisational and technical measures for IT environment protection. This refers to the organisation of access to data, making safety copies and their storage, using the Internet traffic filters and firewall security systems, using application and hardware tools for the VPN secure connections, anti-virus systems for the purpose of protection servers and user workstations.
4.6.2.5 Key customer risk
Vast majority of the power coal produced by the LW BOGDANKA Group is sold to a relatively small group of large contracting parties operating on the domestic market. There is therefore a risk that the reduction or termination of cooperation with a key customer or the deterioration of the financial/economic situation of any of the main customers of the Company could have an adverse effect on the financial results.
As at the day of submitting the Report, the Group has signed contracts for the entire sales of coal for 2014, and has an agreement with Enea Wytwarzanie S.A. (Elektrownia Kozienice S.A.) which ensures a certain market for coal in the long-term perspective until 2025. In 2012, the Company signed new contracts with GDF Suez Energia Polska S.A. ­ (Elektrownia Polaniec) and with PGNiG Termika S.A. (formerly Vattenfall, Elektrocieplownie era and Siekierki in Warsaw), Oarów S.A. Group (Oarów and Rejowiec Cement Plants), and has stable contracts with Energa Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A., Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy S.A. and EDF Paliwa Sp. z o.o. (formerly Energokrak, supplies to EDF Elektrownia Rybnik S.A.), which guarantee supplies of power coal for the next five years.
Furthermore, the Company has concluded conditional agreements with Enea Elektrownia Kozienice S.A., Energa Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A. and Elektrownia Pólnoc Sp. z o.o. for the purposes of future power coal supplies to new power units which, once the conditions precedent are met, will guarantee sales of coal at least until 2036. The conditional nature of the agreements for the purposes of future power coal supplies to the new power units under construction means that they are contingent upon the successful closing of financing for the new power units, therefore there is a risk that some of those contracts may fall through and the Company might be forced to enter into talks with other coal buyers that will guarantee the sale of coal in the long-term perspective.
In connection with its conditional nature, the aforementioned agreement with Energa Elektrownie Ostrolka as regards future supplies for the newly constructed power unit C was terminated on 30 October 2012. The cause of termination, as given by the power plant, were changes in the market parameters of financing this investment and take-over of the Long-Term Investment Plan by the Energa Group, as a result of which the power unit C construction project was suspended and, therefore, the start date of power unit C operation, scheduled for 2016, will not be met. Termination of the agreement has no financial effect on the current situation, as the agreement related to a project of future supplies for which the Group assumes a high degree of risk related to failure to implement the project due to the requirement to ensure financing for the power unit C investment. The agreement is currently in the course of the 3 years' notice period. The terminated agreement does not apply to the current supplies to Energa Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A., which take place in accordance with the terms of a separate agreement.
The Group mitigates the risk of long-term contracts by analysing the situation on the coal supplies and energy market and the forecasts related thereto, as well as by co-operating with renowned institutions dealing with energy sources market analysis and by co-operating with first-rate law firms. Managing the risk of long-term contracts is aimed at reducing the degree to which the Group may be affected by the risk of disadvantageous situation in coal pricing in the market through appropriate stipulation of agreements that ensures stability of supplies for commercial power industry.
Information concerning significant trade agreements signed by the Group in 2013 and after the balance sheet date is provided in section 3.1 of the Report.
There is also a risk that energy investments in new capacities will not be implemented, or that energy investments will be inclined towards substitute sources of energy (atom, natural gas, shale gas, renewable sources of energy) or that investments will be significantly delayed ­ which may cause a problem regarding allocation of
52

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

significant volumes of coal originating from increased extraction. The Group mitigates this risk by looking for new customers who would diversify alternative sale options and would for example use the coal to mix it with imported or domestic coal from other producers.

There is also a potential risk that as a result of investment delays, the level of higher extraction will be achieved later than it is assumed in the investment, mining and coal sales plans. This may bring about a problem of performing under sales contracts for the needs of the key recipients, which are concluded well in advance, and a risk of incurring liquidated damages (if any) by the LW BOGDANKA Group. The Group mitigates this risk by flexible construction of trade contracts and ongoing co-operation with the key recipients.

4.6.2.6 Risk associated with competition by other power coal producers and the relatively low quality of the coal produced by the Company

On both the Polish market and export markets, the LW BOGDANKA Group is exposed to price competition from other producers of power coal in Poland (e.g. the mine companies Katowicki Holding Wglowy S.A. and Kompania Wglowa S.A.), as well as from eastern markets (including Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan) as well as supplies by other global producers delivered by sea (from the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp). In the case of domestic coal companies, significant risk factors associated with competition are:



consolidation processes in the mining and power industry (vertical and horizontal consolidation within

large energy groups) leading to the creation of powerful entities in terms of capital which determine how

the domestic power coal market will develop;



restructuring processes leading to the functional separation of entities responsible for generating energy,

selling energy or purchasing coal as part of energy holdings;



government assistance for hard coal mines in the Silesia region covered by a restructuring programme;



large volumes in stock held by competitive coal producers and by electricity producers;



poor financial standing of competitive coal producers; and



the resulting sales strategy of the competitors that focuses on maintaining a healthy cash flow rather

than on profitability.

In the case of coal suppliers from eastern markets, the LW BOGDANKA Group has a significant logistics advantage. In comparison to Polish producers of hard coal, its competitive strengths minimise the risk associated with price competition.

Another significant risk factor associated with competition are the less favourable quality parameters of the coal compared to the hard coal mined in the Silesia region (its lower calorific value and higher sulphur content), which limits the range of applications of the coal extracted in the LW BOGDANKA Group to industry and power production and forces the customers to invest in fume desulphurisation installations. Because customers for power coal have technologies which are prepared for burning coal with a particular calorific value and because, as at the date of submitting this Report, all the key customers have fume desulphurisation installations, the risk associated with the less favourable quality parameters of the produced coal is significantly limited.

The specific parameters of the coal produced by the Company provide it with a competitive advantage when supplying coal mainly to commercial power producers, whilst limiting however the possibility of selling to individual buyers due to the restricted capacity to produce thicker coal assortments.

4.6.2.7 Customer insolvency risk

Customer insolvency risk is associated with general level of current receivables of LW BOGDANKA payable by its customers and the surplus of Group's receivables in comparison to liabilities.

In order to protect against the risk of potential insolvency of its customers, the Group continuously monitors customers' arrears associated with making payments for the products sold (including for the main product - power coal), by analysing the credit risk for the main customers individually, or by the respective classes of assets. Moreover, as part of the credit risk management, the Group makes transactions solely with those customers whose creditworthiness has been confirmed. For many years the Company has cooperated on the basis of long-

53

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
term commercial contracts, as regards the delivery of power coal, with the main Polish energy-related groups, heat and power plants, heating plants and industrial enterprises.
4.6.2.8 Risk of delays in planned investments
The LW BOGDANKA Group is carrying out activities aiming at the increase of production capacities by extension of the Stefanów Field, the processing plant and the track system. Contracts for performance of those tasks were awarded through public procurements. In September 2011, lift mechanism of shaft 2.1 and facilities of the runof-mine haulage from shaft 2.1 to the Mechanical Coal Processing Plant in Bogdanka were launched. The LW BOGDANKA Group exercises due diligence in the actions taken to ensure that the extension of the Mechanical Coal Processing Plant is completed as soon as reasonably possible.
The main construction work was completed, however with respect to construction there still are ongoing minor finishing works. In 2014, machine and technology assembly works will be completed and commissioning procedures and test run of the plant will be started. In accordance with an annex to the agreement and agreements for additional works, the whole investment should be completed by the end of 31 August 2014. As a result, full coal beneficiation will be possible starting from when the extension of the mine is scheduled for completion. Before the investment in question is formally completed, the Company will continue to exploit coal deposits from the individual extraction fields (Bogdanka, Stefanów) in such a way so as to fully correlate the quality of the excavated output with the deadline for achieving full coal processing capacity by the Mechanical Coal Processing Plant. These actions are of great significance in terms of guaranteeing that the Company will meet its production and sales targets, as well as the quality parameters expected by the buyers and specified in the one-year and longterm contracts concluded with key energy sector customers.
4.6.2.9 Risk associated with the strong position of the trade unions in the Group
Trade unions hold a significant position in the hard coal mining sector and play an important role in determining staff and payroll policy, frequently forcing renegotiations of wage policy through protest actions. As at the day of submitting this Report, six trade union organisations operate at the Group, associating in total approx. 64% of its employees (four trade union organisations operate at LW BOGDANKA, associating 63% of the employees). The strong position of the trade unions creates a situation in which there is a risk of the costs of remuneration increasing under negotiated wage agreements in future, which could adversely affect the financial results of the LW BOGDANKA Group mainly. Furthermore, possible protests and/or strikes organised by the trade unions operating in the Company could affect the operating activities conducted by the LW BOGDANKA Group.
In the Group's opinion, cooperation of the Management Boards of the Parent and the Group's subsidiary with the trade unions operating in the Group has so far been successful. The Group's objectives include continuation of the cooperation between its Management Boards and the trade unions in order to maintain good mutual relations and increase the unions' involvement in achieving the companies' and the entire Group's objectives and strategy.
4.6.2.10 Risk associated with retaining and attracting human resources for LW BOGDANKA
The LW BOGDANKA Group's demand for human resources results from its strategy. The Group plans to recruit staff only for positions essential from the point of view of operating a coal mine, chiefly for mining, mechanical and electrical departments, and the Mechanical Coal Processing Plant, where, due to the work schedule of brigades/departments, it is impossible to complement the staffing by employees of external companies (e.g. RG Bogdanka).
So far the Group has experienced no major difficulties in attracting young and well-qualified personnel. The reactivated vocational training schemes discussed above essentially meet the Group's needs; therefore no risks have been identified in that area. Changes concerning the organisation of non-stationary vocational schooling (a system of courses), which were developed at the turn of 2011 and 2012, and will be introduced in the next school year, will not exert any influence on education, and thus, on the recruitment of new personnel.
A Company-independent factor which increases the risk of destabilisation of employment are the continued and protracted discussions and work of the government and the parliament on the pension system. While nothing negative has as yet been decided on miner pensions, announcements of returning to the case and the pressure from various social and political groups are conducive to the emergence of uncertainty. This regards extending the retirement age and reducing, or even revoking, the current pension benefits with respect to certain groups in the mining sector. The fear (perhaps unjustified) of losing certain accrued rights may, in case of unfavourable
54

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

course of events, lead to numerous retirements in a short period of time by people who have already acquired the so-called industry-specific rights, but would otherwise be willing to continue to work, putting their retirement off until a little later. These are especially valuable employees because of their knowledge and experience. Their value is high, both for the quality of work and for the process of training younger staff. Their sudden departure in a short period of time could disrupt the generational continuity, which is being rebuilt, and thus the mild gradual staff turnover.

4.6.2.11 Risk of the employees being additionally employed in external entities cooperating with the LW BOGDANKA Group

Such cooperation involves external entities providing outsourcing services to the LW BOGDANKA Group, whereby it provides workers to perform mining and maintenance/refurbishment work on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Because that work requires that people with appropriate qualifications and experience be employed, the people employed by the entities referred to above are mainly employees who work at the Company from Monday to Friday on the basis of an employment contract concluded directly with the Company.

If the provision of work for the LW BOGDANKA Group by the employees of the LW BOGDANKA Group through third-party entities could not be continued, the Company would be forced to hire additional employees or to reduce production, which could consequently have a negative effect on the financial results achieved by the LW BOGDANKA Group.

In 2013, the Company established EkoTrans Bogdanka (10 April 2013) and RG Bogdanka (11 September 2013), in order to improve its competitiveness with regard to outsourcing services rendered to LW BOGDANKA.

4.6.2.12 Key supplier risk

The specific nature of the LW BOGDANKA Group's operations requires applying technologies which often involve the use of highly specialised machinery and equipment as well as specialised services. Therefore there is a risk of problems occurring in identifying proper suppliers, as well as a risk of suppliers failing to meet their obligations under concluded agreements. This also applies to specialised providers of mining services, because due to a limited number of such providers on the Polish market, the Group may become dependent upon these entities.

The LW BOGDANKA Group, when signing agreements with suppliers, assesses possible threats for the contract performance and options for establishing cooperation with other suppliers. Furthermore, in order to secure the performance of "higher risk" contracts, the LW BOGDANKA Group requires that a performance bond is made.

4.6.2.13 Risk of unfavourable/inappropriate contractual terms being concluded

Due to the high degree of complexity of the agreements signed by the LW BOGDANKA Group (particularly those relating to the purchase of specialist equipment and technology), it is exposed to a risk of an agreement being concluded on unfavourable terms. This risk also occurs where a business partner has a very strong negotiating position (e.g. in the case of a contract for deliveries from the only manufacturer of a particular product). The Group is taking the following measures to minimise the probability of this risk occurring and its impact:



rigorous legal and substantive supervision of the process of concluding agreements resulting from tender

procedures according to the procedures of public tenders and others;



training in the logistics of concluding contracts and market analysis and training in negotiations and

trading, particularly at the international level.

4.6.3 Financial risk

4.6.3.1 Liquidity risk

Important factors in the assessment of insolvency risk include the level of operating cash flows generated by the company, the amount of cash, and liquidity ratios. In the case of the Group, cash at hand as at 31 December 2013 amounted to PLN 212,004,000. The current liquidity ratio for the Group amounted to 0.73, and quick liquidity ratio ­ 0.58. In the entire 2013 net flows from operating activities generated by the LW BOGDANKA Group were 9.88% higher (as compared to the previous year). Therefore, as at the day of submitting the Report, there is no risk of the insolvency. To avoid any potential risks in future and to mitigate the risk related to the Group's liquidity, long- and short-term analyses and forecasts are prepared, allowing cash needs to be determined. Those

55

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
activities make it possible to plan revenues and expenses in advance, and to determine optimal, from the point of view of the economic calculation, cash level and method of financing future expenses.
Furthermore, in order to optimise cash management, a public procurement procedure is currently pending in the Parent concerning the provision of a banking service involving the granting to the Company of an overdraft credit facility in PLN up to the amount of PLN 150 million.
4.6.3.2 Insurance risk
The Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA Group insures its business. As is the case with other mining enterprises in the world, the threats most significant in terms of risk assessment are those related to the possibility of damage to the property used for mining operations. In this respect the Company holds insurance policies covering such risks of loss and damage to underground property as: underground fire, explosion, rock burst, rock and gas outburst, underground flooding, with the highest compensation limit among Polish mining enterprises. The remaining Group's operations are covered by other insurance policies, such as third party liability insurance against damage caused in connection with business activity or property in the Group's possession, above-ground property insurance and all-risks insurance of rail vehicles. Given the very nature of insurance agreements which cover widestavailable and at the same time specified scopes of insurance, it is not possible to fully transfer the risk faced by the Group on insurance companies. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that insurance policies taken out by the Group will prove sufficient for covering each and every loss or liability, which may exert an influence on its financial standing, results of its operations and the generated cash flow.
4.6.4 Risks associated with environmental protection
4.6.4.1 Risk associated with reclamation and mining damage
The LW BOGDANKA Group is obliged to carry out reclamation of the post-mining land and remove mining damage. The existing standards of reclamation and mining damage removal may change in the future. It seems that given the current trends in environmental protection one may expect that the requirements regarding the postmining land reclamation and mining damage removal will be stricter. Any possible tightening of the standards in this respect may result in higher costs. As the mining area will be enlarged, the damage resulting from mining, both in buildings and agricultural land, will increase proportionately. Simultaneously with the coal extraction, the land settlement will enlarge within the mining area, which will result in a higher level of ground waters and local land undercuts. The growing damage resulting from mining will translate into higher outlays on the removal of the mining damage (purchase of developed real properties). Therefore, in addition to the existing recovery work, the Group will continue to protect buildings against the results of mining damage and to reimburse the costs incurred by investors on adjusting the new buildings under construction on the mining land to the current conditions. This may adversely affect the financial results of the Group.
The effects of extraction are monitored on an ongoing basis, including by way of gradual hydrographic works and prophylactic protection on the facilities within the boundaries of inflows.
4.6.4.2 Risk associated with tightening of standards and regulations of law with respect to environmental protection and the obligation to obtain permits for the economic use of the environment
The operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group have a significant impact on the environment. Given the nature of that impact, the Group must hold specific permits for the economic use of the environment and observe standards, detailed in applicable laws, of using the environment (including BAT requirements - Best Available Techniques), regarding in particular emissions of substances and noise to the air, water and waste management, management of the generated solid waste and the use of natural resources. As at the date of submitting the Report, the Group's operations are conducted in compliance with law and BAT requirements. The Group holds all permits required in connection with its operations, including, in particular, integrated permit for the installations covered with IPPS requirements (EkoKLINKIER Construction Ceramics Plant) and a permit for operating a mining waste utilisation facility. For the settlement period 2013÷2020, the Group was offered gratuitous CO2 emission allowance. Furthermore, it must be stressed that since the environmental law regulations are subject to continuous changes, and the prevailing last years' trends in the EC environmental laws lead to tightening the standards of environmental protection, it cannot be ruled out that in future further legislative changes will introduce even
56

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
stricter standards of the use of the environment which may apply to the LW BOGDANKA Group. The changes may lead to the necessity of adjusting the Group's operations to the new requirements (e.g. changes with respect to the use of technologies for improving the emissions to the air or the manner of waste management), as well as further changes as regards the terms and conditions of permits granted to LW BOGDANKA or to Lczyska Energetyka, which in consequence may lead to a necessity to incur investment outlays and hence adversely affect the financial results. In order to lower the risk related to the provisions of the amended Mining Waste Act, in 2012 LW BOGDANKA obtained a permit for operating a mining waste utilisation facility. Therefore, the operations in this respect have been adapted to the new regulatory requirements as from 1 May 2012.
In order to mitigate the risk related with the change in regulations with respect to the environment protection, the Group monitors on an ongoing basis, and adjusts its operations accordingly, within the prescribed time limits.
4.6.4.3 Risk associated with management of waste generated after extension of the mining area
In connection with the extension of the mining area and increased extraction of coal, the amount of generated extraction waste significantly increased (in 2013 at the level of 5.06 million tonnes per year; the forecast for the period after 2013 in connection with a further increase in extraction is that the amount of waste in 2014 will range between 5.2 and 5.7 million tonnes). As of 31 December 2013, approx. 37% of extraction waste was recycled, whereas the remaining part was neutralised at the waste yard on the mine's premises (the waste is recycled by the mine or passed on to the entities authorised to deal with waste management for the purpose of recycling). Since ­ according to estimates ­ the storage capacity of the waste yard is sufficient for the next 3-5 years of storing, the Group (on the basis of a building permit) commenced works connected with increasing the height of the existing yard to 250 MASL, and undertook measures aimed at acquiring the adjacent areas in order to further extend the facility (increasing the area by approx. 144 ha to approx. 230 ha). The multi-stage investment requires amendment of the local spatial development plan of the commune (conversion of farmland and forest area into land for waste storage purposes), while the investment process itself will require endorsements, as well as decisions and permits for construction and exploitation of the environment. What is more, as approx. 90% of land is owned by individual farmers, the mine will be forced to purchase those plots. Applications were submitted requesting that relevant amendments be made to the local spatial development plan. Considerable advancement has been made in this respect. Following social consultations, local community expressed its approval for the investment. Moreover, talks with the plot owners were already held, and preliminary consents for the purchase of plots were obtained. Nevertheless, taking into account the factors connected with the investment process referred to above, one cannot exclude the risk that the planned investment would not be implemented. Failure to implement this investment will mean the risk of disrupting the stability of the extraction process and the necessity to search for alternative ways to manage the extraction waste. There is a risk that other solutions (in particular passing the waste to other entities for management, other waste yard location) may turn to be less cost effective which may affect the financial result.
In order to limit the risk related to acquiring waste utilisation sites, works connected with increasing the height of the existing mining waste utilisation facility were commenced. Such course of action will make it possible, without undue haste, to continue the work on acquiring new land to execute the next phases of extension of the yard and handle any formal and legal issues connected with this project.
4.6.4.4 Investment risks associated with protected areas
The mine is located in the vicinity of protected areas (a national park, landscape parks, protected landscape areas, ecological channel and two areas subject to Nature 2000 network regulations located partially on the area of the mining land and three others in close vicinity of the mining land). Those environmental conditions do not pose an obstacle for the activity in its present scope. Nevertheless, all the planned investment activities must be analysed from the perspective of their potential negative impact on protected areas.
According to the law, business activity which has negative impact on the environment of the protected areas (and in their vicinity) may be significantly limited. During the proceedings aiming to issue investment decisions, a competent administrative authority examines the environmental impact of the investment by analysing the description, characteristics, technical and project data of a given investment. Should the authority find it necessary, it may impose certain obligations on the investor in order to eliminate the negative impact. Therefore, if a planned investment is located in the zone of impact on protected areas, the investor must take into account the
57

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
possibility that it may be encumbered with certain obligations, which in practice usually means the necessity of additional investment expenditures.
There is a risk that in the case of investment activities, certain obligations may be imposed or the requirements concerning the limitation of the negative environmental impact may be stricter (e.g. an obligation to introduce certain technological solutions with respect to water and sewage management in connection with the impact on the ground water environment and the risk of negative changes in the ground water levels). These investment restrictions may require higher investment costs and therefore may affect the financial result.
4.6.5 Risk associated with proceedings and legal environment
4.6.5.1 Risk of change to tax laws
The lack of stability and transparency of the Polish tax system, resulting from constant changes to the laws in force and incoherent interpretation of the tax law, may cause uncertainty with regard to the end result of the financial decisions. Regular amendments to tax regulations and rigorous curative provisions do not offer an incentive for decision-making. Legislative changes may generate all kinds of risks. Tax returns submitted by the Company may subject to inspection of fiscal authorities which, in the event of any irregularities, may calculate tax arrears including interest. Submitted tax returns may be reviewed by fiscal authorities for the period of five years and some transactions carried out in that period, including transactions carried out within the Group as transactions of related entities, may be questioned for tax purposes by competent tax authorities. As a result, the amounts disclosed in the financial statements may be changed at a later date, when they are determined in a final way by fiscal authorities.
4.6.5.2 Risk of real estate tax on mining excavations of LW BOGDANKA
In accordance with the strategy of Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A., the value of underground workings and the infrastructure located in these workings have not been included in its real property tax returns for tax assessment purposes.
In 2013 fiscal proceedings were pending against the Company in order to determine the amount of real property tax due for the period between 2004 and 2012, instigated by the Heads of Puchaczów, Cyców and Ludwin communes.
In their decisions specifying the amount of real property tax due from the Company with regard to the period between 2003 and 2007, the authorities of the first instance determined that real property tax shall also apply to underground mining workings, including the infrastructure located within those workings. However, the decisions specifying the amount of real property tax due from the Company for 2008, issued both by the authorities of the first instance and the authority of the second instance [Local Government Appellate Court in Lublin], determined that real property tax was only due for the following infrastructure components located in underground mining workings: pipelines, slackline cableway routes and floor-mounted railways, which means that the real property tax base fails to include the value of underground mining workings in terms of the cost of their drilling. The decisions issued by the Local Government Appellate Court regarding the real property tax due for 2008 were challenged by the Company in full and submitted for a ruling to the Provincial Administrative Court in Lublin.
The position of fiscal authorities stated in their decisions concerning the real property tax for 2008 clearly reflects the unequivocal position of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal expressed in its ruling of 13 September 2011 in Case No. P 33/09 and the subsequent position of administrative courts based thereon. In the ruling referred to above the Constitutional Tribunal found that under the applicable provisions of law, imposing real property tax on the value of underground workings is, from the constitutional perspective, unacceptable. Underground workings are not building facilities (building equipment) within the meaning of the Polish Building Law, but space created as a result of mining and, in consequence, may not be classified as structures within the meaning of the Polish Building Law. Therefore, underground workings are not subject to real property tax either separately (i.e. as workings in the physical sense), or in combination with the infrastructure located in them (i.e. as workings defined comprehensively).
The position expressed in the above ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal and the related position of administrative courts questions the possibility to calculate real property tax on the value of underground workings in terms of the cost of their drilling. At the same time, the Constitutional Tribunal did not rule out the possibility of charging real property tax on structures and building equipment located in underground mining workings, with the
58

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
proviso that real property tax on such structures and equipment could only be imposed if certain conditions, specified in detail in the ruling, were met.
Taking into account the position of the Tribunal expressed in the ruling referred to above and the position expressed by the fiscal authorities (Heads of communes and the Local Government Appellate Court in Lublin) in their decisions regarding the Company's real property tax liabilities for 2008 it should be stated that if this position prevails in the future, the risk of negative financial consequences related to the pending real property tax proceedings has been significantly reduced compared to the scale of repercussions resulting from the decisions of the authorities of the first instance concerning the real property tax for the period between 2003 and 2007.
4.6.5.3 Risk associated with expenses for creating certain mining pits and their classification for the purposes of corporate income tax
Classification of mining pits in accounting books of hard coal mines is carried out on the basis of the purpose of particular pits. The created pits are recorded in the accounting books as non-current assets or directly as operating costs and the point when such costs are incurred. The pits comprising a fixed underground mine infrastructure are classified as non-current assets. The exploitation and movement pits are classified as operating costs at the time when such costs are incurred ­ cost pits. They include the following pits:
a. preparatory pits for liquidation ­ when the excavation from the exploitation field the preparatory pits are associated with ends, those pits are liquidated as useless for the remaining parts of the mine. Some of those pits which perform the function of near-wall pits are liquidated gradually along the progress of the exploited panel. The classification of this group of pits for liquidation is determined at the stage of planning the method of preparing the deposits for exploitation;
b. special pits of auxiliary nature - created from pits localised on exploitation fields (blasting niches, drill niches, section chambers ). They are liquidated with other movement pits for which the operation has already been performed;
c. selector pits ­ they are used for deposit extraction (panels and cross-cuts). Those pits are liquidated when the extraction in the field of the panel is completed and when they are no longer necessary for operation of the remaining parts of the mine;
d. pits and examination holes ­ corridor pits and openings performed from the surface and mining pits for the purposes of examination of the deposit. The purpose of those pits is to examine the deposit structure and collect information on its exploitation.
Some of the cost pits referred to above were performed earlier than 1 year ago. In the light of the current tax laws, one cannot exclude a possibility of another qualification of this type of costs for the purposes of corporate persons income tax than the one performed, which could potentially mean decreasing the cost base for tax purposes in past and current settlements of the income tax and a potential payment of additional amounts of the tax. The mining companies have made an attempt to clarify this issue ­ they suggest changes and clarification of the classification rules concerning this aspect of Non-Current Assets Classification. http://www.lw.com.pl
4.6.5.4 Risk of a change in the law and its interpretation and application
The lack of stability and transparency of the Polish tax system, resulting from constant changes to the laws in force and incoherent interpretation of the tax law, may cause uncertainty with regard to the end result of the financial decisions. Regular amendments to tax regulations and rigorous curative provisions do not offer an incentive for decision-making. Legislative changes may generate all kinds of risks. Any tax rulings issued following the stock exchange debut may tarnish the Group's image and goodwill. Submitted tax returns may subject to inspection of fiscal authorities which, in the event of any irregularities, may calculate tax arrears including interest. Tax returns submitted by the Group companies may be reviewed by fiscal authorities for the period of five years and some transactions carried out in that period, including transactions carried out within the Group as transactions of related entities, may be questioned for tax purposes by competent tax authorities.
As a result, the amounts disclosed in the financial statements may be changed at a later date, when they are determined in a final way by fiscal authorities. In order to limit this type of risk, the Group applies various tax optimisation and tax planning methods, consequently limiting to a large extent the impact of such potential adverse events on the operations and financial performance of individual companies within the group.

4.6.5.5 Risk of violating the stock exchange disclosure requirements
Since LW BOGDANKA S.A. is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Group is subject to provisions which impose a number of requirements connected, inter alia, with securing equal access to certain information on the Group's activity to all investors, publication of such information in a manner specified in the law and strictly specified rules of dealing with confidential information, in compliance with the Act on public offering and conditions for introducing financial instruments to organised system of trade and on public companies (uniform text, Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] 09.185.1439, uniform text). For failure to perform or undue performance of the requirements set forth above a very high fine may be imposed. The Company makes efforts to mitigate this risk by meeting its obligations in a reliable way, which was preceded by implementation of internal procedures specifying the circulation of stock exchange information at LW BOGDANKA S.A. and by permanent monitoring of the companies' activity from the perspective of disclosure requirements.
4.6.6 Integrated system of enterprise risk management -- a summary
Following leading corporate benchmarks with respect to the fulfilment of the best international practices, the Company's obligations and activities supporting corporate governance, in 2011 LW BOGDANKA S.A. introduced the Integrated System of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). In 2012, an IT (Risk Manager) system was implemented to support the enterprise risk management system, and the basic documents setting out the rules of system functioning, such as policies, procedures, risk register and risk valuation principles, were modified to adapt them to the implemented software. Currently, the risk management system of the Company covers all areas of the business and is aimed at identifying potential risks and opportunities for the enterprise. Risks are identified by Risk Owners (persons holding managerial positions in the organization), who then valuate them in accordance with predetermined scales of probability and potential impact of risk materialisation in five areas. Risks that received a total score in excess of a certain value are considered strategic risks ­ significant for the Company's business. For those risks, actions/plans aimed at minimising them and mitigating the possible effects of their occurrence are established and accepted by the Management Board. An important role in the risk management system of the Company is played by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee appointed by the Management Board, which Committee has its own specific competences at every stage of ERM operation, and which performs functions that involve accepting and issuing opinions on any identified risks and mitigation measures.
The Company presents information and reports on the results of ERM implementation and operation to the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. In subsequent periods, work is planned to further adapt the system to the needs of the Company to increase its role and effectiveness, based on the experience and performance of the system to date.

7 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
7.1 Measures undertaken by LW BOGDANKA S.A. in connection with environmental protection
7.1.1 Location of the Company
The entire infrastructure of the mine and the "Puchaczów V" mining area are surrounded with protected land. In the immediate vicinity the Polesie National Park and Lczna Lake District Landscape Park are located. In the north-east, the mining area overlaps with small stretches of the protection zone of the aforementioned landscape park which have been included in the Nature 2000 site ­ "Jeziora Uciwierskie" (Uciwierskie Lakes) (CODE PLH 060009). The region is also part of the "International Biosphere Reserve ­ Polesie Zachodnie" area, which surrounds the Mining Area from the north and west.
The Polesie Protected Landscape Area is located in the north-west, while in the south-east there is the Chelm Protected Landscape Area.
The mine does not present an ecological threat in terms of environmental impact. That is due to the Company's long-term pro-environmental actions, implementation of an Integrated Quality, Environmental and Health and Safety Management System, and obtaining a relevant certificate in accordance with PN EN ISO 14001, 9001 and 18001.
7.1.2 Natural environment protection measures
Air protection
LW BOGDANKA has an organised emitter which emits dust and gas into the atmosphere. It is the Construction Ceramics Plant where the main source of gas and dust emissions include: brick tunnel kiln, and ground material preparation unit. The EkoKLINKIER Construction Ceramics Production Branch has an integrated permit no. PZ 17/2006 of 29 December 2006, which specifies, among other things, the conditions and permissible amounts of pollutants which may be emitted from the plant into the air. The permit was amended by virtue of decision PZ 21/2009 of 6 July 2009 and decision No. 2/2012 of 31 January 2012. In 2012, the EkoKLINKIER Construction Ceramics Production Branch emitted 2,960 Mg of dust and gas without violating the permit. In accordance with the applicable laws, environmental charges for air emissions from the Construction Ceramics Plant were charged and paid at the end of the calendar year.
The Construction Ceramics Plant is included in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and, pursuant to the National Allocation Plan, the plant received 12,049 Mg of CO2 per annum in the 2nd trading period 2008÷2012. The proposed allocation to the Plant for the trading period 2013÷2020 is 10,700 Mg of CO2 per annum. The report for 2013 on CO2 emissions will, upon verification by an authorised company, be sent to the National System Administrator ­ Institute of Environmental Protection. Time limit stipulated by the law -- the end of the 1st quarter after the end of the trading year.
The second emitter is the waste rock disposal area, which may be a source of dust on dry and windy days.
7.1.3 Water and sewage management
Water and sewage management in terms of mine water involves:
 rock mass drainage at working sites,
 controlled drainage of Jurassic layers (limited amounts due to safety and technical issues),  use of water for fire and process purposes (air-conditioning, machinery cooling, fighting dust risk),
65

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
 pumping water to the surface,
 use of mine water on the surface (Mechanical Coal Processing Plant, Lczyska Energetyka Sp. z o.o.),
 retention of mine water in surface tanks in order to reduce suspension,
 discharge of water from tanks through the Rów elazny ditch into the winka River.
In 2013, the average annual water supply to workings amounted to 6,203,677 m3, average total mineralisation 2,411.91 mg/dm3, Cl + SO4 ion content ­ 997 mg/dm3. The Cl + SO4 ion content classifies the mine water of Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. into category II of industrial water (in accordance with the Central Mining Institute (Glówny Instytut Górnictwa) classification) ­ as was the case in previous years.
The quantity of mine water used in 2013 for industrial purposes underground and on the surface amounted to a total of approx. 13,157 m3/day, out of which approx. 11,582 m3/day was used underground for the purpose of supplying the fire-fighting system and climatic systems. On the surface, water was used primarily by the Mechanical Coal Processing Plant in the quantity of 1,547 m3/day for process purposes (water supplementation in closed circulatory system) and by Lczyska Energetyka ­ 28 m3/day.
Tests of physicochemical properties of mine water are conducted on a regular basis, once a year, by Pomiar ­ GIG Lublin. In 2013, as was the case in previous years, 35 samples were taken for the purpose of physicochemical analyses of mine water which reaches the workings.
In 2013, tests of radioactive substances in mine water were conducted by the Radiometry Laboratory of the Central Mining Institute (Glówny Instytut Górnictwa), and revealed the following concentrations: Radium 226 in the range of < 0.01 ­ 0.09 KBq/m3, Radium 228 < 0.07 - 0.12 KBq/m3. In the last 10 years, the results of water radioactivity analyses have been stable and show values significantly below the permissible norms.
The Company holds an administrative decision ­ water permit for special water use in accordance with its operations. It is decision no. iR.III.6811/91/07 of 31 December 2007, valid until 31 December 2017, concerning:
a) drainage of the LW BOGDANKA S.A. mine in Bogdanka in quantities which shall not exceed:
Qdavg = 20,000 m3 /d, Qmax = 22,000 m3/d,
Qhmax = 917 m3 /h, until 31 December 2010, and
Qdavg = 26,700 m3 /d, Qmax = 32 000 m3/d,
Qhmax = 1,400 m3 /h, from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2017.
b) discharge of unused mine water from the sedimentation tank through the discharge ditch into the "elazny" ditch, which is a tributary of the winka River.
In 2013, 15,422 m3/day of water from mine drainage was discharged into the river. Mine water discharged into the surface water ­ the winka River ­ exceeds the parameters specified for category II of water quality only in terms of chloride content (on average 970.84 mg/dm3).
Basic indicators of pollutants in the discharged water do not exceed the values specified in the water permit decision.
Drinking water and water for household purposes is supplied to Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. from the water mains of "Lczyska Energetyka" Sp. z o.o., which holds valid water permit decisions for:
 water intake and groundwater extraction in Bogdanka, Nadrybie and Stefanów,
 discharge of treated sewage,
 use of sewage treatment equipment.
Documentation maintained by "Lczyska Energetyka" Sp. z o.o. confirms compliance with the conditions specified in the decisions.
Pursuant to legal requirements, twice a year ­ after the end of each calendar year, LW BOGDANKA calculated and paid a charge for Cl + SO4 load in unused mine water discharged into the receiving water body ­ the winka River.

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
In 2013, in compliance with the water permit, routine maintenance of the perimeter ditch of the dumpsite and the "elazny" drainage ditch which discharges mine water into the winka River was conducted.
7.1.4 Surface protection
In 2013, the impact of mining on the surface ­ as to date ­ manifested itself mainly as an increase in the surface scope of impact, with the following maximum soil settlement values in the following regions:
- approx. 2.50 m in the area of the former ZRH (Agriculture and Stock Farm) in Puchaczów, and in the area of such villages as Kobylki-Kolonia Szczecin, Nadrybie Dwór, Nadrybie Ukazowe and to the east of the buildings in the Dratów village,
- approx. 2.00 m in the area of the village of Uciekajka and western part of the village of Kaniwola,
- approx. 2.00 m east of Puchaczów (near the course of the side-track),
- approx. 0.30 m south of the mining area (in the area of 7/VII ploughing panel exploitation).
In the area of the village of Bogdanka I and Nadrybie Wie (extension of Bogdanka I) ­ after mining two seams ­ maximum soil settlement remains at the same level and amounts to approx. 5.00 m in the central part of the settlement basin.
Damage to buildings in 2013 ­ as to date ­ were primarily related to rural buildings, i.e. small-size residential and farm buildings. The reported damage to those buildings did not constitute a threat to their users and were removed immediately; also, protection against further impact was provided. In total, damage was removed and protection was provided in 17 buildings (in 10 residential and 7 farm ones).
In 2013, the buy-out of the developed properties that were affected most with the negative effects of mining exploitation, which started in 2010, was continued. In order to repair unremovable damage caused by mining in 2013 another three properties located in the Puchaczów commune were bought together with buildings situated on these properties.
As part of mining damage repair, dressing of damaged asphalt roads and dirt roads was carried out (in sections of commune and district roads) within a total distance of approx. 6.2 km.
Damage to farmland in 2013 manifested itself ­ as was the case in previous years ­ as persisting permeation of land, with the areas of permeation of land gradually becoming larger in the following regions:
- the area east of the village of Dratów, i.e. in the area where faces 10/I, 9/I, 8/I and 7/I in seam 382 are mined,
- the area west of the villages of Kaniwola and Nadrybie Ukazowe, i.e. in the area of previous mining of faces 6/II, 7/II and 8/II in seam 382,
- the area of the villages of Uciekajka and Kobylki, i.e. after mining faces 10/II, 11/II and 12/II in seam 382.
- in the area of the railway line east of Puchaczów, i.e. in the area where faces 1/IV, 2/IV, 3/IV and 4/IV in seam 385 are mined.
The affected land owners in this area received suitable compensation for lost profits from the land affected by permeation in the total amount of PLN 2.6 million.
The costs of removing damage caused by mining in 2013 amounted to a total of approx. PLN 7.5 million. Total expenditure incurred in 2013 in connection with removing damage caused by mining increased in relation to the expenditure incurred in 2012, which amounted to approx. PLN 5.2 million.
In 2013, supplementary water engineering works connected with controlling hydrographic conditions in the area of the villages of Kobylki were continued.
Reclamation
In 2013, Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. did not conduct land reclamation works in post-industrial areas, however it regularly nurtured the greenery, and took care of the facility used as the mining waste dump, and previously remediated post-industrial land in the area of the Bogdanka, Nadrybie and Stefanów Fields, and railway facilities in Zawadów.

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

In 2014 and in the years to follow, it is forecast that another developed farming plots in the Puchaczów and Ludwin communes will be bought back, due to irreparable to-date and forecast further damages caused by mining exploitation processes (i.e. permanent continuous undercuts). In 2014 about 8 developed real properties are planned to be purchased (applications in this regard were submitted in 2012 and 2013).
As a part of removing mining damage, in 2014 it is also planned:
- replacement of several overhead power lines with cable power lines, and replacement of some power lines with isolated networks.
Due to further exploitation, and thus ground settling (about 2.0m - exploitation of panels No. 1/IV/385, 2/IV/385, 3/IV/385 and 4/IV/385), there were local floodlands in the area of the mining water outflow ditch which prevented gravitational outflow of the mining water. After performance of hydro works in previous years, this area is being monitored regularly in order to prevent possible obstructions in outflow of this water to the winka river.
Waste management
In 2013, the total mining waste amounted to 5,064,500 tonnes. Approximately 37% of the waste was recovered and reused.
Waste recovery for industrial purposes in the installation of EkoKLINKIER Construction Ceramics production amounted to a total of 18,152 tonnes of waste.
Waste recovery for non-industrial purposes (i.e. remediation of post-mining areas, using waste to strengthen roads, yards, and for other purposes) amounted to 1,846,421 tonnes.
Mining waste is mostly (approx. 99% of all managed waste) used for the purpose of rehabilitation of degraded land (different types of post-mining pits). It involves restoration of the original lay of the land by filling pits with mining waste, and then covering them with a layer of soil, and using for agricultural purposes or forestation. That takes place in accordance with the "Program of Mineral Resources Post-Mining Pit Remediation in the Territory of the Lublin Province" developed by the Environmental Protection Department of the Province Governor's Office in Lublin and approved by the Lublin Province Governor.
Owners of remediated land hold appropriate decisions of environmental protection authorities (district governor's office).
The table below shows dynamic quantities of waste obtained, waste recovered, and waste treated by depositing it in the facility used as the mining waste dump ­ in accordance with the Act on waste (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] No. 62, item 628, 2001, as amended).

In 2013, the Company did not pay for waste storage, which is in line with the new Act on mining waste of 10 July 2008 (Article 26.3) (consolidated text, Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] of 2013, item 1136).

Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. obtained a decision of the Lublin Province Governor no. SiR VII. 6620/32/2004 of 10 September 2004, as amended, permitting the production, recovery and treatment of waste, including a specification of the manner of waste management. The decision ­ in accordance with the applicable legislation ­ is applicable to all waste generated by the mine.

In 2013, pursuant to I.10.4. of the integrated permit, tests of the physicochemical composition of waste rock were carried out, and they will be carried out on a regular basis, annually, in accordance with the aforementioned permit.

To date, analyses of Carboniferous waste rock carried out by "Pomiar-GIG" have demonstrated stability of the physicochemical properties of that waste and showed their suitability for, among other things, engineering works

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
Concurrently, due to the decrease in production, the emissions fee for the boiler house in Bogdanka went down by approximately 16%. The opposite was true of the boiler house in Zawadów, where the emissions fee for the same period increased by 32%. The rise in the fees for the use of the environment in terms of water intake and wastewater discharge (by nearly 39%) was the direct consequence of the increase in underground water extraction and in the volume of wastewater discharged (in particular from the Nadrybie and Stefanów Fields). In the past financial year, as in previous years, no fines for exceeding set emission limits were imposed on the Company. The volume of CO2 emissions amounted to 48,583 Mg, the limit granted for 2013 stands at 29 440 Mg (not yet approved).

9.2 Resolution on the issue of series A subscription warrants with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right, conditional increase in the Company's share capital with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right, consent to carry out the Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017
On 4 July 2013, the Annual General Shareholders Meeting of Lubelski Wgiel Bogdanka S.A. adopted Resolution No. 26 on the issue of up to 1,360,540 (one million three hundred and sixty thousand five hundred and forty) registered series A subscription warrants ("Warrants") with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right, a conditional increase in the Company's share capital by not more than PLN 6,802,700 (six million eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred zlotys) by issuing not more than 1,360,540 (one million three hundred and sixty thousand five hundred and forty) ordinary bearer series D shares with a nominal value of PLN 5.00 (five zlotys) each ("Series D Shares") with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right. Each Warrant will carry the right to acquire one Series D Share. The Warrants will be offered to the members of the Company's Management Board and to senior management members of key importance for the Company's development, i.e. to employees of the Company and of its subsidiaries as named in a list prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board ("Eligible Persons"), as a result of exercising the options granted by the Company's Supervisory Board ("Options") as part of the Management Options Scheme in place at the Company in 2013÷2018 ("Scheme"). The Warrants are to be issued free of charge, which is justified by the nature of the issue.
The issue of Series D Shares, in accordance with the assumptions of the Scheme, will be equal to their nominal value, i.e. PLN 5.00 (five zlotys) per share. The right to acquire Warrants free of charge and the right to acquire Series D Shares at their issue price equal to their nominal value will act as an incentive for the Eligible Persons. This, in turn, will allow for aligning the personal interests of the Eligible Persons with the interests of the Company and, therefore, contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the Eligible Persons' measures aimed at improving the Company's financial results.
The Company notified about the Scheme in Current Report No. 18/2013 of 29 May 2013 and Current Report No. 27/2013 of 5 July 2013.
9.3 Adoption of Terms and Conditions of Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017 by the Supervisory Board and allocation of the options
By virtue of a Resolution of 30 September 2013 the Supervisory Board adopted the Terms and Conditions of the Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017 (the "Scheme"). The Resolution was adopted on the basis of Resolution No. 26 of the Annual General Shareholders Meeting of Lubelski Wgiel Bogdanka S.A. of 4 July 2013 on the issue of series A subscription warrants with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right, conditional increase in the Company's share capital with the exclusion of a pre-emptive right, consent to carry out the Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017, which was announced by the Company in Current Report No. 27/2013 of 5 July 2013.
By virtue of the Resolution of 30 September 2013 and as part of the Scheme, the Supervisory Board allocated a total of 1,102,032 Options for 2013÷2017. Members of the Management Board were allocated the Options as follows: Zbigniew Stopa, President of the Management Board, received 183,672 Options, each of the remaining Members of the Management Board, i.e. Waldemar Bernaciak, Roger de Bazelaire and Krzysztof Szlaga received 122,448 Options. The remaining 551,016 Options were allocated to senior management members of key importance for the Company's development.
Options carry the right for eligible persons to acquire series A warrants free of charge. The warrants, in turn, carry the right to acquire series D shares.
The base price is equal to the average price of shares in the Company (calculated based on the closing prices of shares) for the three months preceding the date on which the General Shareholders Meeting adopted the Resolution, i.e. 4 July 2013 and amounts to PLN 117.75.
In each subsequent calendar month the base price is indexed by 0.35%, with the first date of base price indexation being 1 August 2013, and thereafter the date of indexation being the first day of each subsequent month.
The Strike Price of Options is equal to the base price less the cumulative dividend paid by the Company from the date of exercising the Options calculated for one share, starting from the dividend for 2012.
The exercise of the allocated Options will be conditional upon the fulfilment of business criteria in line with the Company's strategic plans, in accordance with parameters defined in Resolution No. 26 the Annual General
73

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
Shareholders Meeting on 4 July 2013 and the Terms and Conditions of Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017 and the resolution regarding the business criteria which, if met, may trigger the exercise of Options in the Management Options Scheme adopted by the Supervisory Board on 30 September 2013.
The exercise of the allocated Options will be conditional upon the satisfaction of EPS and UCCPr criteria, which will entitle the Participants to the exercise of 50% of available Options in each case.
In each year of the Scheme, the Supervisory Board shall adopt a resolution confirming satisfaction of (or failure to satisfy) the conditions entitling to the exercise of Options at a meeting held to assess the Company's financial statements for the previous financial year.
Within three years from the date of adopting resolution confirming satisfaction of the conditions, Participants may decide to exercise Options four times a year, within 10 business days after an interim report is published, except in lock-up periods. Following the exercise of the Options, half of the Warrants will be kept in the mandatory Loyalty Portfolio, with limited possibilities to convert them into shares and sell.
Number of Subscription Warrants a Participant may take up is determined as the quotient of the Option intrinsic value as at the Option exercise date (calculated as (market price of shares as at the Option exercise date less strike price) x number of Options) and the market price of shares as at the Option exercise date (Option intrinsic value/market price of the Company's shares). The Participant will be entitled to acquire the Company shares in the number equivalent to the number of warrants held.
Detailed information regarding the Scheme, including the Terms and Conditions of Management Options Scheme in 2013÷2017 was provided in Current Report No. 35/2013 of 30 September 2013.

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013
Execution of the 2013 advertising budget
Promotional activities for the BOGDANKA corporate brand focused on:
1) the product and on the brand image ­ from June to September 2013 the Company ran an advertising and educational campaign whose slogan read "Don't wait too long, don't pay too much ­ buy now", with the aim of raising customer awareness of the benefits associated with purchasing coal ahead of the start of the heating season. The campaign also promoted the benefits of using coal for heating purposes, but focused primarily on environmental factors related to the burning of dry coal in modern heating systems. The campaign generated greater demand for Bogdanka coal already in early autumn among individual buyers, but also small-sized enterprises.
2) the brand image -- these activities were conducted, first and foremost, in the Lublin region, as well as at nationwide events addressed to the mining and power engineering sectors. In both cases the Company's advertising was aimed at fostering a positive corporate image of the Company as a large, innovative and expansive business (building the success dimension of the brand), as well as a reliable employer, which, while achieving market success, remains sensitive to the problems of the people, region and the environment in which it operates [building the social dimension of the brand]. The fundamental PR operations conducted in 2013 concerned mainly the press media market. The objective of PR activities was to develop desirable positive attitudes towards the Company among decision- and opinion-making bodies in connection with the Company's presence on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and to build a positive image in the eyes of the existing and future shareholders.
Advertising at cultural and scientific events greatly contributed to the creation of positive brand image in the community, as well as among researchers, decision- and opinion makers and emphasised the importance of Lubelski Wgiel BOGDANKA S.A. for the Lublin region as one of few large and expansive companies in the area.
The promotional activities involved mainly displaying the logos of brands belonging to LW BOGDANKA S.A. at events considered important for the region and the corporate brand from the point of view of advertising and target groups. Information about the range of products offered by the Company was actively distributed at cultural, educational and other events.
The advertising activities listed above had a significant impact on the promotion of the BOGDANKA brand. Radio and television broadcasts of sports tournaments and sponsored social or sports events, articles about sports teams sponsored by the Company and their photographs published in the press demonstrated the Company's commitment to the promotion of sports and an active lifestyle. All these activities were aimed at promoting the Company's Corporate Identity ­ domestic and international success, good relations with the general public, earning the trust of the Company's stakeholders.
In conclusion, the sponsorship of sports clubs, in particular GKS Bogdanka / Górnik Lczna and Lubelski Wgiel KM Lublin, as well as the purchase of advertising in nationwide media, promoted the BOGDANKA brand all over Poland. Advertising activities at various conferences, conventions and trade meetings fostered a positive image of LW BOGDANKA S.A. brands among decision-makers, scientists and entrepreneurs representing the Lublin region, as well as the whole country. Advertising at cultural and social events proved to be an excellent means of building a positive image of the Company among private customers, greatly enhancing the social dimension of the brand in the region. The promotion of the corporate and associated brands was strengthened by the success of sports clubs sponsored through advertising, as well as by advertisements shown at sports events or tournaments involving other clubs, with whom promotional co-operation had been established.
Execution of promotional budgets
The implementation of the advertising budgets both of the Bogdanka corporate brand and the associated EkoKLINKIER brand stood at 94.89% and 66.48%, respectively. The sports sponsorship budget was executed in 93.55%, whereas the execution of the budget allocated to other sponsorship stood at 46.25%*.

The Company's personnel, together with their families, numbers over 10,000 individuals who are directly and indirectly associated with and financially dependent on the mine.

In its operations, apart from achieving positive economic results, the Company has to show interest in fostering values that integrate local communities. This is reflected in the support given to local social initiatives aimed at developing culture, research, education and health care, as well as building communal infrastructure and meeting other needs of the local community. Moreover, the Company sponsors sports and cultural activities. This philosophy benefits the Company, helps to promote a favourable image of a business that cares about non-economic activities and, first and foremost, encourages local initiative.

All beneficiaries are required by the provisions of the contract to issue a written statement confirming the acceptance of a donation, followed by a report on the use of the donation for the purpose specified in the contract. Such reports are submitted by the beneficiaries in the form of statements, descriptions, photocopies of invoices and other documents proving due execution of the contract of donation.
9.6 Adoption of CSR strategy for 2012÷2015
Since 2012, the Company has applied the Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy (CSR) for 2012÷2015. This basic corporate document presents the vision and objectives that Bogdanka intends to achieve through sustainable development. It was created on the basis of key CSR challenges faced by the worldwide mining industry.
For many years now, LW BOGDANKA S.A. has been applying a number of corporate responsibility practices to its business activities. The Strategy has allowed the Company to introduce order to some of these practices and undertake new measures in such areas as:
 ethics and communication transparency in business practice -- in 2013 all employees familiarised themselves with the Code of Ethics and signed a conflict of interest report; 77

Directors' Report on Operations of the LW BOGDANKA Group in 2013

 security and development of the company employees;
 innovative and active influence on the surroundings and the environment;
 achieving business objectives in accordance with the rules of sustainable development.
The CSR Strategy for LW BOGDANKA S.A. is also a commitment of constant monitoring of all the yardsticks of the activities undertaken, and to report the company's social engagement, for instance in sports and culture sponsorship, environmental protection, or improvement of the employees' security and self-development.
In the fourth quarter of 2013 the Company revised its existing social responsibility strategy adopted for the period 2012÷2015. The purpose of the revision was both a standard assessment of the degree of implementation of the set goals, and ­ first and foremost ­ the assessment whether these goals are update and adequate to the challenges the Company is facing. In consequence of a process, which lasted several months, at the beginning of 2014 a new strategy was adopted setting objectives and directions for activities to be undertaken in 2014÷2017. The priorities of social responsibility set therein, are now, in the management's opinion, more clear and comprehensible for the addressees and better reflect key areas of social and environmental activity. An easy perception makes the strategy a credible means in the communication within and outside the Company. At the same time a team of employees assisted by an external advisor are preparing the first CSR Report for the LW BOGDANKA Group, i.e. an opening report for 2012 and 2013, which will be published in the first half of 2014.
