In 2015 the Company balance amount decreased by 29.1% as compared with 2014. Total fixed assets decreased by 34.3% (by 646.2 million PLN). The change of fixed assets level was mostly influenced by:
 the decrease of long-term financial assets by 53.3% (388.2 million PLN), mainly caused by a write-down concerning a loan granted to BioPartners Holdings AG and the increased evaluation of loans granted to subsidiaries (see also item 17 of this report),
 the decrease of investments in the affiliates and subsidiaries by 46.9% (266.9 million PLN) resulting from write-downs updating the shares in BIOLEK Sp. z o.o., MJ BIOTON Life Sciences Ltd, BIOTON MARKETING AGENCY Sp. z o.o. and BioPartners Holdings AG (see also item 17 of this report),

 the increase of receivables from deliveries and services and other by 11.4% (5.4 million PLN). The current assets of the Company increased by 18.6% (38.6 million PLN). The change of the level of current assets was significantly influenced by:
 the level of stock increased by 37.4% (22.4 million PLN) to the value of 82.4 million PLN, in the result of extending the range of products sold (hospital, diabetes and cardiological medicines) and building up the stock of insulin for the increased demand due to foreign contracts, including the Chinese one, and with regard to the planned implementation of the technology of analogues SAIA and LAIA on the 10m3 line, which shall cause the reduction of insulin production capacity for commercial purposes,
 the increase of cash funds by 90.3% (7.1 million PLN) up to 14.9 million PLN,  the change of the level of assets for sale by 23.3 million PLN in the result of making the decision
on disposal of shares in MJ BIOTON Life Sciences Ltd (see also item 17 of this report),  the decrease of trade and other receivables by 14.1% (15.8 million PLN) to the value of 96.5
million PLN, in the result of a write-down for overdue receivables at risk of becoming bad receivables, The share of fixed and current assets in the balance sheet for 2015 amounted to 83.4% and 16.6% of the balance sum, respectively. The decrease of share of fixed assets by 6.7% is mainly due to write-downs updating the loan to BioPartners Holdings AG and shares in subsidiaries.

Company's equity capitals decreased by 33.8% to the level of 1.171 billion PLN, which was mainly due to the loss from 2015 incurred in the consequence of non-cash write-downs updating the loan and shares in subsidiaries.
The share of equity capitals in the structure of liabilities has decreased to the level of 79.0%.
As regards liabilities, there were recorded:  an increase of liabilities for credits and loans and other debt instruments by 55.8 million PLN, mainly being the result of change of the financing structure,  a decrease of trade liabilities and other by 13.0 million PLN, mainly in the result of decreased liability from the initial purchase of shares in MJ BIOTON Life Sciences Ltd,  an increase of accruals by 5.4 million,  a decrease of the provision for deferred income tax by 20.7 million PLN to the level of 3.2 million PLN.

3. Description of significant risks and threats with determination to which extent BIOTON S.A. is exposed to them
The risk related to rejection or delay in admitting Group's products for trading
New products of the Group may be admitted for trading on a given market only after obtaining proper approval according to the binding legal regulations. Preparation of documentation necessary to obtain such permission for a given product, especially on some of the markets, requires a lot of work and is time consuming. The procedure of obtaining such permission may turn out to be time-consuming. These reservations concern in particular the procedure of central registration of biotechnological products, which may be additionally prolonged due to frequent changes of regulations and interpretation doubts related thereto. The above factors may result in significant delays in introduction of new products for trading by the Group. Refusal or delay of permission to trade with the Group's products may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to the occurrence of side effects, interactions with other medicines or quality defects of given products of the Group.
It cannot be excluded that during application of a medicine, after it has been approved for trading, there occur unpredictable side effects as well as interactions with other medicines. Such situations may also concern the medicines available on the market for some time already and may cause certain actions to be initiated by appropriate authorities. For instance in Poland, should there be proven an unexpected, severe, adverse side effect of a medicinal product, threatening human life or health, no declared therapeutic efficiency or a risk inadequate to the therapeutic effect, the Minister of Health withdraws the permission for admission to trading. Moreover, in case of a justified suspicion that a medicinal product does not comply with the requirements defined for such product, the chief pharmaceutical inspector issues a decision on putting the trade of specified batches of a medicinal product on hold, in the territory of its operation. Existence of any of the above factors may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ average.
The risk of non-performance of the intended results of the development works within the field of biotechnological medicines
A significant part of the Group outlays is spent on financing development works, including development of biotechnological products. Development of operation in the biotechnological products market requires substantial investment outlays and the risk of not achieving the assumed results of development works within the scope of biotechnological products is much higher than in case of regular generic drugs. Failure of development works financed by the Company and the Group may cause the lack of possibility to regain the outlays through increased sale of biotechnological products developed in the result of the financed development works, which may have significant adverse effect on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to termination of the licence for production of recombinant human insulin
One of the most significant products of the Group, i.e. recombinant human insulin is manufactured, distributed and sold under the licence provided to the Company on 03.06.1997. At present, after taking over the rights from Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly Bio-Technology General Corp.), the licensor is Ferring International Center S.A. The licence is valid in a given territory for 15 years, starting from the date of registration of recombinant human insulin, however not longer than until 31.12.2019. After expiry of the above mentioned terms concerning a given territory, the Company will not be bound by the provisions of the licence agreement, but it can still produce and sell the insulin. The licence agreement may be terminated by the licensor in case the Company breaches provisions of the said agreement and in case of circumstances which prevent further performance of the agreement. Any possible earlier termination of the licence agreement shall mean that the production and sales of one of the most important products of the Group should be stopped, which may have negative effect on the operations, financial standing or operating results of the Group. Threat­ low.
Risk related to the strategy of commercialization of the Group's products on key markets
Group's strategy within the scope of commercialization of products of the group on key markets is based on cooperation with international pharmaceutical concerns under long-term distribution agreements. It is not certain whether the sales volumes assumed by the distribution partner of the Group will be obtained,
11

and in the consequence, whether the production and sales volume of the Group will reach the assumed level. The outlays on marketing and sales of the products of the group incurred by distribution partners, their resources kept on selected foreign markets and expertise and experience within the scope of promotion and sale of pharmaceutical products on a given market may not be sufficient to gain the assumed sales volumes. Taking the above into consideration, there is no certainty that the activity of the Group on the foreign markets shall bring expected effects. It cannot be excluded that the distribution partners of the Group shall not be able to achieve their goals and their marketing strategy on the export markets shall not be effective. Existence of any of the above factors may have significant, negative influence on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to the change of rules of medicines' refundability
In most of the countries in which the Group operates, the market of medicines, including the refunded medicines, is regulated in detail by appropriate legal regulations. On the grounds of such regulations there is established a list of refunded medicines, the scope of refund, including the prices, limits and grade of refund. Adverse changes of the legal regulations, for instance deletion of the medicinal products of the Group from the list of refunded drugs, introduction of a separate, increased limit of prices for refunding competitive products, change of the price limit or decrease of refunding grade of a given drug may have negative influence on competitiveness of the products of the Group, which may have adverse effect on the operation, financial situation or operating results of the Group. Threat­ average.
The exchange rate risk
A significant part of the Company revenues comes from the export of medicines and an important part of the components necessary for production of medicines by the Group is imported. Due to the above, a significant part of the Group revenues and the significant part of the costs is generated or incurred in foreign currencies. Moreover, most of the Company revenues from export are expressed in American dollars, while most of the imports are expressed in euro. The Group carries out operations on many markets where both the revenues and costs are incurred in foreign currencies. The Company also finances outlays on development works and operating costs in the companies of the Group in the form of loans in foreign currencies. In case there is no balance between the costs and revenues, and in the view of the lack of the balance between the revenues and costs in the same foreign currency, fluctuations of foreign exchange rates may have significant negative effect on the operation, financial standing or operating results of the Group. Threat­ high.
The risk related to changes of the legal regulations
The Group is vulnerable to the risk of changes in the legal and regulatory environment in the countries it operates in. The legal and regulatory environment in the countries it operates in have been and still is subject to frequent changes, and the regulations are not applied by courts and public administration authorities in the uniform manner. In case of Polish market the scope of impact of such factors has been much extended due to the fact of Poland's accession to EU in May 2004, in the result of which Poland was obliged to adopt and implement all legal acts of EU and acquis communautaire (a set of rights and obligations, including judgments of the European Court of Justice binding for all EU Member States). Threat­ low.
4. Proceedings pending before court, institution for arbitration proceedings or public administration authority
There are proceedings pending before Mazowieckie Voivod initiated by the heirs of the former owners of the property "Dobra Macierzysz" of 14.04.2009 to declare invalid the decision of the Head of the Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 15.04.1988 on taking over of two plots of land of the total area of 78.87 ha by the State Treasury and the decision of the Head of the Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 19.03.1990 on delegating the management of two plots of land of the total area of 77.83 ha to the Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics ("IBA").
The Company is also participating in four proceedings concerning establishment whether the properties singled out from "Dobra Macierzysz Orodek" were subject to the regulations of the decree of the Polish Committee of National Liberation of 6 September 1944 on implementing agricultural reform (Journal of Laws of 1945, No. 3, item 13 as amended) ("PCNL Decree"). On 29.08.2014 in three out of these proceedings the Voivodeship Administrative Court dismissed the Company's and IBA's complaints to the decision of 2nd instance authority confirming that the real properties were not subject to the regulations
12

of the PCNL Decree and to the refusal to suspend the proceedings concerning announcing invalid the decision of the Head of the City and Commune in Oarów Mazowiecki of 15.04.1988. The Company has filed cassation appeals to the Supreme Administrative Court concerning the judgements - they are not expected to be heard before 2016. As regards the fourth litigation proceeding ­ the Company filed a complaint to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development ("MARD") on the decision of the Mazowieckie Voivod of 30.03.2015 declaring that the singled out part of the rural property was not subject to the regulations of the PCNL Decree - according to the MARD letter dated 23.03.2016 the date of the hearing the appeal shall take place before 30.12.2016.
In the opinion of the Company, in the view of the up-to-date judicial decisions, and in particular in the view of the decision of the Constitutional Tribunal of 20.02.1991, the probability that the Company suffers any damage in the result of acknowledgement of potential claims of the heirs of the former owners of the property "Dobra Macierzysz" by appropriate authorities seems slight.
According to the Company the up to date decisions determining whether the real properties of "Dobra Macierzysz Orodek" were subject to the regulations of the PCNL Decree, although contrary to the legal position of the Company, do not affect its legal situation, as the Company's title to the real property is based on the agreement on the transfer of the perpetual usufruct right concluded with IBA.
In case of possible disadvantageous adjudication for the Company by the Mazowieckie Voivod declaring the decision made by the Head of Oarów Mazowiecki Commune dated 15.04.1988 and 19.03.1990 invalid, the Company will be entitled to take further legal actions, including among other lodging a complaint to the Voivodeship Administrative Court. Moreover, with regard to the plot of land No. 4/43 the Company shall be entitled to raise a claim towards IBA, which in the agreement concluded on 06.11.1997 stated that IBA shall be held responsible for any possible future claims of third parties.
5. Information on basic products, goods or services and their determination by quality and quantity and the share of particular products, goods and services (if they are significant) or their groups in the general sales volumes of BIOTON S.A., as well as the changes within this scope in the given accounting year
The main products and goods of the Company include:  recombinant human insulin in the form of a pharmaceutical substance and injection preparations,  orally taken anti-diabetic medicines,  blood glucose test strips  OTC medicines for diabetic patients,  antibiotics and anaesthetic drugs.
The sale on domestic market is carried out directly by the Company. The Company is selling its products outside Poland under cooperation agreements and sales agreements concluded with foreign and domestic partners, including the companies of the Group. In case of foreign commercial partners the cooperation covers mainly direct export. In case of domestic commercial partners, within the scope of export, the products are delivered by the Company to locations specified by the commercial partners responsible for supplying the products abroad. International sales realized by Polish agents is classified in the financial statement as domestic sales and the same principle applies to the tables below relating to the sales by range of products.

16. Assessment of the possibility of realization of the investment assumptions, including capital investments, as compared with the volume of funds, taking into consideration possible changes in the financing structure of such operation

On the grounds of the resolution of the Managing Board of the Company of 06.06.2013, amended by the resolution of the Managing Board of the Company of 13.06.2013, on 29.07.2013 ("Date of Issue") the Company issued and the National Depository for Securities registered 79,200 Company bearer series B bonds of the face value of 1,000.00 PLN each and the total face value of 79,200,000.00 PLN, whose issue price corresponds to the face value ("Series B Bonds"). The final redemption of the Series B Bonds shall take place 36 months after the Date of Issue, i.e. on 29.07.2016. The interest on the Series B Bonds is variable, i.e. equals to the WIBOR 3M rate increased by the margin of 4.50%. The bonds are secured with Company assets in the form of real estate mortgages, registered mortgages on machines and equipment and on shares of the Company's subsidiaries. The purpose of issue of Series B Bonds was partial redemption of Company series A bonds convertible into series Z shares ("Series A Bonds"). The redemption of the remaining part of Series A Bonds: (i) in the amount of 19,950,000.00 PLN took place on 08.07.2013 through payment of the redemption instalment in the amount of 50,000.00 PLN for each of the Series A Bonds, (ii) in the amount of 600,000.00 PLN took place on 06.08.2013.

The conclusion of the above mentioned credit agreements completes the process of change of the Company's bank indebtedness structure, consisting in the change of a short-term debt into a long-term debt adjusted to the Company's development plans, and significantly reduces the costs of debt financing.
17. Assessment of factors and untypical events having influence on the Company' result for the accounting year, specifying the influence of such factors and untypical events on the results achieved
Since July 2015 significant changes have been introduced in the shareholders structure of BIOTON S.A. At present nearly 50% of Company shares are held by institutional shareholders, among which the leading role is played by two Chinese pharmaceutical concerns and a private equity investment fund. Changes in the shareholding structure resulted in changes in the business strategy of the Group which assumes, among other, cooperation with the main industrial shareholders of the Company aiming at the extension of the products portfolio of the Group, and reinforcement of its position on the global pharmaceutical market, as well as further increase of sales of insulins manufactured by the Company, both on the markets where the product is already commercialized and on new foreign markets. The new industrial shareholders are operating mainly on Asian market where they hold a large portfolio of licences for medicines which may significantly extend the portfolio of the Group. In short time the largest beneficiary of this cooperation may become the company SciGen Ltd. and its subsidiaries which is able to introduce selected products to Asian, Pacific and Australian markets through its distribution and marketing networks. At present works are pending on the adjustment of such products to the portfolio of the Group and on determining the time of their introduction to the market and their influence on future revenues and gains of the Group.
In the result of the redefinition of business strategy, the Company has made a number of decisions concerning further engagement in some of the projects. Their main premise was the limitation of financial risk, reduction of operating costs of the Company, focusing the existing resources on key competence and acceleration of the financial effect of commercialization of the already owned assets on selected markets.
In 2015 the Company continued operations implemented in the previous years and related to the increase of Company and Group products sales, and maintaining operating costs on sustainable level.
These operations focused on the following key areas:
1. consolidation of products portfolio focused on the acceleration of the effects of commercialization of the key product of the Company ­ recombinant human insulin ­ and focusing the research and development activity on the products with the highest market potential, mainly including long and short acting human insulin analogues.
2. reduction of operating costs, decrease of the demand for external financing and adjustment of the existing infrastructure to the new requirements of execution of the strategy in selected markets,
3. focusing the strategic operations of the Group on the specified key competences, i.e.:  manufacturing high quality biotechnological products,  research and development of new biotechnological products,  actions within the area of registration of biotechnological products in the key global markets for the purpose of their further commercialization in cooperation with the leading pharmaceutical concerns operating in the global market,
4. significant reduction of indebtedness and increase of the stability of the financing structure of the Group.
5. development of product's portfolio within products for diabetes treatment and cardiology, and a new line of medicines sold to hospitals.
In the result of the change process, as at 31.12.2015 there were made certain write-downs updating the value of assets in the standalone and consolidated financial statement. The write-downs have been based on the estimated usable value of the respective assets which is current, approximate value of the future cash flow, which are expected from the further use of such assets.
Below we provide detailed information concerning the update of the assets in the standalone balance sheet of the Company as at 31.12.2015.
22

Write-downs updating the value of the Capital Group BioPartners Holdings AG
As at 31.12.2015 the Managing Board of the Company has made an analysis of the perspective of development of sales of respective products in the portfolio of BioPartners Holdings AG and its subsidiaries ("Biopartners Group"), taking into consideration the commercialization possibilities, competition on the market, financial funds available for further financing the development and commercialization works together with the expected commissions on the sale of the above mentioned products. The analyses result in the write-downs updating their value.
Ribavirin - coated tablets (,,Ravanex")
In order to evaluate the product Ravanex Biopartners Group has taken into consideration that there is no entity interested in commercialization of the product and the cost of validation of the contracted production process is high, which considerably exceeds the sales margins on this product. The result of the valuation of the licence for manufacturing and sale of Ravanex based on the method of future discounted cash flows gives null value, therefore there has been applied a write-off to null value for this product.
Interferon beta ("Biferonex")
In February 2009 Biopartners received negative decision of CHMP as regards permit to trade with Biferonex in the territory of the European Union. The assessment report containing experts' remarks was made known to the public by EMA in August 2009.
Despite the negative decision of CHMP, the Biopartners Group has continued its works on:
 the possibility to start anew the procedure of registration documentation at EMA,
 the possibility of registration and commercialization of the product on other markets.
The analyses made by the Biopartners Group concerning the re-start of the EMA registration documentation assessment procedure revealed the necessity to perform the clinical trials of the 3rd phase anew. Taking into consideration the level of necessary investments and risks associated with the continuance of the project, it has been decided that the activities aiming at the registration of the product Biferonex with EMA should be discontinued, and as at 31.12.2009 the Managing Board of the Company made a write-down of the carrying value to the usable value of the licence, estimated on the grounds of the method of possible future discounted cash flows in the amount of 69.1 million PLN.
After 2009 the Biopartners Group has continued the operations aiming at the assessment of the possibility to obtain registration on other markets, find distribution partners in different countries in the world, in particular in Russia, China or South American countries. Global market of interferon beta has also changed from the therapy with injection medicines to oral medicines / tablet therapy, which considerably reduced the expected proceeds from commercialization of that product. Considering the fact that the product has not been registered in the European Union and despite the actions taken, it has been decided that there is no possibility to commercialize the product on other markets, and there existed premises for making the write-off for the loss of the value of the licence for the production and sales of Biferonex to null value.
Sustained release growth hormone ("Valtropin SR")
BioPartners Group and the Managing Board of the Company have analysed the perspective to develop sales and possibility to supply Valtropin SR from the Biopartners Group's portfolio, taking into account the complications in cooperation with the manufacturer of Valtropin SR ­ Korean concern LG Life Sciences Ltd. ("LGLS") and commercialization difficulties related thereto, and the competitive environment on the market and expected sales margin on the above mentioned products.
On the basis of development works and registration processes conducted with LGLS since 2002, in August 2013 Biopartners Group was granted registration certificate authorizing it to sell and distribute Valtropin SR in the European Union ("Registration Certificate"). The form of commercialization of this product initially considered by BioPartners Group was the conclusion of an appropriate agreement with an entity operating on international scale, with an established position on the market of endocrinological medicines. Such entity, selected in several rounds of negotiations, in 2014-2015 conducted a comprehensive due diligence study of the registration dossier supported by the participation of scientists within endocrinology, and conducted due diligence study of LGLS factory in Korea. Unfortunately, due to protracted negotiations concerning the agreement on supply of Valtropin SR by LGLS, the distribution
23

agreement with the selected partner has not been concluded. Therefore, taking the above into consideration, BioPartners Group decided to commercialize Valtropin SR on its own, with the support of other companies belonging to the Capital Group BIOTON S.A.
Due to the occurrences taking place during the last few months, there have been identified significant risks related to, among other:
 possible lack to ensure stable and long-term supplies of Valtropin SR meeting the strict requirements of the European Medicines Agency (EMA),
 impossibility to agree the final version of the contract ensuring the undisturbed promptness of supplies and quality of products (although the general terms have been defined in the licence contract with LGLS), which was discussed with LGLS numerous times and
 the risk of expiry of the Registration Certificate, whose validity, in case of the lack of commercialization of Valtropin SR on the market, expires in August 2016.
Taking the above into account, and considering the discussions and analyses carried out by the Managing Board and Supervisory Board of the Company, Biopartners Group decided to make a write-off for the lost value of the licence for manufacturing and sale of Valtropin SR, to null value.
Write-offs concerning the value of Biopartner Group's products result in write-downs in the standalone financial statement of BIOTON S.A. in the amount of 485,393 kPLN.
Write-downs BIOLEK Sp. z o.o.
BIOLEK Sp. z o.o. ("Biolek") operates in the segment of veterinary products and human products. In the first group Biolek has one innovative product to be used in pig farming, named Suilectin ("Suilectin"). This product is subject to registration in the central procedure in the EU ("EFSA Registration") at the moment and despite many additional inquiries, clinical trials conducted and extended process, there is a chance that the registration in the EU will be obtained in 3rd quarter of 2016. Parallel with the Suilectin registration process, the Managing Board of Biolek took actions aiming at commercialization of the product, first on the EU member states markets. In the consequence of talks with potential distributors of Suilectin, Biolek has selected an international entity which will be responsible for distribution, marketing and sale of the product in the world, except for the territory of China and USA. At present the entity is getting ready for the commencement of distribution of Suilectin, by carrying out the analysis of prices on the market in order to determine the best cooperation model with the recipients of the product. It is assumed that the registration of Suilectin on Chinese market shall take place within 12-18 months from the date of EFSA Registration.
Biolek has signed a contract for Chinese market with the company Beijing Smile Feed Sci&Tech. Co., LTD for three products: "Suiacid", "Birdacid" and "Suilectin", but the two first, despite a number of attempts to commercialize them are not able to compete with local competitors due to the high price of supplies being the result of high prices of the contractual manufacturer. Taking into account the experience from negotiations with an international entity on other markets, the schedule of registration process and the development of Chinese market, and discussions with members of the Supervisory Board of the Company, the Managing Board of Biolek adopted a conservative attitude towards market development, sales volumes, selling prices on the market, and commissions earned, while estimating the usable value of the licence, which is the current, estimated value of future cash flows expected from the further use of those assets.
Therefore, considering the above premises, the Managing Board of the Company decided to make a partial write-down of the carrying value of the licence for the sale of products under the agreement with Beijing Smile Feed Sci&Tech Co. Ltd. to the usable value of the licence, estimated on the grounds of the method of possible future discounted cash flows (whose source shall be the sale of Suilectin) in the amount of 179,700 kPLN.
Write-downs updating the value of the Capital Group MJ BIOTON Life Sciences Ltd
The Company holds 50% of shares in MJ BIOTON Life Sciences Ltd ("MJ BIOTON", together with the subsidiaries "MJ BIOTON Group"), and further 50% of shares are held by a partner associated with the Shah family ("Partner"). The Company acquired 50% of shares in 2008, paying cash and issuing shares, whereas the last lot of 5 million USD should be paid as soon as the Partner obtains insulin registration in the European Union. According to the investment agreements, the Company is entitled to 50% of profit
24

from the licence related to the insulin registration in the EU following the central procedure in EMA. The cost of registration shall be covered by the Partner. The insulin subject to registration in the European Union is not manufactured by the Company and is supplied by an entity other than the Company. Due to the fact that EMA has issued a negative decision on admitting the product to trade in the territory of the European Union, because the supplier of the active substance had failed to deliver all documents, and because product's commercialization on the EU market was not possible, there existed premises to writeoff the loss of value of the EMA insulin licence to null value. In this situation, and in the consequence of losing the possibility to follow-up the course and results of the R&D works performed by the MJ BIOTON Group that constitute the primary operations of the MJ BIOTON Group, the Company is no longer able to affect the financial results of MJ BIOTON. The Company has decided to dispose of MJ BIOTON shares for not less than 6 million USD.
In the result of making the decision to sell 50% of MJ BIOTON shares, there was posted an effect on the standalone result in the amount of minus 20.1 million PLN.
Write-downs updating the value of shares BIOTON MARKETING AGENCY Sp. z o. o.
With regard to the planned simplification of the structure of operations of the Capital Group, in 2016 the Company plans that marketing operations of the subsidiary BIOTON MARKETING AGENCY Sp. z o.o. shall be transferred to BIOTON S.A. together with the employees and agreements, and shall be continued in similar business range as until now.
Assuming the above change, the Company priced the shares held in BIOTON MARKETING AGENCY Sp. z o.o. as the net value of assets of that company, in the amount of 3.9 million PLN.
The write-down updating the value of BIOTON MARKETING AGENCY Sp. z o.o. shares in the standalone financial statement of BIOTON S.A. amounts to 16.0 million PLN.
18. Characterization of external and internal factors significant for the development of the enterprise of BIOTON S.A. and the Group and description of development perspectives of Company's and Group's operations at least until the end of 2016, taking into account the elements of market strategy worked out by them
18.1. Factors significant for the development of the Company and the Group
Range of Group's products The range of Group's products includes recombinant human insulin, as well as other pharmaceutical products, including the biotechnological ones. Competition in the biotechnological products market is much lesser than in the markets of other pharmaceutical products due to significantly smaller number of competitors and significant barriers hindering entering this market. Margins in the market of biotechnological products are among the highest in the pharmaceutical market.
Confirmed expertise in development of biotechnological products and their introduction from the laboratory level to industrial production The Company has got documented experience in development of biotechnological products. In 1997 it bought from the American biotechnological company - Bio-Technology General Corp. the licence for manufacturing human insulin with the use of patented, genetically modified bacteria strain E. coli, as well the technology of production of insulin and its dosage forms at laboratory scale. During the subsequent four years the Company developed production of the active substance and dosage forms of human insulin at full industrial scale and obtained registration in Poland. During the next years Company specialists worked over the increase of efficiency of the process of insulin production. Insulin production, due to its scale and sophistication level, is one of the most complicated processes of production of biotechnological products. Documented experience within the scope of development of highly efficient processes of production of biotechnological products is one of the most important competitive advantages of the Company.
25

Possibilities to develop new products The Company and the Group are developing a range of new biotechnological and pharmaceutical products. Thanks to well-educated and experienced staff and cooperation with IBA it is probable that the planned extensive investments in development shall result in the introduction of new biotechnological products. Within the scope of development works of the Group there are continued the works over human growth hormone with prolonged release and insulin analogues.
High qualified and experienced specialists BIOTON S.A., as the only Polish company manufacturing biotechnological products is able to attract key biotechnology specialists in Poland. The Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics is a leading research institute in Poland and employs highly qualified and experienced specialists. On the grounds of cooperation agreement with IBA the Company is to receive an offer for cooperation with regard to any new IBA project.
Strong marketing in Poland The Company has developed second largest team for insulin marketing in Poland, which is responsible for marketing and information of doctors and patients.
Cooperation aiming at entering new markets According to the strategy of the Group the Indian, Russian and Chinese markets have got priority. The Company has decided to start cooperation with international pharmaceutical companies which have strong position in the local markets.
Insulin quality/modern production process The Company is the only manufacturer of human insulin in Poland, and one of the few in the world, which use the process of recombination of DNA. Insulin manufactured by the Company is a high quality product. Both the insulin and the injectors are manufactured following the GMP principles and comply with the European Pharmacopoeia. The analysis of insulin products is carried out with the use of the given chemical, biochemical validations and microbiological analytical methods. Production plants and quality control laboratories have implemented quality control system compliant with the EU guidelines.
18.2. Perspectives of development of the operation of the Company and the Group
In the opinion of the Managing Board of the Company, the year 2015 was another year of organizing the Group and implementing the redefined strategy. The Company and the Group successively increase the sale of insulins and other diabetes, cardiological and hospital products in Poland and on main foreign markets. In the opinion of the Managing Board of the Company, on the grounds of the agreements concluded by the Company one may expect increased sale in the years to come. The Company has completed the process of investment in the insulin substance manufacturing capacity scale and production of dosage form, as the Company was granted the registration, which should allow better use of the product line capacity in the future and would contribute to reduced production costs. Development of sale in respective companies within the Group is of great significance for the results, including the development of products portfolio in the companies belonging to the Capital Group SciGen Ltd, development and conclusion of investment in the factory in Italy, which allows earning positive margins, and development of the veterinary sector. At the same time, the foreign exchange and macroeconomic situation due to the Russian crisis may, in a short-time perspective, have an adverse effect on the results, especially as regards the sale of generic medicines.

Identification of the rule
PART I:
Rule I.5.

The rule whose application cannot be guaranteed by the Company constantly or within the full range

Explanation

Recommendations concerning good practices of the listed companies

The Company should establish a remuneration policy and determine the rules of its establishment. The remuneration policy should in particular define the form, structure and level of remuneration of the members of supervisory and managing bodies. While establishing the policy of remuneration of supervisory and managing bodies the directive of the European Commission of 14 December 2004 on support of appropriate remuneration system of managers of listed companies (2004/913/EC), supplemented with the CE directive of 30 April 2009 (2009/385/EC) should apply,

Due to detailed provisions in the Company's Statute, the Company may not accept the entire rule in question with the present reading.
Pursuant to §23 clause 3 of the Statute "Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board is established by the Supervisory Board."
Whereas the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, is established according to Art. 392 §1 of the Code of Commercial Companies, by way of a resolution of the General Meeting of the Company.

29

Rule I.12.
Part II Rule II.1. Rule II.1.1. Rule II.1.9a.
Rule II.3.

The Company should make it possible for the shareholders to exercise the voting right during a general meeting, personally or through a proxy, outside the place at which such general meeting is held, with the use of electronic communication means.

In the opinion of the Company, the risk of disruption of the proper course of the session due to technical and logistics reasons, whose complete elimination cannot be guaranteed by the Company, shall go beyond the shareholders' benefits resulting from the use of the above mentioned rule. The Company's position is that the present rules of participation in the general meeting ensure proper and effective exercising the rights resulting from the shares held and sufficiently secure the interests of all shareholders, including the minority shareholders.

Good practices applied by the managing boards of listed companies

The Company maintains a corporate web site and publishes there, beside information required by the applicable legal regulations:

 basic corporate documents, in particular the Statute and company Due to Company position as regards rule IV.2, the Company cannot

bodies' regulations,

publish on its web site the regulations of the general meeting.

 publication of the record of the course of a general meeting's agenda The Company practice to date, as well as the practice of many public

in the audio or video format,

companies does not confirm the need to broadcast the session, register and

make the session minutes of the general meeting available to the public. It

is Company's position that the information on convening and the course of

the General Meeting published by the Company as required by the

applicable law, is sufficient for the shareholders and other persons who are

not participating in the Meeting, to become acquainted with the issues on

the agenda.

Before conclusion of any significant agreement with an affiliate, the Managing Board applies to the supervisory board for approval of the given transaction/agreement. The above obligation does concern typical transactions which are entered into under market conditions within the scope of operating activities of the Company with an affiliate in which the Company holds majority capital share. For the purpose of the present set of rules there is assumed a definition of an affiliate as provided for in the resolution of the Minister of Finance issued on the grounds of Art. 60 paragraph 2 of the act of 29 July 2005 on public offering and conditions of introduction of financial instruments to organised turnover system and on public companies (Journal of Laws No. 184, item 1539 as amended).

The Company shares the opinion that the Managing Board should seek approval of the Supervisory Board for conclusion of a significant agreement with an affiliate. Due to detailed provisions in the Company's Statute, the Company may not accept the entire rule in question with the present reading. Pursuant to §21 clause 1 of the Statute, the competence of the Supervisory Board shall include:
,,2) granting approval to conclusion of agreements between Affiliates and the Company and performing other actions for Company's Affiliates, in case the value of such agreements or actions exceeds during consecutive 12 (twelve months) the amount of 500,000 EUR or its equivalent in other currencies, except for typical and routine actions taken under market condition between the affiliates, whose

Rule III.6.

nature and conditions result from the current operating activity conducted by the Company or any of its affiliates."

Good practice applied by members of the supervisory boards

Beside the activities specified in the applicable legal regulations a supervisory board should:

 review and give opinions on matters being the subject matter of The Company shares the need to review and provide opinion on matters

resolutions of the general meeting.

being the subject matter of resolutions by the general meeting by the

supervisory board. However, the Company cannot guarantee, that it will

obtain opinion of the supervisory board on each matter that is to be the

subject matter of a resolution of the general meeting in time sufficient to

enable the shareholders to get acquainted with it. Sometimes it may be

required, due to practical reasons, that the general meeting is convened

quickly and the supervisory board itself will not have enough time to issue

opinion before the general meeting or to consult experts prior to issuing

the opinion.

A member of the supervisory board should provide the managing board of the Company with information concerning its links with a shareholder holding shares which represent not less than 5% of the overall number of votes at the general meeting. The above obligation pertains to links of commercial, family or other nature, which may influence the position of the member of the supervisory board in a matter recognised by the board.

It is Company's opinion that it could not guarantee procedures enabling information on all links of "other nature" due to the ambiguity of this term. In the opinion of the Company, non-disclosure of such information shall not affect transparency of Company operations, due to Company's intent to apply the rules of corporate governance providing for that in case there is a conflict of interests or it is likely to take place, a member of the supervisory board should notify the supervisory board and refrain from participation in a discussion and voting in the case, with regard to which such conflict has occurred.

At least two members of the supervisory board should fulfil the criteria of independence from the company and other entities significantly affiliated to the company. As regards the criteria of independence of members of the supervisory board, there should apply Appendix II to the European Committee Order of 15 February 2005 concerning the role of nonexecutive directors or directors not being members of supervisory boards of listed companies and (supervisory) board committee. Notwithstanding the provisions of item b) of the aforementioned Appendix, a person who is not an employee of the company, a subsidiary or an affiliate cannot be deemed as fulfilling the criteria of independence referred to therein.

The Company acknowledges that good corporate governance should include independent members' participation in the supervisory board. Due to detailed provisions included in §18 of the Company's Statute, the Company may not accept the entire rule in question with the present reading. According to §18 of the Company's Statute:
,,1. One of the members of the Supervisory Board appointed by the General Meeting should comply with all of the following conditions:

1)

has been appointed in the mode as provided for in clause

31

Moreover, a link with a shareholder, excluding the independence of a member of the supervisory board as provided for herein, shall be actual and significant link with a shareholder entitled to exercise 5% and more of the overall number of votes at the general meeting.

3;

2)

cannot be an Entity Affiliated to the Company or

a subsidiary of the Company;

3)

cannot be an Entity Affiliated to a holding company or

another subsidiary of the holding company, or

4)

cannot be a person who is in any way related to the

Company or any of the entities specified under item 2)

and 3), who could significantly influence such person's

ability, as a member of the Supervisory Board, to make

impartial decisions.

2.

To avoid any doubts, the links referred to under clause 1 item. 2)-

4) do not pertain to being a member in the Supervisory Board of

the Company.

3.

Appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board that should

fulfil the conditions specified under clause 1, takes place in

a separate ballot. With the reservation of clause 4, the right to

propose candidates for members of the Supervisory Board

fulfilling the conditions specified under clause 1 shall be given to

the shareholders present at the General Meeting, whose aim is

appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board referred to

under clause 1. The proposal is submitted in writing to the

Chairman of the General Meeting and is attached a written

statement of a given candidate that he consents to being

a candidate and complies with the conditions as specified under

clause 1 item. 2)-4). Should the shareholders fail to propose the

candidates in the manner specified in the preceding sentence,

candidates for the Supervisory Board, complying with the

conditions specified under clause 1 item. 2)-4), shall be proposed

by the Supervisory Board.

4.

Authorized Founder is not entitled to propose candidates for

a member of the Supervisory Board referred to under paragraph

1."

Moreover, according to § 21 clause 2 of the Statute "resolutions concerning issues as specified under clause 1 item 1 to be valid require

32

Rule III.8. Rule III.9.
Part IV Rule IV.1
Rule IV.2

that their adoption is voted for by a member of the Supervisory Board who fulfils the conditions specified under § 18 clause 1 of the Statute."

However, pursuant to § 21 clause 1 item. 1 of the Statute, such resolutions include the resolutions concerning: "appointment of the entity performing audit or review of consolidated and standalone financial statements of the Company, giving consent to conclusion of agreements with a given entity or its subsidiaries, subordinate entities, holding companies or subsidiaries or subordinate entities of its holding companies and for any other actions which may negatively affect independence of such entity while performing the audit or review of the financial statements of the Company".

As regards the scope and functioning of committees acting within the supervisory board, there should be applied Appendix I to the European Committee Order of 15 February 2005 concerning the role of nonexecutive directors (...).

See clarification to rule III.6

Conclusion of an agreement / transaction between the company and an See clarification to rule II.3 affiliate, as referred to in part II item 3 shall require approval of the supervisory board.

Good practice applied by the shareholders

Representatives of mass media should have the possibility to attend general meetings.

In principle, the Company acknowledges the assumptions behind this rule and considers it a good corporate practice. In its operation the Company takes numerous actions aiming at maintaining good relations with mass media and carries out efficient information policy. However, one cannot exclude a situation where the Company does not provide the representative of mass media with a possibility to attend the general meeting due to the necessity to ensure efficient course of the session.

The rules of the general meeting shall not prevent the shareholders from participating in the general meeting and exercising their rights. Any amendments of the rules should become binding not earlier than starting from the next general meeting.

The Company practice to date, as well as the practice of many public companies does not confirm the need to introduce the rules of the general meeting that would specify in details the rules of carrying out the general meeting. Therefore, it is Company's opinion that the appropriate regulations of the Code of Commercial Companies be sufficient grounds to efficiently conduct the general meeting in the Company, including voting in separate groups.

33

Rule IV.10.

the Company should provide the shareholders with the possibility to participate in the General Meeting with the use of the means of electronic communication, consisting in:
1) broadcasting the General Meeting session in real time,
2) two-way communication in real time, providing the shareholders with the possibility to take part in the discussion under the meeting while staying at some other place than the location of the meeting.
