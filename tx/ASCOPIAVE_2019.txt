REPORT ON OPERATIONS
Foreword
The Ascopiave Group closed 2019 with a net consolidated profit of Euro 493,2 million (Euro 46.5 million as of 31st December 2018), with an increase of Euro 446.7 million, compared to the previous year, attributable for Euro 447.0 million to the sale of the natural gas sales companies of the Ascopiave Group to the Hera Group. The consolidated net assets as of 31st December 2019 amount to Euro 873.5 million (Euro 447.9 million as of 31st December 2018), and the net invested capital to Euro 1,086.5 million (Euro 565.4 million as of 31st December 2018). In 2019, the Group accomplished investments for Euro 34.4 million (Euro 29.8 million in 2018), mainly in the installation of electronic metres, as well as the development, maintenance and modernisation of gas distribution networks and facilities. The process begun in the last months of 2018, aimed at enhancing the gas sales activities and strengthening and consolidating the Group's presence in the distribution sector, was completed on 19th December 2019. Such process involved the approval, on 17th June 2019, of a business partnership with Hera S.p.A. through the execution of a binding Term Sheet for the development of a leading company in Northern-Eastern Italy (Term Sheet finalised in a framework agreement on 31st July 2019). The conclusion of the partnership between the two companies led to the establishment, through EstEnergy, of the largest Energy player in Northern-Eastern Italy to which the Ascopiave Group contributed with the sale of the gas and energy sales companies. As part of the operation, the Ascopiave Group also acquired the newly established company, consolidated on a line-by-line basis, Ap Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l., to which the Hera Group had previously granted concessions for the distribution of gas, with approximately 188,000 users in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The operations resulted in total investments of Euro 617.9 million and a positive flow from divestments of Euro 616.2 million. In compliance with the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 5 "Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations", the effects related to the transaction were shown separately in a single line of the income statement and the data shown for comparative purposes were reclassified accordingly. The balance sheet and cash flow data shown for comparative purposes were also restated in compliance with the standard. On 1st July 2019, the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. was merged through acquisition into Ascopiave S.p.A.. Subsequent to this operation, the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. is no longer consolidated using the equity method, but on a line-by-line basis. On the same date, Ascopiave S.p.A. transferred the merged unit to Edigas Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A..
Activities Ascopiave mainly operates in the sectors of distribution, as well as in other sectors related to the core business, such as heat management and co-generation. The Group currently holds concessions and direct assignments for the supply of the service in 268 municipalities (230 municipalities as of 31st December 2018 (the change in the number of concessions managed is mainly related to the entry into the consolidation scope of the company Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est S.r.l.), and has a distribution network extending for over 12,855 km1 (over 9,809 km as of 31st December 2018; 2,977 km due to the expansion of the scope of consolidation), providing services to a catchment area bigger than 1 million inhabitants.
Strategic objectives Ascopiave aims to pursue a strategy focused on the creation of value for its stakeholders, by maintaining the level of excellence in the quality of services offered, respecting the environment and social groups, to increase the value of the field in which it operates. The Group intends to consolidate its leadership position in the gas sector on a regional level and is looking to reach a prominent position also at the national level, taking advantage of the liberalisation process currently underway. In this respect, Ascopiave follows a development strategy whose main guiding principles are dimensional growth, diversification in other divisions of the energy sector in synergy with the core business and the improvement of operative processes.

Operating performance The volumes of gas distributed through the networks managed by the Group were 1,107.1 million cubic metres1, marking an increase of 1.9% compared to 2018. The distribution network as of 31st December 2019 has an extension of 12,855 km1, an increase of 3,046 km compared to the previous year, a change mainly due to the line-by-line consolidation of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. and the entry into the consolidation scope of Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est S.r.l.. Economic results and financial situation Consolidated revenues in 2019 totalled Euro 124.9 million, compared to Euro 115.3 million of the previous year. The increase in the turnover is mainly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation due to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. and the consequent recognition of the revenues achieved by the business unit for natural gas distribution services and contributions for white certificates related to the energy efficiency objectives under the scope of the company. The Operating Result of the Group equals Euro 21.6 million, up Euro 0.5 million compared to 2018, explained by the decrease in the margin on energy efficiency certificates (Euro -4.0 million) and higher amortisation and depreciation (Euro -2.4 million), partially offset by lower personnel costs (Euro +1.6 million). The result of discontinued operations, equal to Euro 478.7 million (Euro 31.8 million in 2018), includes the capital gain due to the sale of the stake of the companies, which led to the related deconsolidation, net of the costs incurred for its realisation. The Net Result, equalling Euro 493.2 million, marks an increase of Euro 448.9 million compared to 2018. The Net Financial Position of the Group as of 31st December 2019 is equal to Euro 213.0 million, a worsening of Euro 95.5 million compared to Euro 117.5 million as of 31st December 2018. The increase in financial indebtedness is determined by the cash flow of the period 2019 (Euro +37.3 million, given by the sum of the net result, before the results of the discontinued operations, and amortisation and depreciation). The investment activity has absorbed financial resources for Euro 47.7 million. The management of equity (distribution of dividends and dividends received from the companies consolidated using the equity method) has absorbed resources for Euro 94.5 million, of which Euro 11.8 due to the discontinued companies. The ratio of Net financial position to Net equity as of 31st December 2019 is 0.24 (0.26 as of 31st December 2018).

Reference economic context
During 2019, although the forecasts remained uncertain and despite the fear of the escalation of some geopolitical tensions, world trade began to expand again, albeit at limited levels, also because the United States and China, which reached a first trade agreement in December, lessened their disputes over tariffs. Weakness in manufacturing, particularly marked in Germany, curbed the economic activity of the Euro area, and also influenced Italy's economic growth. Some recent OECD projections estimate that in 2019 the world domestic product increased by 2.9% on average compared to the previous year ­ the lowest value since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 ­ and that in 2020 it could grow by 2.9%. The OECD subsequently changed the November forecasts in its Interim Economic Outlook by cutting the 2020 estimate by 0.5 points due to the health emergency that is spreading worldwide. The OECD specified that uncertainty about world growth remains very high and if the world situation worsens, the global growth could significantly decline and stop at 1.5%. During 2019, the economic activity slowed down during the summer months in China, decreased more markedly in India, while it remained rather stable in Russia and Brazil. World trade and manufacturing remained weak, showing a trade growth of 0.9% in 2019. In the Euro area, the economic activity was supported by domestic demand, especially by consumption, which strengthened by virtue of the good trend in employment. The weakness remained concentrated in the industrial sector, where business contracted in the summer months, while the service sector showed some growth. GDP in 2019, according to the latest available estimates, grew by 1.2%. The projections that see a growth of 1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021, due to the COVID 19 health emergency, were revised downwards by the ECB. Real GDP growth was forecast at 0.8% for the current year and 1.3% for 2021. During 2019, inflation remained stable, and according to forecasts it will remain limited over the 2020-2022 threeyear period, consistent with the moderate growth in economic activity. As regards the economic situation of the Italian economy, in 2019 the overall GDP growth is estimated at 0.2%, supported in particular by domestic demand, mainly by household spending. Investments decreased, especially those in capital goods, and foreign exchange was negative. The consumer price index remained very low, especially due to energy prices. The employment trend confirms an overall increase in employment and at the same time a decrease in unemployment and inactivity. The Interim Economic Outlook published by the OECD revised downwards, in line with the world trend, the performance of the national GDP, forecasting a 0% growth, but left unchanged the forecasts for 2021 which envisaged an expected growth of 0.5 %.
Gas distribution
Gas distribution, subsequent to the finalisation of the partnership between Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Hera Group, effective 19th December 2019, is the first activity of the Group in terms of contribution to company income. This activity is carried out as a concession or direct assignment and, as such, is subject to strict regulation by the public authorities, with regards to both management methods and tariffs. As it is known, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 introduced the compulsory allocation of the gas distribution service through a call for tenders, assuming that a competition mechanism for the selection of the provider would enable the end customer to contain costs and an improvement in the quality of the service supplied. Law Decree 159/2007 (Law 222/2007) introduced, for the first time, the concept of Territorial Tender (Atem) for the management of the service, establishing that the tender procedures must be launched by territorial areas. Atem tenders were subsequently definitely adopted as a basic rule for the sector with Legislative Decree 93/2011 which has forbidden, commencing June 2011, the launch of invitations to tender in the individual Municipalities, ratifying the obligation to launch tenders exclusively in minimum territorial areas. Therefore, the majority of analysts foresee, in the medium term, a strong concentration in the offer, with a reduction in the number of operators and an enlargement of the average size of the companies. Since 2011, with special reference to calls for tenders in territorial areas, the regulatory framework of the industry was updated yet again through the issuance of a number of ministerial decrees. In particular:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|13 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

1) the Decree dated 19th January 2011 issued by the Ministry for economic Development in agreement with the Ministry for the Relationship with Regions and Territorial Cohesion, the territorial areas for issuing calls for tenders to entrust the gas distribution service were identified;
2) with subsequent Decree dated 18th December 2011, the municipalities belonging to each territorial area were also identified (the so-called Territorial Areas Decree);
3) the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry of Employment and Social Policies on 21st April 2011 contained provisions ruling the social effects connected to the assignment of the new gas distribution concessions, thus implementing paragraph 6 of art. 28 of Legislative Decree no. 164 issued on 23rd May 2000 (the so-called Workforce Protection Decree);
4) with the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development on 12th November 2011, the regulations concerning the criteria to be applied to calls for tenders and the evaluation of the offer for assigning the gas distribution service were approved (the so-called Decree for Criteria).
The issuance of ministerial decrees played a major role in giving certainty to the competitive environment within which operators will move in the coming years, thus laying the foundations for allowing the process of market opening - that started with the implementation of European directives - to produce the benefits hoped for. The Ascopiave Group favourably welcomed the emerging regulatory framework, believing that it actually creates important opportunities for investments and development to qualified medium-sized operators, going in the direction of a positive rationalisation of the offer. At the end of 2013, with Law Decree 23/12/2013, no. 145, converted with amendments into Law 9/2014, art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000, which governs the determination of the reimbursement value of the plants due to the outgoing operator at the end of the so-called "Transitional Period", was substantially modified. In June 2014, the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development containing the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" entered into force, which, although formally aimed at explaining the criteria to assess the value of plants pursuant to art. 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011, essentially establishes a peculiar framework, which implements only to a minimum extent art. 5 above (in its original version, in force upon the issuance of the guidelines). Subsequently, with Law Decree 91/2014, amended and converted into Law 116/2014, another substantial change was made to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000. The contents of the revised text and its evolution are described in sections "National regulations" and "Goals and policies of the Group and description of risks" of this financial report. Finally, in mid-2015, the Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development no. 106, dated 20th May 2015, amended the previous Ministerial Decree 226/2011, reformulating Article 5, concerning the criteria to calculate the value of the plants. The new Decree has basically "transferred" the content of the Guidelines (mentioned above) into its text. Concisely, this measure has made Article 5 compatible with the Guidelines, which would have been a specification/clarification.

Efficiency and energy saving obligations
The Letta Decree, in article 16, paragraph 4, states that natural gas distribution companies must pursue energy saving objectives and the development of renewable energy sources. The definition of the national quantitative objectives and the criteria for the assessment of the results obtained was requested from the Ministry for Economic Development, in agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and Land Protection, which led to the issue of the ministerial decree of 20th July 2004. With the Decree dated 21st December 2007, the Ministry for Economic Development reviewed and updated the Decree dated 20th July 2004, on the following points: - the 2008 and 2009 objectives were reviewed in the light of an excess of offer of energy efficiency certificates
recorded on the market; - the objectives for the three-year period 2010 - 2012 were defined, considering the target of reduction of energy
consumption fixed by the action plan as of 2016, equal to 10.86 MTOE; - the efficiency and energy saving obligations for each year following 2007 were extended to distributors which, as
of 31st December of two years prior to each year of obligation, connected more than 50,000 end customers to their distribution network.
The energy saving objectives, that apply both to natural gas and electricity distributors, set out by the Decree dated 20th July 2004, integrated by the Decree dated 21st December 2007, are equal to: - 0.10 Million TOE for the year 2005; - 0.20 Million TOE for the year 2006; - 0.40 Million TOE for the year 2007; - 1.00 Million TOE for the year 2008; - 1.40 Million TOE for the year 2009;
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|15 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

- 1.90 Million TOE for the year 2010; - 2.20 Million TOE for the year 2011; - 2.50 Million TOE for the year 2012.

The fulfilment of energy saving is attested through the distribution of energy efficiency certificates, the so-called "White Certificates". In order to fulfil the obligations as specified by the Decree dated 20th July 2004, integrated by the Decree of 21st December 2007, and to thus see their White Certificates recognised, distributors can: - carry out direct interventions to improve the Energy efficiency of technology installed or related methods of use; - acquire the White Certificates directly from third parties, by means of bilateral contracting or through
negotiation in an appropriate market set up at Gestore dei mercati energetici (GME).

With Decree dated 28th December 2012, new objectives of annual primary energy savings were defined for the period 2013-2016 for the obliged distributors, and in particular: - 4.6 Mtoe in 2013; - 6.2 Mtoe in 2014; - 6.6 Mtoe in 2015; - 7.6 Mtoe in 2016;

For natural gas distributors, the quota of the above-mentioned obligations corresponds to the following white certificates: - 3.04 million white certificates to be achieved in 2014 - 3.49 million white certificates to be achieved in 2015 - 4.28 million white certificates to be achieved in 2016

For years 2013 and 2014, the obligor must deliver a quota at least higher than 50% of its annual obligation that must be compensated in the next two years in order to avoid penalties. For years 2015 and 2016 the minimum value is set at 60% of the obligation, and it is always possible to compensate in the next two years in order to avoid penalties. In addition, Decree dated 28th December 2012 gave effect to the provisions of Decree 28/2011 which sets that the activities of management, evaluation and savings certification related to energy efficiency projects undertaken as part of the mechanism of white certificates are transferred to the GSE - Gestore dei Servizi Energetici. The Decree also extended to parties other than distribution companies and the Energy Saving Company (so-called ESCO), the opportunity to present projects in order to obtain white certificates.

Decree dated 11th January 2017, published in the Official Gazette no. 78 dated 3rd April 2017, defined the new

national goals for energy saving for the relevant distribution companies for the years 2017-2020. For natural gas

distributors the quota of the above-mentioned obligations corresponds to the following white certificates:

-

2.95 million white certificates to be achieved in 2017

-

3.08 million white certificates to be achieved in 2018

-

3.43 million white certificates to be achieved in 2019

-

3.92 million white certificates to be achieved in 2020

Furthermore, the decree dated 11th January 2017 defines the new guidelines for presenting energy efficiency projects: the old mechanism was reviewed by eliminating the "tau" coefficient, the useful life of projects was extended and the standardised forms were eliminated.

The Decree dated 10th May 2018 reviewed the tariff contribution for the subjects to which the obligation applies, introducing a ceiling of Euro 250 per TEE as a maximum reimbursement. Furthermore, given the scarcity of certificates with respect to demand, "unsecured" certificates were introduced, that is, certificates issued by the GSE at the request of the distributors to which the obligation applies, which have at least 30% of the certificates of the current objective in the portfolio. Unsecured certificates can cost up to a maximum of 15 Euros/TEE and can possibly be redeemed the following year by the distributor.

Significant events during FY 2019
Approval of the project of merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A. On 28th January 2019, the Boards of Directors of Ascopiave and Unigas approved a business combination to be implemented by means of the merger through acquisition of Unigas into Ascopiave, immediately followed by the concentration in Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. of Unigas's operating activities in the network segment. Through the Combination Project, Ascopiave and Unigas pursue the objective of entrusting the activities they perform in the gas distribution sector in some areas of Lombardy to a single operator, thus further improving their positioning on the market and the quality standards of the service provided in the relevant territories. The terms and conditions of the Merger are governed by a framework agreement signed between Ascopiave, Unigas and, limited to the assumption of certain commitments, Anita S.r.l., as the reference partner of Unigas. The Merger plan has been submitted for validation to the respective Shareholders' Meetings as well as Anita's Shareholders' Meeting. The auditing firm Reconta Ernst & Young S.p.A. has been appointed by the Court of Venice as an expert for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the adequacy of the share exchange ratio, pursuant to art. 2501-sexies, Italian Civil Code. This opinion has been made available in accordance with the applicable legislation. Ascopiave's Shareholders' Meeting, in extraordinary session, approved the project of the merger through acquisition of Unigas into Ascopiave S.p.A. (the "Merger") and, thereby, the Merger. On 24th April 2019, Ascopiave announced that the Shareholders' Meeting of Unigas convened on 23rd April approved the project of the merger through acquisition of Unigas into Ascopiave. Therefore, the decision-making process related to the aforementioned merger is completed. On 25th June 2019, subsequent to the approval of the operation by the Shareholders' Meetings of both companies, the deed of merger through acquisition of Unigas into Ascopiave was signed. The share exchange ratio of 3.7788 Ascopiave shares with a nominal value of Euro 1.00 to each Unigas share with a nominal value of Euro 1.00 was confirmed, since the conditions for making an adjustment pursuant to the merger project were not met. The merger took effect on 1st July 2019. Also on 25th June 2019, as part of the merger and with effect from the effective date of the latter, Ascopiave transferred to Edigas, a wholly owned subsidiary, the operating activities of Unigas in the networks sector. In the first week of July 2019, Ascopiave S.p.A. transferred 7,149,505 treasury shares to Anita S.r.l..
The Merger The Merger was implemented through (i) cancellation of the shares representing 100% of Unigas's share capital on the date of execution of the Merger deed and (ii) transfer to Anita, in exchange for its stake in Unigas, of treasury shares of Ascopiave, without the need to proceed with an increase in the share capital of Ascopiave due to the swap. Pursuant to art. 2501-quater, second paragraph, Italian Civil Code, for both companies the applicable balance sheet for the Merger is contained in the interim financial statements at 30th September 2018. The share exchange ratio determined by the Boards of Directors of Ascopiave and Unigas, supported by their respective financial advisors, is 3.7788 treasury shares of Ascopiave to each Unigas share whose nominal value is Euro 1.00. On the basis of the aforesaid exchange ratio, therefore, 7,149,505 Ascopiave treasury shares, equal to 3.05% of Ascopiave's share capital after the Merger, were transferred to Anita. As better described in the Merger plan, the aforesaid share exchange ratio could have been adjusted solely due to the effect of any payment, prior to the effective date of the Merger (i) of an ordinary dividend by Ascopiave and/or Unigas and/or (ii) an extraordinary dividend possibly resolved by Ascopiave's Shareholders' Meeting, as notified to the market on 8th June 2018, in order to allow the majority shareholder Asco Holding S.p.A. to pay the liquidation value to its shareholders who exercised their right of withdrawal, as they did not participate in the acceptance of the resolution for the approval of certain amendments to the articles of association adopted on 23rd July 2018. "The Operation ­ said Nicola Cecconato, Ascopiave's Chairman ­ is a step forward in the consolidation process of the Ascopiave Group in the Natural Gas Distribution sector, consistent with the strategy to strengthen the Group's assets in the field of regulated activities. The consolidation of the activities currently managed by Unigas will enable us to improve the efficiency levels and the services provided in the relevant territories, by capitalising on the industrial expertise of the companies involved".

|22 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Ordinary and extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, held on 23rd April 2019 The Shareholders' Meeting of Ascopiave S.p.A. ("Ascopiave" or the "Company") convened in ordinary and extraordinary session on 23rd April 2019, chaired by Mr Nicola Cecconato. The Shareholders' Meeting, in ordinary session, approved the financial statements and acknowledged the Group's consolidated financial statements as of 31st December 2018 and resolved to distribute an ordinary dividend of Euro 0.125 per share. The Shareholders' Meeting, in ordinary session, approved the Remuneration Policy, corresponding to Section I of the Remuneration Report compiled in accordance with art. 123-ter of the Unified Finance Law and 84-quater of Consob regulation dated 14th May 1999, no. 11971. The Shareholders' Meeting of Ascopiave S.p.A., in ordinary session, approved a new Purchase and sale plan of treasury shares to replace the authorisation to purchase and sell treasury shares issued by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 26th April 2018, which is therefore to be deemed revoked as regards the non-executed part. Upon the request of the Shareholder Asco Holding S.p.A., in ordinary session, the Shareholders' Meeting resolved to distribute an extraordinary dividend of Euro 0.2133 for each of the 222,178,966 outstanding shares, totalling Euro 47,390,773.40, to be withdrawn from the "Share premium reserve". Such extraordinary dividend was paid on 8th May 2019, with ex-dividend date on 6th May 2019 and record date on 7th May 2019. Ascopiave's Shareholders' Meeting, in extraordinary session, approved the project of the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. ("Unigas") into Ascopiave S.p.A. (the "Merger") and, thereby, the Merger. The Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting also approved the amendment of art. 6 of Ascopiave's articles of association, adding paragraphs 6.6 to 6.18, in order to introduce the increased voting rights mechanism, pursuant to art. 127quinquies of the Consolidated Finance Law. Specifically, the increased voting rights mechanism will grant 2 voting rights for each Ascopiave share that has belonged to the same shareholder for a continuous period of at least 24 months from the registration in a special list, which will be established and stored by the Company at the registered office.
Press release by Asco Holding S.p.A. On 8th April 2019, with reference to the announcement dated 6th March 2019, Asco Holding S.p.A. ("Asco Holding" or the "Company") announced that, as regards the withdrawal procedure of the shareholders who did not participate in the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting resolution dated 23rd July 2018 concerning certain amendments to the articles of association, the period to exercise the right of pre-emption, whose offer was filed with the Company Register of Treviso and Belluno on 7th March 2019, for 28,279,062 shares for which the right of withdrawal was validly exercised and whose liquidation value determined by the Board was challenged, ended on 5th April 2019. No shareholder of Asco Holding exercised the first option to buy. Should the Company receive communications of exercise of the first option sent within the deadline stated in the pre-emption offer notice, it will promptly notify it. There were 41,945,221 withdrawal shares, equal to 29.96% of Asco Holding's share capital. The unit liquidation value to be paid by the Company will be equal to Euro 3.75 for the withdrawing shareholders who have not challenged the liquidation value and Euro 4.047 for the withdrawing shareholders who have challenged the liquidation value. The withdrawal procedure was completed, as soon as technically possible, subsequent to the approval by Ascopiave's Shareholders' Meeting convened on 23rd April 2019, on first call, and on 26th April 2019, on second call, of the distribution of an extraordinary dividend as suggested by Asco Holding and subject to payment of such dividend.
Ascopiave and Hera Group: a large energy partnership in northern-eastern Italy Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Hera Group completed the transaction which led, on 19th December 2019, to the establishment of the largest energy player in Northern-Eastern Italy, boasting over one million customers, and the simultaneous reorganisation of their respective gas distribution activities. The closing, subsequent to the framework agreement dated 30th July and the ensuing approvals by the competent authorities and bodies, involved the exchange between the Hera Group and Ascopiave of assets of equal value, in the energy sales activities, on the one hand, and in gas distribution, on the other. The economic aspects of the transaction did not change compared to the announcements, except for the adjustments at the closing date envisaged by the framework agreement signed in July, as well as the arrangements defined for governance and the options to handle the stakes of Ascopiave in EstEnergy and Hera Comm. The operation represents

an important step in the evolution of the business portfolios of the Hera and Ascopiave Groups, fully consistent with the development lines approved by the respective Boards of Directors. The Hera Group, in fact, anticipates the achievement of the target set in the 2022 Business Plan, reaching around 3.3 million customers in the energy sales business. Ascopiave, on the other hand, implements its strategic repositioning plan, through the business agreement with a primary player, and the consolidation of its position in the core business of gas distribution. As regards energy sales, EstEnergy will be an operator for sales activities in Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Lombardy, with over one million customers (of which approximately 795,000 gas contracts and approximately 265,000 electricity contracts). In detail, the sales activities of the Ascopiave Group (Ascotrade S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A. and the joint ventures Asm Set S.r.l. and Etra Energia S.r.l.) and the investment in Sinergie Italiane S.r.l., for a total value of Euro 474.2 million, were transferred to EstEnergy, valued before the operation at Euro 191.7 million, in addition to those of the Hera Group (Hera Comm Nord-Est S.r.l.), valued at Euro 159.0 million. 52% of the share capital of the new EstEnergy is held by the Hera Group and 48% by Ascopiave (which has acquired its stake at a price of Euro 395.9 million, based on an equity value of 100% of EstEnergy, equal to Euro 824.9 million). The Board of Directors is made up of 5 members, 3 appointed by Hera and 2 by Ascopiave, in compliance with the Shareholders' Agreement signed between the parties. The directors appointed are: for the Hera Group: Stefano Venier (Hera Group, Managing Director), Cristian Fabbri (Hera Comm, Central Market Director and Managing Director, who will also take on the role of Managing Director of the new EstEnergy), Isabella Malagoli (Hera Comm, General Manager); for Ascopiave: Giovanni Zoppas (Thelios, Managing Director, who will also take on the role of Chairman) and Nicola Cecconato (Ascopiave Group, Chairman and Managing Director). Within the operation, for a period of 7 years, a put option, exercisable annually, was granted to Ascopiave up to the entire investment held in EstEnergy S.p.A. and a call option in favour of Hera Comm in the event of a residual investment of Ascopiave S.p.A. in EstEnergy S.p.A. which is less than or equal to 5% of the company's share capital. Specifically, the put option on the minority stake of EstEnergy may be exercised, in whole or in part, up to the seventh year from the closing, and at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the fair market value of the investment calculated at the exercise date and (ii) the value of the investment adjusted by an annual interest of 4% net of the portion of dividends received and in any case not less than the value of the investment itself. As regards the reorganisation of the gas distribution activities, Ascopiave has purchased from the Hera Group, for Euro 168 million, a scope of concessions comprising 188,000 redelivery points located in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, transferred on 31st December 2019 to the newly established company AP Reti Gas Nord-Est. By virtue of this operation, the Ascopiave Group manages approximately 775,000 users and over 12,000 km of network, consolidating its position in the national ranking. Lastly, as set out in the agreement signed at the end of July, Ascopiave acquired a 3% stake in Hera Comm at a price of Euro 54 million and the Chairman and Managing Director Nicola Cecconato was appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Finally, as part of the overall reorganisation of the energy sales activities, Hera Comm directly acquired 100% of the capital of Amgas Blu, a company entirely owned by Ascopiave, active in the province of Foggia, with about 50,000 customers, at a price of Euro 42.5 million. A mechanism in favour of Ascopiave is envisaged for the sale of the stake in Hera Comm, acquired by Ascopiave at the closing date, to be exercised in the same 7-year period.
Medium-term loan taken out with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) On 9th August 2019, the Parent Company took out a 5-year medium-term loan with BNL, for an amount of Euro 30,000 thousand, at a variable rate with repayment on principal through constant half-yearly instalments, and simultaneously signed an Interest Rate Swap agreement with the same bank, in order to eliminate the risk associated with the fluctuation of the interest rate.
Medium-term loan taken out with Crédit Agricole On 27th September 2019, the Parent Company took out a 5-year medium-term loan with Crédit Agricole for an amount of Euro 30,000 thousand, at a variable rate with repayment on principal through constant half-yearly instalments, and simultaneously signed an Interest Rate Swap agreement with the same bank, in order to eliminate the risk associated with the fluctuation of the interest rate. The loan was granted on 1st October 2019.

Medium-term loan taken out with Intesa SanPaolo On 29th November 2019, the Parent Company took out a 5-year medium-term loan with Intesa SanPaolo, for an amount of Euro 50,000 thousand, at a fixed rate with repayment on principal through constant half-yearly instalments.
Disclosure on the purchase of treasury share Ascopiave announces the purchase on the electronic share market, in compliance with the authorisation to purchase treasury shares resolved by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 23rd April 2018 subsequently resolved also in the Shareholders' meeting held on 23rd April 2019, in the period between 1st April 2019 and 31st December 2019 of 5,877,921 ordinary shares at the average unit price of Euro 3.807, for a total value of Euro 22,375,798.72. As a result of the purchases made, Ascopiave held 10,456,025 treasury shares, equal to 4.461%, of the share capital, for the value indicated above.

Additional significant events

Distribution of natural gas
The Group is active in the gas distribution sector through the companies Ap Reti gas S.p.A., Ap Reti gas Vicenza S.p.A., Ap Reti Gas Rovigo S.r.l., Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. which, commencing 1st July 2019, also includes the former Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., previously consolidated using the equity method. Effective 31st December 2019, the scope of the Group's gas distribution companies also includes AP Reti Gas Nord Est.

In 2019, the company's emergency intervention service, active 365 days a year, 24/7, which can be contacted by means of the dedicated free-phone number, performed 6487 interventions, and the arrival time was on average 38.48 minutes, largely less than the 60 minutes envisaged by the Authority. The correct odorization of gas was continuously monitored, performing a number of checks well above those prescribed by the Authority. The schedule of operation and maintenance activities was respected, and performed almost exclusively by internal staff.

In 2019, the process for streamlining the organisational structure, aimed at optimising the use of resources and the synergy between the Group's distribution companies, was strengthened even more. During the year, the implementation project for the new management software to support the main processes of the Group's gas distribution companies was completed, with the go-live of all the companies on 1st July and the simultaneous project of aggregation to the same management software of Unigas (subsequent to the transfer of its operating activities to Edigas).

In the second half of the year, the main project concerned the implementation of all the information systems of the new company AP Reti Gas Nord Est, operational commencing 1st January 2020, which manages gas distribution networks in the provinces of Padua and Udine. The project involved the migration of data from the previous operator's systems for all applications, including the user management system, the accounting and finance system, the human resource management system, the SAC (Central Acquisition System) for electronic metres, cartography systems, the Asset Management system etc. The software for assigning and accounting for works was further renovated and the Work Force Management system, for the management of operational activities on the territory, was further implemented. This made it possible to further reduce back office activities and implement a completely paperless system for most of the operational activities.

Ascopiave Group: performance of the volumes of natural gas distributed and network extension In 2019, the volumes of natural gas distributed through the networks managed by the Group were 1,151 million cubic metres, with an increase of 65 million cubic metres, mainly due to the line-by-line contribution of the former Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., previously consolidated using the equity method. The distribution network in 2019 has an extension of 10,044 km (9,269 km in 2018).

Ascopiave Group: number of redelivery points managed As of 31st December, the number of redelivery points (PDR) managed by the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis was 588.4 thousand and records an increase of 96.7 thousand units compared to the previous year (491.8 thousand as of 31st December 2018) also in this case mainly due to the acquisition of 100% of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. during the year.
Co-generation
In 2019, the co-generation activity was carried out by the Research and Development Department of the Ascopiave Group on behalf of Asco Energy S.p.A. As far as the activity of heat generation plants in co-generation is concerned, in 2019 three plants were managed: - The plant "Le Cime a Mirano (VE)", its remote heating network was extended increasing the saturation level of
connected household customers from 123% to 126%. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected clients and in summer to supply the absorber to produce cooling for air conditioning of connected users; - The plant "Bella Mirano a Mirano (VE)" the saturation level of household customers is unchanged (115%). The saturation above 100% is since, in addition to the original project, in 2014 two new condos were connected to the remote heating network, which did not belong to the initial project, but connected subsequent to a contribution, which fully covers the costs, paid by the builders of the two new condominiums. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected customers; - The plant "Cà Tron a Dolo (VE)" has maintained substantially the same saturation of connected residential customers (37% in 2018 and 36% in 2019). However, as of today, only 50% of the new urban area envisaged in the agreement has been built. The co-generation group has been operating at full capacity, working in winter to provide heating for connected customers; As far as the activities on thermal plants are concerned, in 2019 the Group managed 5 plants.
Energy efficiency and saving
As regards the 2018 objectives, all the Group companies to which the obligation applies achieved the minimum objectives; in November 2019, all the TEEs allowed were delivered on account in compliance with current regulations and the residual amount of 2017 of Unigas was cancelled. As regards the 2020 objectives, the sum for the three companies is 145,846 TEEs.
Subscription, with the Municipalities involved, of a convention for the adoption of a shared procedure aimed at the agreed quantification of the "Residual Industrial Value" of the networks
The regulatory amendments which have replaced each other over the past years and in particular the legislation which governed the selection of the operator of the distribution service through the so-called "territorial calls for tenders" tool, have led to, among other things, the need to determine the Residual Industrial Value (RIV) of the plants owned by the Operators. In relation to this aspect, the concession agreements governed two "paradigmatic" situations, namely:
- the early redemption (normally governed regarding Royal Decree no. 2578/1925) and - the reimbursement from the (natural) expiration of the concession. The eventuality of a "force of law" expiration, preceding the effective date of the "contractual" expiration, (as a rule) was not envisaged (and therefore governed) in the concession deeds. Substantially, the case in question (earlier termination imposed by law) represents a "third category", in some ways similar to the exercise of early redemption (from which, however, it differs significantly for the lack of a will independently formed to that effect by the Body) and in other ways similar to the expiration of the concession term (which however has not expired). At least until Ministerial Decree 226/2011, there were no legislative and/or regulations which precisely defined the methods and criteria to determine the R.I.V. of the plants and which could therefore complement the contractual clauses, often deficient.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|27 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 as well, until the recent amendment introduced in the first place with Law Decree 145/2013, and then Law 9/2015, merely referred to Royal Decree 2578/1925 which, however, ratified the method of the industrial estimate without setting precise assessment parameters. The situation illustrated above entailed the necessity to define specific agreements with the Municipalities aimed at reaching a shared estimate of the R.I.V.. The lack of such agreements in the past has often led to administrative and civil/arbitral litigations. The situation of the Municipalities partners of Asco Holding S.p.A. was even more peculiar in the sense that, with the latter, there is not a real concession deed in "canonical" form, but various deeds of assignment to Companies ("Azienda Speciale", at the time). These deeds have ratified, at the same time, the continuation of the award of the service previously provided by the Bim Piave Consortium. It is evident that, as deeds of assignment, a real regulation concerning the purchase and/or the termination of the management was not and could not be envisaged. With the above-mentioned partner Municipalities, Ascopiave has signed a convention, which implied hiring a renowned independent competent professional in order for him to determine the fundamental criteria to apply to calculate the RIV of the gas distribution plants. The related negotiated procedure performed adopting the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender ended on 29th August 2011. The expert has written a report (made available on 15th November 2011) on the "Fundamental criteria to calculate the RIV of the natural gas distribution plants located in the Municipalities currently serviced by Ascopiave S.p.A." which was approved on 2nd December 2011 by Ascopiave's Board of Directors and then by all 92 Local Bodies by City Council Resolution. In 2013 Ascopiave submitted the state of consistency and the appreciation of the plants determined applying the criteria set in the Report, offering at the same time its willingness to perform the cross-examination with the Municipalities, aimed at analysing the documents. To date, following the outcome of the technical cross-examination, 86 Municipalities (unchanged since 31st December 2015) have approved the residual value. As part of the above process, the reciprocal relations mostly connected to the management of the service were governed as well, since both the payment of "one-off" amounts (2010 ­ signature of supplementary deeds) for Euro 3,869, and (since 2011) real fees for variable amounts and equal to the difference, if positive, between 30% of the "restriction on revenues" recognised by the tariff regulation and the amount already received by the Municipality itself as a dividend in 2009 (financial statements 2008) are envisaged. In particular: - Euro 3,869 thousand in 2010; - Euro 4,993 thousand in 2011; - Euro 5,253 thousand in 2012; - Euro 5,585 thousand in 2013; - Euro 5,268 thousand in 2014; - Euro 5,258 thousand in 2015. - Euro 5,079 thousand in 2016; - Euro 5,190 thousand in 2017; - Euro 5,258 thousand in 2018; were paid for a total amount of Euro 45,753 thousand. During 2015, Ascopiave S.p.A. made available to the Municipalities belonging to the Minimum Territorial Areas of Treviso 2 - Nord and Venezia 2 ­ Entroterra and Veneto Orientale (69 municipalities out of 92), an update of the valuations of the plants as of 31st December 2014. Subsequently, in the two-year period 2016-2017, the municipalities belonging to the Treviso 2 - Nord and some municipalities belonging to the Treviso 1 - area were provided with an update as of 31st December 2015, by applying the valuation criteria agreed upon and by providing a calculation of the assessment of private contributions to be deducted from the residual industrial value pursuant to Law 9/2014. The contracting authorities in the territorial areas of Treviso 2 - Nord and Venezia 2 ­ Entroterra and Veneto Orientale sent ARERA the assessments of the reimbursements of some municipalities for the purposes of the verifications provided for by the legislation. The Authority has made some observations (then forwarded by the same contracting authorities) against which AP Reti Gas filed (and/or is about to file) its counterclaims.

Litigations
LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS - CIVIL LAW As of 31st December 2019 the following are pending:
MUNICIPALITY OF SANTORSO: An appeal is pending before the Court of Appeal of Venice, filed by the Municipality of Santorso (appeal of the final award dated 18th July 2017, which ordered the Municipality to pay Ascopiave the amount of Euro 1,346 thousand plus interest (effective the date of the ruling). Total expenses, offset between the parties, amounted to approximately Euro 221 thousand. Upon the hearing before the Court of Appeal of Venice which was held on 9th January 2019, the Court set the hearing for the clarification of the conclusions on 27th May 2021. A settlement agreement is being negotiated.
LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS ­ ARBITRATIONS As of 31st December 2019 no litigations are pending.
ADMINISTRATIVE/CIVIL LITIGATIONS ­ CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2019, the following are pending:
MUNICIPALITY OF SOVIZZO: The Municipality of Sovizzo initiated a civil Judgment with writ of summons served on AP Reti Gas S.p.A. on 21st February 2019. The Entity requires the payment of a concession fee amounting to Euro 65,000/year as from 1st January 2013. The appearance hearing, initially scheduled for 19th June 2019, was postponed to 10th September. There are no further significant procedural events. The Company, in the light of the previous negotiation agreements, challenges the claim of the Municipality and has therefore entered an appearance in compliance with the Law.
Two administrative judgments, pending before the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy (Milan), initiated by AP Reti Gas S.p.A. in order to challenge the City Council resolutions adopted by the two Municipalities, communicated to the Company and concerning the belated exercise of the power of negotiation conferred on the same Municipalities in the original concession deed (which should have been exercised within 10 years from the beginning of the concession). It appears that all the neighbouring Municipalities (located in the Valganna area) have adopted similar resolutions (although the ten-year terms for exercising the right expired between 1998 and 2001). If such resolutions were to be notified to AP Reti Gas, the latter will challenge them. The scheduling is still pending. A settlement agreement is being negotiated.
MUNICIPALITY OF FOSSALTA DI PORTOGRUARO Administrative judgment, pending before the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto, brought by AP Reti Gas for the appeal of City Council Resolution no. 52/2019, with which the Municipality of Fossalta di Portogruaro intended to launch a competitive procedure for the sale of the sections of the distribution network owned by the Municipality, in violation of the principle of unitary circulation of the ownership of the distribution facilities with the management of the service (to be considered latent, in the Company's opinion, in the current regulatory framework). In addition to this aspect (already in itself invalidating), the Provision also appeared flawed in two further aspects:
1. the source bid was a value (RAB) that is not current, but merely prospective, resulting solely from the approval of the tariff application submitted some time ago by the Municipality (through AP), but not yet examined by ARERA;
2. assumed the existence of economic obligations (payment of royalties or similar fees) under the scope of AP Reti, in violation of the agreement in force.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|29 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The appeal was notified on 18th December 2019 (the deadline for the submission of bids was 19th December 2019. No bids were received. AP therefore waived the application for interim relief (the Regional Administrative Court, at the hearing of 8th January 2020, acknowledged the waiver), but decided to file the appeal in any case, given the current validity of the City Council Resolution appealed. However, the Company is willing to withdraw if the aforementioned Resolution is revoked.
ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2019, the following are pending:
GUIDELINES ­ MINISTERIAL DECREE 22nd MAY 2014 An appeal before the Council of State was filed (with deed dated 16th January 2017) by Ascopiave together with other distribution companies, against the Minister of Economic Development for the cancellation of Judgment no. 10341 dated 17th October 2016, by which the Regional Administrative Court of Latium rejected the main appeal against Ministerial Decree 22nd May 2014 concerning the introduction of the Guidelines for the determination of the residual industrial value and the appeal for "additional grounds" against Ministerial Decree no. 106 dated 20th May 2015, amending Ministerial Decree 226/2011. As part of the same proceedings, the issues of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling as concerns Law 9 and 116 of 2014, in the section which has modified art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (private contributions and time limit of agreements' validity) were raised. The Council of State decided to refer the matter (of the legitimacy of the primary regulations) to the examination of the European Court of Justice. The Court of Justice ruled that the European law does not preclude the national legislation challenged (but) in the sense that the law itself does not govern (and therefore is not affected by) the methods for determining the reimbursement value of the outgoing operators. The hearing for the "re-assumption" of the case before the Council of State was held on 18th July. Ascopiave's lawyers reaffirmed the relevance of the issue of constitutionality of the legislation.
ARERA RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 310/2014 and ARG/GAS 414/2014 (now 905/2017) An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the ARERA, for the cancellation of the Resolutions ARG/gas 310 and 414/2014 related to the methods for assessing the RAB RIV delta, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (current text) when the difference is higher than 10%. To date, there are no further procedural steps. Resolutions 310 and 414 were formally repealed by Resolution 905/2017 which, however, essentially reiterated the same regulation. Ascopiave, therefore, together with other appellants, in order to avoid the declaration stating that the appeal would in any case be of no benefit to the claimants, appealed Resolution 905/2017 with "additional grounds". On 3rd December 2019, the Company was notified of the imminent expiration of the proceedings. The Company will consequently file the request for scheduling a hearing, within the deadlines set.
CONTESTATION OF PASUBIO GROUP S.P.A. CONTRACT DOCUMENTS (currently AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A.): 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. filed an appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto against the Town of Schio and Ascopiave S.p.A. (notified on 10th October 2016), demanding annulation, subject to protective orders, of the temporary award of the tender to Ascopiave S.p.A., or the call for tenders and all subsequent acts, requesting that the tender be awarded to the appellant or, subordinately, be republished. The Administrative Court of Veneto (hearing dated 9th November 2016) overruled the protective order by 2i Rete Gas. The claimant then filed a claim to the Council of State. The C.o.S. overruled the request for a single-judge solution and opted for a full Council sentence. On 2nd February 2017, the Council of State hearing took place. During the hearing, the Council sustained the supervision order 644/2016 of Administrative Court of Veneto, thus rejecting the appeal by 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. for the suspension of application of the tender document pending decision on the main appeal to the Administrative Court of Veneto.

|30 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

As a result, on 3rd April 2017 Ascopiave stipulated a sale agreement to purchase the share interest of Pasubio Group, becoming its sole shareholder. With Judgement no. 925/2019, published on 14th August 2019, the Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeal. The terms for the possible appeal of 2i Rete Gas are currently pending.
ANAC GUIDELINES ON ART. 177 LEGISLATIVE DECREE 50/2016 AP Reti Gas S.p.A. (together with other primary operators of the gas and electricity distribution services, as well as with the intervention, ad adiuvandum, of Utilitalia) filed an appeal before the Regional Administrative Court for Latium - Rome, for the cancellation of the ANAC Guidelines no. 11/2018, pursuant to art. 177 of Legislative Decree 50/2016. Article 177 of Legislative Decree 50/2016 establishes that, from 18th April 2018, the holders of concessions whose amount is equal to or greater than Euro 150,000, if identified "without a tender procedure", will have to assign a share equal to 80% of their contracts through public tender procedures, for the remaining portion being able to resort to in-house or subsidiary/associated companies. ANAC is in charge of supervision in accordance with the methods set out in its own Guidelines (no. 11/2018). Such Guidelines - even though formally they do not produce binding effects on the matter - establish that the concessionaire is required to put out to tender (as they are included in the percentage of 80%) all the activities performed during the concession, including those performed directly with own means and resources, thereby drawing an outsourcing obligation from the regulation. The Special Committee of the Council of State considered this interpretation correct, but noted that, construed in this way, art. 177 could be unconstitutional. When applied in this way, the regulation would have an extremely significant impact both on the business choices and employment levels of the Companies holding concessions with assignments without tenders (moreover, perfectly lawful at the time of their assignment). Article 177, construed in this way, therefore, seems illegitimate both with regard to constitutional principles (e.g. free economic initiative pursuant to Article 42 of the Italian Constitution), and with regard to the "prohibition on worsening" sanctioned by Community law. In this context, AP Reti Gas S.p.A., as the Group's main distribution company, challenged the aforementioned Guidelines, also raising the question of constitutional and Community legitimacy with regard to the primary rule. Furthermore, on 2nd November 2018, ANAC, subsequent to a simple collection of data related to all existing concessions in any sector, submitted a report to the Government and Parliament on the state of the concessions (focusing in particular on the gas sector) stating that the latter would not comply with the regulations in force. As a precaution, the Appeal was supplemented with additional grounds concerning the aforementioned Report. The discussion hearing was held on 22nd May 2019. The Regional Administrative Court, in line with previous rulings related to the proceedings brought by other operators, with Judgement no. 9326, published on 15th July, declared the appeal of AP Reti Gas inadmissible because the documents challenged are incapable of causing detriment. The "positive" aspect of the ruling concerns the "disqualification" of the Guidelines no. 11 by the TAR. The Judges, in fact, considered the Guidelines as merely interpretative documents, as far as Part I is concerned, and not immediately detrimental documents, as far as Part II is concerned. Specifically, Part I would not be suitable to identify the subjects required to apply art. 177 and/or the scope and methods of application of art. 177, but would only "outline principles of a general nature aimed at helping the administrations to which they are addressed to interpret the matter...". Part II, on the other hand, although self-qualified as "binding", would not have an immediately detrimental nature because "... the economic operators who decide not to comply with the indications contained therein due to the peculiarity of the concession relationship do not immediately incur the penalty". Law Decree no. 32/2019, converted into Law no. 55/2019, extended the deadline contained in paragraph 2 of art. 177 which now reads: "The existing concessions stated in paragraph 1 must comply with the aforementioned provisions by 31st December 2020". AP Reti Gas filed an appeal. Furthermore, as a merely prudential measure, essentially in order to avoid objections due to lack of interest, the Company also challenged ANAC Resolution 570/2019 (which approved the updated text of the Guidelines 11, although essentially identical to the previous one).

Press release of ANAC's Chairman issued on 16th October 2019 An appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio ­ Rome was brought by AP Reti Gas (together with other primary operators of gas and electricity distribution services), for the cancellation of the Press Release of ANAC's Chairman dated 16th October 2019. Such provision basically intended to extend the obligations of the contracts under Legislative Decree 50/2016 (e.g. acquisition of CIG - Contract Reference Number - and payment of ANAC contribution) also to those contracts which are excluded from and even unrelated to the application of the Code. After consulting other leading operators belonging to Utilitalia, AP Reti Gas, as the largest distribution company of the Ascopiave Group, for merely prudential reasons (as Press releases are not considered sources of mandatory rules), decided to file an appeal, notified on 24th December 2019.
ARERA RESOLUTION ARG/GAS 570/2019 AP Reti Gas (together with other primary operators of gas distribution services) filed an appeal with the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against ARERA, for the cancellation of Resolution 570/2019/R/gas, illustrating the "tariff regulation of gas distribution and metering services for the 2020-2025 period". The new regulatory framework envisages a strong and unjustified reduction in the tariff items covering the operating costs recognised to distributors. The appeal was filed on 25th February 2020.
CIVIL LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2019, the following are pending:
ASCOPIAVE ­ UNIT B: A civil judgment before the Court of Treviso (RG 6941/2013), following the pre-trial technical investigation, in order to obtain compensation for damages to the entrance floor of the "Unit B", was started by Ascopiave against: Bandiera Architetti S.r.l. (Designers), Mr Mario Bertazzon (Contract Manager) and Mr R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali S.r.l. (Contractor). The compensation request refers to an assessment of damage between approximately Euro 127 thousand (Expert witness estimate for full restoration) and Euro 208 thousand (estimate of a Third-party firm for full makeover). All the Parties regularly appeared before the Court. The Court, by Order dated 22nd December 2014, decided the complete renewal of the expert witness board. The "new" Court-appointed Expert witness assessed that the damage suffered by Ascopiave S.p.A. amounts to approximately Euro 120 thousand. Based on the findings contained in the technical report, on 29th March 2016 an attempt was made to reach settlement in court. The attempt failed basically because an agreement was not reached regarding the subdivision of the amount between the debtors. With Judgment no. 2007/2017, the Court accepted the application submitted by Ascopiave S.p.A., ordering the design firm (F.lli Bandiera), its insurance company (Groupama Assicurazioni) and the construction company (Ing. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali SRL) to pay damages, amounting to approximately Euro 208 thousand, and to reimburse the costs of the proceedings (estimated at approximately Euro 17 thousand). Furthermore, the debtors' obligation to assume joint and several liability was ratified. The project management (and consequently the insurance company, Unipol Sai) was found to be uninvolved in the damage, with a right to obtain compensation for the costs of the proceedings, amounting to about Euro 16 thousand. With two separate documents, Groupama Assicurazioni and Ing. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali notified the appeal against the First Instance Judgment. Ascopiave S.p.A. entered an appearance in accordance with the legal terms. By Provision dated 7th June 2018, the Court of Appeal partially accepted the suspension request, limiting the provisional enforceability of the First instance sentence to the amount of Euro 150 thousand, against which Ascopiave S.p.A. is entitled to pursue the enforcement. However, the attempts at forcible recovery of the aforementioned sum have been unsuccessful so far. At the hearing of 28th June 2018, the Court of Appeal unified the appeals.

FORCED ENTRY ­ DEFAULT SERVICE Pursuant to the regulation obligation (specifically about Art. 40.2 letter A of the Integrated Text for the Sale of Gas TIVG), AP Reti Gas S.p.A. (as the other distribution companies of the Group) may, pursuant to Art. 700 of the Civil Procedural Code, obtain forced entry to private property in order to disconnect utilities (when the meter is located in a private property) of Default Service (SDD) clients that are in default. Appeals are made against final customers (or utility users). For this purpose (and to meet provisions of the regulations), the company has created a management procedure that starts with the activation of the SDD and ends with its closure (for any reason) of the SDD. The procedure also envisages to close any controversy via ordinary methods, collection of information, gathering of previous data and/or efforts to contact the involved final customers, notification of delays, past due notifications and, if all of the above prove unsuccessful, the opening of a judicial procedure, normally as an urgent appeal pursuant to Art. 700 of the Civil Procedural Code. Other distribution companies of the Group have opted for the same solution (AP Reti Gas Rovigo S.R.L., AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A., Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. and Unigas Distribuzione S.R.L.). Currently, for Ascopiave / AP Reti: - 4 procedures are in progress (they have been sent to the Legal Office and are awaiting filing); - 6 procedures have been filed (hearings already scheduled/under scrutiny); - 1 procedure is in execution of judgment; - 10 procedures are being initiated (their appeals are being drafted and sent to the Legal Office); - 3 procedures have been suspended (for various reasons); - 247 procedures have been completed (in various stages). Between 30 and 50 procedures for which legal action is likely to be taken are expected every year for all Group companies. The procedure and the consequent actions undertaken in the preliminarily phase have resulted in a significant reduction in legal actions, compared to the extent originally envisaged As of 31st December 2019, the total legal fees (including taxes), for Ascopiave S.p.A. / AP Reti Gas S.p.A.'s procedures forwarded to the Legal Office, amount to approximately Euro 212 thousand. For the other companies of the Group these costs amount approximately to Euro 131 thousand (including the costs of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., now merged into Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A.).
Relationships with Agenzia delle Entrate (Italian Tax Authority)
ROBIN TAX Regarding the outstanding litigations with Agenzia delle Entrate, some claims are pending with local tax agencies related to the silent / express refusal to reimburse the additional IRES tax (so-called Robin Tax). The Companies involved in the afore-mentioned litigations are: Ascopiave, Ap Reti Gas Rovigo, Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas, Unigas Distribuzione (merged into Ascopiave), Asco Energy (former Veritas Energia). Since 2008, these companies are subjected to the additional IRES tax as set forth by Art. 81 of Law Decree 112/2008. Subsequently the Constitutional Court in 2015 declared that said tax would be unconstitutional. In the wake of said sentence, the companies requested the reimbursement of the unwarranted tax that had been paid. The tax authorities did not reply and by doing so they effectively denied the reimbursement, or expressly denied it. Several claims have been filed based on a retroactive interpretation of said sentence, the legitimacy of which was confirmed by a Constitutional Law Attorney. Possible results of said claims are completely unpredictable, as the sustainment of the claim would cause a massive financial burden for the entire country. As far as the expected time of resolution of this litigation, no temporary framework can be provided, as these claims have been filed to various local courts with different response times. Currently, for Ascopiave S.p.A., the proceedings before the Veneto Regional Tax Commission, which confirmed the rejection of the reimbursement request, have ended. For the other companies, the various appeals are still pending before the relevant tax commissions. The Group has however decided to appeal in all 3 levels of judgment.

AUDIT OF THE REGIONAL DIRECTION OF VENETO In September 2019, the companies Ascopiave S.p.A. and Ascotrade S.p.A. were inspected by the Regional Direction of Agenzia delle Entrate as regards the Ires, Irap and VAT sectors for the years from 2013 to the date of the inspection. The first stage of the audit was completed on 29th October 2019 with the issuance of a Report on Findings containing remarks on the direct and indirect taxes related to the years 2013 and 2014 of the subsidiary Ascotrade S.p.A., a company sold on 19th December 2019 to the Hera Group and subject to a specific guarantee, against which the company presented its briefs. The results of the audit as regards the tax periods from 2015 onwards will be the subject of a separate Report on Findings which will be drawn up, if applicable, at a later date. Subsequent to the submission of the briefs, on 31st December 2019, Agenzia delle Entrate issued the tax demand to Ascotrade relating to the disputed matters, following which the company, on 27th February 2020, filed an appeal with the Provincial Tax Commission of Venice, deeming that valid arguments exist to believe that the conduct of the Company is entirely legitimate. The company, aided by the tax advisor, considers the risk as "possible" or "remote" and therefore has not made any provision.
Territorial areas
In 2011, the issuance of a number of ministerial decrees further defined the regulatory framework of the sector, regarding in particular the territorial calls for tenders. Specifically:
1) the Decree dated 19th January 2011 issued by the Ministry for economic Development in agreement with the Ministry for the Relationship with Regions and Territorial Cohesion, the territorial areas for issuing calls for tenders to entrust the gas distribution service were identified; with subsequent Decree dated 18th December 2011, the municipalities belonging to each territorial area were also identified (the so-called Territorial Areas Decree); 2) the Decree issued by the Ministry for Economic Development and the Ministry of Employment and Social Policies on 21st April 2011 contained provisions ruling the social effects connected to the assignment of the new gas distribution concessions, thus implementing paragraph 6 of art. 28 of Legislative Decree no. 164 issued on 23rd May 2000 (the so-called Workforce Protection Decree); 3) with Decree no. 226 issued by the Ministry for Economic Development on 12th November 2011, the regulatory norms concerning the criteria to be applied to calls for tenders and the evaluation of the offer for assigning the gas distribution service was approved (the so-called Decree for Criteria). The issuance of ministerial decrees played a major role in giving certainty to the competitive environment within which operators will move in the coming years, thus laying the foundations for allowing the process of market opening - that started with the implementation of European directives - to produce the benefits hoped for. The Ascopiave Group - as indeed many other operators - has substantially appreciated the new regulatory framework, believing that it can create important opportunities of investment and development for medium-sized qualified operators, rationalising the offer. At the end of 2013, the Government issued Law Decree 23/12/2013, no. 145, making changes to the regulatory framework with regard to the determination of the reimbursement value of the plants due to the outgoing operator at the end of the so-called "Transitional Period". The Decree was converted with amendments into Law no. 9/2014, which substantially changed the original provisions of the Decree on that aspect. The conversion into Law of the Decree (Law no. 9/2014) has made substantial changes to Article 15 of Legislative Decree no. 164/2000, providing that the new operators shall pay a reimbursement to the holders of assignments and concessions existing in the transitional period, calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts and, even if not inferable by the will of the Parties and for aspects which are not envisaged in those agreements or contracts, based on guidelines on operating criteria and methods for the assessment of the reimbursement value as per article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98. In any case, private contributions related to local assets (assessed in accordance with the methodology of tariff regulation in force) have to be deducted from the reimbursement value. If the reimbursement value is higher than 10% of the value of local assets calculated as per tariff regulation, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, the granting local body submits the related

|34 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

evaluations detailing the reimbursement value to the Authority for Electricity and Gas and Water Supply System so that it can be checked before publishing the invitation to tender. In addition, Law no. 9/2014 has established that the deadlines envisaged in paragraph 3 of article 4 of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98, are extended by four months and that the deadlines illustrated in Attachment 1 to the regulations of the Minister for Economic Development Decree dated 12th November 2011, no. 226 (so-called "Decree for Criteria"), related to dispositions contained in the third grouping of Attachment 1 itself, and the deadlines illustrated in article 3 of the regulations, are extended by four months. On 6th June 2014 the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development dated 22nd May 2014 was published in the Official Gazette, which approved the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree no. 69/2013, converted with amendments by Law no. 98/2013 and article 1, paragraph 16, of Law Decree no. 145/2013, converted with amendments into Law no. 9/2014. Pursuant to Law no. 9/2014, the "Guidelines for criteria and application procedures for the assessment of the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks" define the criteria to be applied to the valuation of reimbursement of facilities in order to integrate those aspects that are not already provided for in the agreements or contracts and what cannot be deduced from the will of the parties. The "Guidelines" feature several critical issues not only as concerns the resulting valuations, but also in terms of application scope, extremely extended by the Ministry, to the extent that all the agreements regarding the valuations of the facilities entered into by the operators and the Municipalities after 12th February 2012 (date of entry into force of Ministerial Decree 226/2011) are believed to be ineffective. Furthermore, these Guidelines contrast with the provisions of art. 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011 itself. This is in non-compliance with the provision of law which refers to art. 4, paragraph 6 of Law Decree 69/2013, which, in turn, makes explicit reference to Article 5 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011. Considering such illegitimacies, Ascopiave S.p.A. has appealed the Ministerial Decree dated 21st May 2014 (and as a consequence the Guidelines) before the administrative court (Regional Administrative Court of Latium). As part of the said proceedings, the issue of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling was raised relating to the interpretation (mainly retrospective) of the new rules on the deduction of private contributions set forth by Law 9/2014. Lastly, by Resolution 310/2014/R/gas - "Provisions for determining the reimbursement value of natural gas distribution networks", published on 27th June 2014, the Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water approved provisions for determining the reimbursement value of the gas distribution networks, implementing the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 16 of Law Decree dated 23rd December 2013, no. 145, converted with amendments by Law dated 21st February 2014, no. 9. That provision states that the granting Local Authority shall send the Authority the verification documents containing a detailed calculation of the reimbursement value (RIV), if this value is 10% higher than the local RAB. The Authority performs the checks set forth in Article 1, paragraph 16 of Law Decree no. 145/13 within 90 days from the date of receipt of the documentation by the Awarding entities, ensuring priority based on the deadlines for the publication of the calls for tender. With Law no. 116/2014 dated 11th August 2014 (converted with amendments to law decree 24th June 2014 no. 91) the Legislator has envisaged a further extension of deadlines for the publication of invitations to tender. Specifically, for the areas belonging to the first group referred to in Annex 1 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011, the time limit was extended by eight months; for the areas belonging to the second, third and fourth groups the deadline was postponed by six months and lastly for the areas of the fifth and sixth groups the extension is four months. However, these postponements do not apply to those areas which, although they belong to the first six groups, are affected by earthquakes, because over 15% of the redelivery points are in the municipalities affected by the earthquakes of 20th and 29th May 2012, in compliance with the annex to the Decree of the Minister of economy and finance dated 1st June 2012. The same law, further amending Article 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 2000, has finally determined that the redemption value is to be calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts, provided that the latter were entered into before the date of entry into force of Ministerial Decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226, that is to say before 12th February 2012, thus affirming the principle of retroactive application of the Guidelines, which had already been appealed during the court action against the Guidelines.

|35 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

On 14th July 2015, the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of Regional Affairs and Autonomies no. 106 dated 20th May 2015 was published in the Official Gazette, amending the decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226 regarding the tender criteria for awarding the gas distribution service. The most significant changes include:
1) the provisions concerning the value of the reimbursement of the plants to be applied in case of absence of specific agreements between the parties occurred before the entry into force of Decree no. 226/2011, which include to a large extent the provisions of the "Guidelines". 2) a higher maximum threshold for the amount of the annual payments that may be offered in tenders to local authorities. This threshold, previously equal to 5% of the portion of the restriction on tariff revenues to cover the local capital costs, has been brought to 10%; 3) the treatment of a number of important technical and economic aspects related to the tendered energy efficiency investments, concerning the value of the amounts to be paid to local authorities and the payments to cover the costs of the operator which implements the interventions and gains the related energy efficiency certificates. Finally, the conversion into Law of the so-called "Decreto Mille Proroghe" (Law no. 21 dated 25/02/2016) provides for a further extension of the deadlines for the publication of invitations to tender. Specifically, for the areas belonging to the first group as described in Annex 1 of Ministerial Decree 226/2011, the deadline is further postponed by 12 months; for the areas belonging to the second group, by 14 months; for those belonging to the third, fourth, and fifth group, by 13 months; for the areas belonging to the sixth and seventh grouping, 9 months; 5 months for the areas of the eighth group. The same regulation establishes the deadlines within which the Regions, or, as a last resort, the Ministry of Economic Development, should intervene, and repeals the penalties previously incurred by the Municipalities for the delay. In 2015-2016, a number of tenders were published for the award of the service with Territorial procedure. Many of them did not follow the procedures required by law, which envisages, among other things, the prior examination by the Authority of the reimbursement amounts of the plants due to outgoing operators as well as the review of the invitation to tender's overall content and annexes before publication. Moreover, most calls are also inconsistent, even significantly, with the instructions contained in the ministerial regulations, also with regard to the criteria for evaluating bids; according to the current regulations, such inconsistencies should be specifically justified by the Awarding Entities. In this context, the standardisation of the tender process envisaged by the law is encountering serious difficulties, to the extent that the procedures may freeze due to a major litigation. The Law dated 4th August 2017 no. 124 (Annual Market and Competition Act) introduced some legislative innovations concerning the natural gas distribution sector. Specifically, article 1, paragraph 93, amends the provisions of article 15, paragraph 5, of legislative decree 164/00, exempting local authorities from the obligation to send detailed assessments to the Authority if all the following conditions are met jointly: - the local tender authority can also certify through a suitable third party that the reimbursement value has been determined by applying the provisions contained in the Guidelines dated 7th April 2014; - the aggregated territorial VIR-RAB gap does not exceed 8%; - the VIR-RAB gap of the individual Municipality does not exceed 20%. Article 1, paragraph 93 states that, if the value of the net fixed assets is not in line with the sector averages according to the definitions of the Authority, the value of the net fixed assets relevant to the calculation of the gap is determined by applying the parametric valuation criteria defined by the Authority (see article 23, paragraph 1, RTDG). Finally, article 1, paragraph 94, states that the Authority, with its own resolutions, shall define simplified procedures for the evaluation of the invitations to tender, applicable in cases where such invitations have been compiled in compliance with the standard invitation to tender, the standard book of conditions and the standard service contract, specifying that in any case, the tender documentation cannot deviate from the maximum scores envisaged for the tender criteria and sub-criteria by articles 13, 14 and 15 of the aforementioned decree 226/11, except within the limits set by the same articles with regard to some sub-criteria. The Authority has implemented the provisions of Law no. 124/2017 with Resolution 905/2017/R/gas dated 27th December 2017.

|36 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The Municipality of Belluno, Awarding Entity of the Minimum Territory Area of Belluno, regularly followed the procedure set out in the regulations and published a tender in December 2016. In September 2017 the Group company AP Reti Gas S.p.A. participated in the tender, submitting its bid. The tender documents were challenged by an operator participating in the call for bids. With Judgement no. 886/2017, the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto rejected the appeal. The plaintiff appealed against the decision to the Council of State, submitting an application for the suspension of the first instance provision. The Council of State, by Judgement published on 22nd January 2019, rejected the appeal. In December 2018, the Municipality of Schio, the contracting authority of the Territorial Area Vicenza 3 - Valli Astico Leogra e Timonchio, issued the invitation to tender for the concession of the gas distribution service. The Ascopiave Group currently manages the service in 28 municipalities in the Territorial Area, serving about 80,000 users. The Group companies, AP Reti Gas S.p.A. and AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A., holders of concessions in the Area, have challenged the call due to irregularities, filing an appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto. On 8th May 2019, the hearing for the discussion of the merits was held, without any novelties.
Distribution of dividends
On 23rd April 2019, the Shareholders' Meeting approved the yearly statement and decided the distribution of an ordinary dividend of Euro 0.125 per share and an extraordinary dividend of Euro 0.2133 per share with dividend date on 6th May 2019, record date on 7th May 2019 and payment on 8th May 2019.
Own shares
Pursuant to Article 40, Legislative Decree 127 2 d), as of 31st December 2019 the value of own shares held by the company is equal to Euro 26,774 thousand (Euro 16,981 thousand as of 31st December 2018), recognised as a reduction in other reserves as can be seen in the Net Equity changes. Ascopiave purchased own shares on the electronic share market starting from 1st April 2019. As of 31st December 2019 Ascopiave S.p.A. held 10,456,025 own shares, equal to 4.461% of the share capital, for the value above. During the first week of July 2019, 7,149,505 treasury shares were assigned to the company Anita S.r.l. as part of the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A., the finalisation of which was announced to the market on 25th June 2019. On 13th March 2020, Ascopiave S.p.A. holds 11,994.605 treasury shares, equal to 5.117% of the share capital.
Outlook for the Year
As far as the gas distribution activities are concerned, in 2020 the Group will continue its normal operations and service management and perform preparatory activities for the invitations to tender, which involve, among other things, updating the estimates of the reimbursement values of the plants currently managed and sharing them with the local authorities, as well as providing the contracting authorities with the data and information required by law. The Group could also prepare bids for participation in the tenders which will be invited for the award of the Minimum Territorial Areas in which it is interested. To date, however, it is not possible to predict which tender procedures will actually be launched. Most Municipalities currently managed belong to Minimum Territorial Areas for which the maximum deadline to issue the call for tenders has expired. Only the contracting authorities in the Territorial areas of Vicenza 3 and Vicenza 4 have published the call, for which the application for participation should be submitted in 2020. If other tender authorities issue calls for tenders in 2020, in the light of the time required to submit bids and evaluate and select them, it is reasonable to assume that possible transfers of management to potential new operators may be executed only after the end of 2020. As regards the economic results, in 2019 the Authority adopted the new tariff regulation for the 2020-2025 five-year period. The new provisions envisage a significant reduction in the revenue components intended to cover operating costs. Due to this resolution, the results of the distribution company are expected to decline in 2020. In this regard,

|37 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

the Group has appealed to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan together with other leading distribution operators. As regards energy efficiency obligations, it is presumable that the economic margin achievable in 2020 will be consistent with that achieved in 2019, due to the effect of the current regulations that control the purchase prices of the certificates and contributions granted.
As regards electricity and gas sales, Ascopiave will obtain the benefits of the consolidation of its quota of the result of the minority stake in Estenergy and the dividends distributed by Hera Comm ­ both companies are controlled by the Hera Group. Ascopiave has put options on these investments and it is possible that they will be exercised, in whole or in part, during the next year, with a consequent impact on the Group's income statement and cash flows.
The actual results of 2020 could differ from those outlined above depending on various factors amongst which: the general macroeconomic conditions, the impact of regulations in the energy and environmental fields, success in the development and application of new technologies, the changes in stakeholder expectations and other changes in business conditions.

Evolution of the COVID 19 emergency
In March 2020, the health emergency caused by Covid-19 involved the entire territory where the Ascopiave Group operates. Since the first signs of the crisis, in February, the Management of the Ascopiave Group has worked hard to effectively handle the emergency in an operational office in Lombardy (Bergamo), the first region to adopt important restrictive measures in some areas. The Management has constantly monitored the evolution of the events, quickly identifying the most appropriate measures to support workers, safety and services, providing all employees with continuous information. After the first case of infection in Italy, on 21st February, which was followed by an urgent meeting of the Council of Ministers on 23rd February for the first important action by the government, on the same day, Sunday 23rd February, at the Group headquarters in Pieve di Soligo, as requested and directed by the Chairman Nicola Cecconato, a specific Crisis Unit was set up to handle the emergency. Its members are shown in the chart below.

The Crisis Unit immediately began working by promoting the implementation of all the precautionary measures issued by the Authorities to avoid contacts between people and disseminating widely in the company offices all the indications released, both for social distancing and for personal hygiene. On the same day and the following ones, the provisions of the Authorities for the protection and health of employees and for the fight against the spread of the virus in the various offices were implemented through: adoption of all of the safety protocols, posting of the behavioural rules issued by the Ministry and the Italian Institute of Health and their diffusion to all workers through specific communications, transmission to all employees of communications,

ordinances and Prime Minister Decrees, implementation of measures for distancing and avoiding the simultaneous presence of staff in offices and in common places, activation of shifts for accessing the canteen with tables and chairs arranged in order to respect distances, initially, then the canteen service was suspended, minimisation of meetings and use of audio- or videoconferences, cancellation of meetings with third parties, consultants and collaborators and exclusion of their presence on site, reduction of all business trips and travels, review of criteria for accessing Group offices (the entrances were closed and access was limited to couriers for deliveries to the warehouse, respecting protocols); rescheduling of operations for all technical, administrative and secretarial areas, strengthening of cleaning services, maximisation of agile work where possible with implementation of technological equipment, promotion of the use of holidays or other possibilities given by collective bargaining tools, increase in purchases of material for personal hygiene, distributed in the various areas, and for cleaning; increase in requests for PPE stocks, more frequent sanitisation of the premises. As regards the distribution activities, operations were rescheduled and the activities were gradually postponed where possible. In particular, all construction sites and operating activities not directly related to the safety and continuity of the service were gradually suspended; all essential services were therefore guaranteed, specifically emergency intervention, facility surveillance and the operations aimed at ensuring the use of the service, such as activations and reactivations of end customers and the creation of connections for the activation of supplies. Together with the competent doctor, the risks deriving from the possible presence of infected or quarantined people were analysed, and the correct precautions to be adopted were identified, which envisage the use of specific personal protective equipment, distributed to all operating personnel. In general, the continuity of the company remains active in all areas, although the employees were encouraged in all ways to leave the workplaces; at the offices, staff can only be present with the authorisation of their manager for emergency reasons. In total, this exodus has involved 98% of the employees of the Pieve di Soligo headquarters (usually around 200 units are present), through the use of work from home for white-collar workers or the decision not to have external distribution personnel work at the headquarters, or through the use of holidays, leaves or other measures. To date, no employee of the Ascopiave Group has tested positive.
In compliance with article 13 of the protocol signed on 15th March 2020 between the Government and the employers' and workers' associations, on 17th March, after reaching an agreement with the company representatives, a so-called Central Committee was established, concerning the Ascopiave Group as a whole, with the main task of evaluating the "Shared protocol for regulating the measures to fight and contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the workplace", and the interventions that may be necessary in consideration of the activity and presence of the Ascopiave Group as a whole. Such Committee is composed of 8 people (4 representing the Company, 4 representing the internal trade unions). Four so-called Local Committees were also convened, relating to the companies AP Reti Gas Nord Est, AP Reti Gas Vicenza, AP Reti Gas Rovigo and Edigas, with the same task as the Central Committee but focused on the individual headquarters, consisting of 2 representatives appointed by the Company and 2 by the trade unions. The meetings are taking place regularly in an atmosphere of maximum cooperation.
Goals and policies of the group and risk description
Credit and liquidity risk The main financial instruments in use by our Group are represented by liquidity, bank debt and other forms of financing. It is maintained that the Group is not exposed to credit risks greater than the product sector average, considering that it provides its business services to a limited number of operators in the gas sector, whose rules for accessing the services offered are established by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment and set out in the Network codes, which dictate contractual clauses that reduce the risks of default by customers. The Codes envisage, in particular, the release of suitable guarantees to partially cover the obligations assumed if the customer does not have a credit rating issued by leading international bodies. To keep residual credit risks under control, there is in any case a bad debt provision equal to approximately 2.7% at the end of the year (4.8% as of 31st December 2018) of the total gross receivables from third parties for invoices issued. Significant commercial operations take place in Italy.

|39 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Regarding the company's financial management, the directors consider that the generation of liquidity, deriving from operations, is suitable for covering its needs.
Risks relating to bids for the award of new concessions for the distribution of gas As of 31st December 2019 the Ascopiave Group holds a portfolio of 268 natural gas distribution concessions (230 as of 31st December 2018; the change in the number of concessions managed is related mainly to the entry in the consolidation scope of the company Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est S.p.A.). In compliance with the regulations in force governing the concessions held by the company, the calls for tenders for the new awards of the gas distribution service will be no longer announced for every single Municipality but exclusively for the territorial areas determined with Ministerial Decrees dated 19th January 2011 and 18th October 2011, and pursuant to the deadlines illustrated in Annex 1 attached to the Ministerial Decree on tender criteria and bid assessment standards, issued on 12th November 2011, and subsequent amendments. With new tenders being launched, Ascopiave S.p.A. may not be able to obtain one or more new concessions, or it could obtain them at less advantageous conditions than the current ones, with possible negative impacts on the operative activity and the economic, equity and financial situation, it being understood that, if the company is not awarded with a new concession, limited to the Municipalities currently managed by the company, it will obtain a reimbursement value envisaged for the outgoing operator.
Risks relating to the amount of reimbursement paid by the new operator With regard to the concessions under which the Ascopiave Group also owns the gas distribution networks, Law no. 9 / 2014 establishes that the new operator shall pay a reimbursement calculated in compliance with the provisions of the agreements or contracts and, even if not inferable by the will of the Parties and for aspects which are not envisaged in those agreements or contracts, based on guidelines on operating criteria and methods for the assessment of the reimbursement value as per article 4, paragraph 6, of Law Decree dated 21st June 2013, no. 69, converted, with amendments, by Law dated 9th August 2013, no. 98. In any case, private contributions related to local assets (assessed in accordance with the methodology of tariff regulation in force) have to be deducted from the reimbursement value. In addition, if the reimbursement value is higher than 10% of the value of local assets calculated as per tariff regulation, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, the granting local body submits the related evaluations detailing the reimbursement value to the Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment so that it can be checked before publishing the invitation to tender. The Minister for Economic Development Decree dated 12th November 2011 no. 226 establishes that the new operator acquires the property of the plant by paying the redemption value to the outgoing operator, except for any portion of it owned by the municipality. In the periods following the first, transitional one, the reimbursement value to the outgoing operator shall be equal to the local net intangible assets, net of public capital contributions and of private ones for local fixed assets, calculated with reference to the criteria used by the Authority to determine the distribution tariffs (RAB). As far as this point is concerned, it should be noted that the Authority has recently intervened with Resolution 367/2014/R/gas, providing that the redemption value, referred to in Article 14, paragraph 8, of Legislative Decree no. 164/00, at the end of the first period of concession is determined as the sum of: a) the residual value of the existing stock at the beginning of the concession period, assessed for all the fixed assets subject to transfer for consideration to the new operator in the second period of concession based on the redemption value, provided for in Article 5 of Decree 226/11, recognised to the outgoing operator in the first territorial concession, taking into account the depreciations and divestments recognised for tariff purposes in the concession period; b) the residual value of the new investments made in the concession period and existing at the end of the period, assessed based on the re-valued historical cost method for the period in which the investments are recognised in the final balance, as provided in Article 56 of the Tariff Regulation of Gas Distribution and Measurement Services (RTDG), and as the average between the net value determined based on the re-valued historical cost method and the net value determined based on standard cost assessment methods, pursuant to paragraph 3.1 of Resolution 573/2013/R/GAS, for the next period.

As of 31st December 2019, the Ascopiave Group had a workforce of 481 employees, divided in the various companies as follows:

Companies consolidated with full consolidation method Ascopiave S.p.A. Ap Reti Gas S.p.A. Ap Reti Gas Rovigo S.r.l. Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione S.p.A. Ap Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A. Ap Reti Nord Est S.p.A. Total companies consolidated with full consolidation method

Compared to 31st December 2018, the workforce of the Ascopiave Group grew by 84 units, mainly due to the entry in the consolidation scope, effective 31st December, of the company Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est, +103 employees. The finalisation of the partnership between Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Hera Group on 19th December 2019 determined the deconsolidation of the group's gas and electricity sales companies. This effect was also reflected in the 2018 data in order to increase comparability and consequently the figures shown for comparison purposes are lower than those included in the financial report of the previous year by 281 units. Furthermore, during the year, subsequent to the merger through acquisition of the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A., and the consequent transfer of the unit merged to Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., the existing employment relationships were transferred with the business units.

Research and Development
During the first half of 2019, the new management software to support the main processes of the Group's Gas Distribution companies was implemented; the programme had been selected through the tender announced in the second half of 2018. The project, one of the most important in the last few years for the Group Gas Distribution companies, saw the go live of all the companies on 1st July, with the simultaneous aggregation project on the same management software of Unigas (subsequent to the transfer of its operating activities to Edigas). As an integral part of the project for the renovation of the management software of the Distribution companies, the hardware architecture was also enhanced both in terms of a new storage, entirely on SSD technology, and new computing capacity. In the second half of the year, the main project concerned the implementation of all the information systems of the new company AP Reti Gas Nord Est, operational from 1st January 2020, which manages gas distribution networks in the provinces of Padua, Udine and Pordenone. The project involved the migration of data from the previous operator's systems for all applications, including the user management system, the accounting and finance system, the human resource management system, the SAC (Central Acquisition System) for electronic metres, cartography systems, the Asset Management system etc.. The project for revamping the works management process of the Distribution companies also continued, implying changes to the processes for estimating, entrusting and accounting for the works and creating ­ if needed - new assets, understood as new constructions and extraordinary maintenance of the gas networks. This project aims to implement application solutions that can automate and make the management of the activities more efficient and effective. During the year, adjustments and changes were made to the current systems in order to comply with the new regulations and improve internal processes. As regards infrastructure, the replacement of the corporate production SAN architectures was completed, located in the two Ascotlc datacentres to manage high reliability. The old production SAN architectures were also recovered to be used in the test/development/pre-production SAN architectures, replacing the very old ones that were in use. The project to migrate corporate PCs from Windows 7 to Windows 10 continued and reached a completion percentage of around 80%. In order to have more computing power, and with a view to technological evolution, the cluster 1 hardware of the production systems was renovated. The old hardware infrastructures of the former company Pasubio Group, now AP Reti Gas Vicenza, were completely dismantled, and the material was disposed of according to company procedures. The refurbishment project of the entire network core infrastructure of the Pieve di Soligo headquarters was completed, improving the speed and reliability of the IT network. As regards corporate software, subsequent to the reorganisation of the information systems, the SAP management support was "taken over" from the previous operators, with the optimisation of the loading flows of XML invoices, the merger of Unigas into Edigas and the configuration of the new company Ap Reti Gas Nord Est. The takeover process also involved the software used to register invoices payable, called "Contabilità Silos", for which the automatic loading processes of the XML files from the SDI and the generation of the TXT file which is subsequently loaded into SAP were improved. For the software that manages vehicles, "WEB CARS", the creation of reports, previously missing, was activated as well as the recovery of the invoice amounts received from the "Contabilità Silos" software. In order to improve the management of reported anomalies or new software requests, the new HDA (Help Desk Advanced) software was configured and launched to support all the group companies.

Additional information
Seasonal nature of the activity Since the execution of the partnership agreement with the Hera Group, finalised on 19th December 2019 with the transfer of the sales companies, the activity of the Ascopiave Group is not significantly affected by seasonality. The natural gas distribution business is in fact less influenced by the thermal trend recorded during the year, except for some minor items. The Group is exposed to the effects of seasonality in relation to investments in associates which will be valued using the equity method and which are significantly exposed to seasonality, as they work in the natural gas sales sector. Gas consumption changes considerably on a seasonal basis, with a greater demand in winter in relation to higher consumptions for heating. This seasonality influences the trend of revenues from gas sales and of procurement costs, while other operating costs are fixed and incurred by the Group in a uniform manner throughout the year. Therefore, the data and the information contained in the interim financial statements do not allow for immediate indications to be drawn regarding the overall performance for the year.
Remuneration of Directors and Auditors, general managers and managers with strategic responsibilities and shares held For further information pertaining to the remuneration of Directors and Auditors, general managers and managers with strategic responsibilities and the shares they hold, please refer to the Remuneration Report drafted pursuant to Art. 123-ter of the Legislative Decree 58/1998 (Consolidated Finance Law), approved by the Board of Directors on 6th March 2020. The aggregated remuneration to Directors, Auditors and Top Executives of the Group in 2019 amounts to Euro 808 thousand for Directors, Euro 152 thousand for Auditors, Euro 670 thousand for Top Executives, and Euro 2,277 thousand related to the positive outcome of the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019, totalling Euro 3,907 thousand, compared to Euro 4,641 thousand in the previous year.
Security of personal data Ascopiave Group is attentive to the protection of personal data and the adoption of appropriate security measures. For a greater protection of these data, the Group also continues to update each year the DPS (Security Planning Document), although it is no longer required under Legislative Decree no. 196 dated 30th June 2003 because of the amendments introduced by Law Decree 9th February 2012, no. 5, converted into Law no. 35 of 4th April 2012. (EU) Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament ("GDPR") introduced significant changes to the legislation for the protection of personal data previously in force, requiring a project for adapting the organisational model and the procedures for processing personal data, which had been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Italian Legislative Decree 196/03. This project, in addition to adapting all the documentation for the collection and management of personal data, involved the definition of a new set of procedures and new organisational roles, such as the appointment of the Data Protection Officer for all Group companies.
Statement pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196 dated 30th June 2003 The Chairman of the Board of Directors, as the Controller of the personal data of the Company, states the adequacy of the Privacy Policy set forth in Legislative Decree no. 196 dated 30th June 2003 and subsequent additions, through the service managed by Ascopiave in its capacity as responsible for the databases, managed either with electronic or nonelectronic systems.
Sustainability The Ascopiave Group's sustainable business model is illustrated in the Consolidated Non-financial Disclosure pursuant to articles 3 and 4 of Legislative Decree no. 254 of 2016, contained in the 2019 Financial Report.

Comments on the economic-financial results of the year 2019
Performance indicators According to Consob communication DEM 6064293 dated 28th July 2006 and by recommendation CESR/05-178b on alternative performance indicators, we specify that besides the normal performance indicators set by the International Accounting Standards IAS/IFRS, the Group considers useful for monitoring its business, the use of other performance indicators, which, even if they do not appear in the afore-stated standards, have a considerable importance. In particular, we introduced the following indicators: - Gross operating margin (Ebitda): defined by the Group as the result of amortisation and depreciation, write-
downs of receivables, financial management and taxes. - Operating result: this indicator is also included in the accounting principles we have adopted, and it is defined as
the operating margin (Ebit) minus the balance of costs and non-recurrent revenues. The latter includes extraordinary incomes and losses, capital gains and losses for disposal of assets, insurance reimbursements, contributions and other less relevant positive and negative components. - Tariff revenues from gas distribution: defined by the Group as the amount of revenue realised by the distribution companies of the Group for the application of tariffs for distribution and measurement of natural gas to their end customers, net of the equalisation amounts managed by Cassa per i Servizi energetici e Ambientali.

Comments on the trend of the main operational indicators of the Group's activity are reported below. The value of each indicator is obtained by adding the values of the indicators of each consolidated company, weighting the data of the companies consolidated with the equity method according to the share of consolidation. Furthermore, subsequent to the completion of the partnership with the Hera Group on 19th December 2019, the operating data of the Group's sales companies were reclassified pursuant to IFRS 5.
As far as the activity of gas distribution is concerned, in 2019 the volumes distributed through the networks managed by the fully consolidated companies of the Group totalled 1,107.1 million cubic metres, up 1.9% compared to the same period in the previous year, a change partly affected by the line-by-line consolidation of the company Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. commencing 1st July 2019. As of 31st December 2019 the number of redelivery points (PDR) managed by the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis was 777.3 thousand and showed an increase of 239.3 thousand units compared to the previous year, mainly explained by the line-by-line consolidation of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. and the entry in the consolidation scope of the company Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est S.p.A..

The increase in turnover is mainly due to the extension of the scope of consolidation as a result of the merger through acquisition of the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., previously consolidated using the equity method. The merger, effective

| 47 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

1st July 2019, resulted in the recognition of the revenues achieved during the second half of the year by the distribution business unit managed by the company, mainly affecting the revenues from transport services and contributions for energy efficiency certificates.
The tariff revenues from gas distribution (from Euro 73.940 thousand to Euro 80,370 thousand) increased by Euro 6,430 thousand compared to the previous year, mainly due to the extension of the consolidation scope.
The revenues from energy efficiency certificates (from Euro 25,253 thousand to Euro 29,176 thousand) increase by Euro 3,923 thousand compared to the previous year, also due to the extension of the consolidation scope.
The operating result in 2019 amounted to Euro 21,573 thousand, up Euro 507 thousand (+2.4%) compared to the previous year.
The improvement is due to several factors: - increase in the tariff revenues on the activity of gas distribution for Euro 6,430 thousand; - lower margin on energy efficiency certificates for Euro 4,043 thousand; - negative change in other items of cost and revenues, equal to Euro 1,906 thousand.
The negative change in other items of cost and revenues, equal to Euro 1,906 thousand, is due to: - lower other revenues for Euro 855 thousand, mainly connected to the decrease in contributions for parcelling for Euro 778 thousand; - higher material and service costs and other charges equalling Euro 293 thousand; - lower staff costs for Euro 1,625 thousand, mainly explained by the amounts disbursed in 2018 to strategic executives who ceased their employment relationship with the Parent Company (Euro 2,411 thousand). This positive effect was partially offset by the expansion of the scope of consolidation which led to the recognition of the personnel costs of Unigas starting from the date of the merger, by an increase in the costs recorded for long-term incentive plans and lower capitalisations; - an increase in amortisation and depreciation of fixed assets for Euro 2,399 thousand, mainly connected to the extension of the consolidation scope.
The net consolidated profit in 2019 amounts to Euro 14,479 thousand, down Euro 248 thousand (-1.7%) compared to the previous year. This change is due to the following factors:
- increase in the operating result, as previously stated, for Euro 507 thousand; - lower result of companies consolidated through the equity method for Euro 759 thousand, due to the inclusion in the
consolidation scope of Unigas Distribuzione effective 1st July 2019; - decrease in financial revenues for Euro 5 thousand; - increase in financial charges for Euro 99 thousand; - decrease in taxes for Euro 108 thousand, due to the lower taxable income in the period in question.
The tax rate, calculated by normalising the pre-tax result of the effects of consolidation of the companies consolidated using the equity method, decreases from 33.6% in 2018 to 32.4%.
The overall result of the Group amounted to Euro 493,216 thousand, recording an increase of Euro 446,717 thousand compared to the previous year (Euro 44,625 thousand as of 31st December 2018), and was influenced by assets sold for Euro 478,737 thousand (Euro 31,773 thousand as of 31st December 2018).

In compliance with the international accounting standard IFRS 5, the economic results achieved by the companies involved in the partnership finalised with the Hera Group on 19th December 2019, and better described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" of this financial report, or related to its implementation, were reclassified under the item. The item includes the gross capital gain generated by the sale of the investments in the companies involved in the partnership, and the costs incurred for the completion of the transaction, accompanied by the related tax effect. This effect was further influenced by the results achieved by the sales companies during the period in question, up to the date on which their control was transferred, and by the dividends that they distributed to the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A. in May 2019.

General operational performance ­ The economic results of the Group companies sold
According to Consob communication DEM 6064293 dated 28th July 2006 and by recommendation CESR/05-178b on alternative performance indicators, we specify that besides the normal performance indicators set by the International Accounting Standards IAS/IFRS, the Group considers useful for monitoring its business, the use of other performance indicators, which, even if they do not appear in the afore-stated standards, have a considerable importance. In particular, we introduced the following indicators: - Gross operating margin (Ebitda): defined by the Group as the result of amortisation and depreciation, write-downs of
receivables, financial management and taxes; - Operating result: this indicator is also included in the accounting principles we have adopted, and it is defined as the
operating margin (Ebit) minus the balance of costs and non-recurrent revenues. The latter includes extraordinary incomes and losses, capital gains and losses for disposal of assets, insurance reimbursements, contributions and other less relevant positive and negative components. - First margin on gas sales: the Group defines it as the amount obtained from the difference between the sales proceeds (realised by the Group's sale companies towards end market customers or from wholesale) and the sum of the following costs: the cost of the carriage service (gross of amounts subject to elimination; consisting in the distribution tariffs applied by the distribution companies) and the cost of purchase of gas sold; - First margin on electricity sale: the Group defines it as the amount obtained from the difference between the proceeds of electricity sales and the sum of the following costs: cost of transportation, dispatching and balancing services and cost of purchase of electricity sold.

In 2019, the income of the divested companies amounted to Euro 582,838 thousand, marking an increase of 1.8% compared to the previous year.
The gross operating margin achieved during the year amounts to Euro 42,734 thousand, recording an increase of Euro 6,599 thousand, mainly attributable to the higher margins achieved by the sales of natural gas and electricity. The increase in the first margin on gas sales was significantly influenced by the effects of the so-called gas settlement, which had negatively affected the gas margins of 2018, whereas it had an opposite effect in the year in question. The increase in the first margin on electricity sales is mainly explained by the greater quantities of energy sold related to the simultaneous increase in customers. The margins achieved by the sales of raw materials recorded an overall increase of Euro 5,787 thousand. Operating costs contributed to the increase in the gross operating margin, recording a decrease of Euro 812 thousand compared to the previous year.
The operating result of the divested companies at the end of 2019 amounted to Euro 38,653 thousand, up Euro 4,830 thousand (+14.3%) compared to the previous year. The improvement is due to the increase in the gross operating margin of Euro 6,599 thousand described above, which was partially offset by the greater allowance for doubtful accounts made at the end of the year totalling Euro 1,942 thousand.
The pre-tax result shows a change of Euro 4,737 thousand, mainly explained by the operating result. The other items represented by financial income and expenses, as well as by the results achieved by the companies which were consolidated using the equity method, showed a minor change. The tax rate of the divested companies, calculated by normalising the pre-tax result of the effects of consolidation of the companies consolidated using the equity method, decreases from 28.1% in 2018 to 27.7%.

The cash flow generated by operations (letters a + b), equal to Euro 47,108 thousand, was mainly due to self-financing for Euro 516,055 thousand and other financial negative variations amounting to Euro 468,948 thousand mainly related to the capital gains generated by the sale of the equity investments in the sales companies as part of the partnership with the Hera Group for Euro 488,394 thousand and the management of the net circulating capital for Euro 19.073 thousand. The assessment of companies consolidated through the equity method generated negative financial changes for Euro -648 thousand. The management of net circulating capital generated financial resources amounting to Euro 19,073 thousand and was influenced mainly by the positive variation in the net operating capital which generated financial resources for Euro 9,981 thousand and the variation in the position towards the Inland Revenue for the accrual of IRES and IRAP taxes for Euro 6,836 thousand.

Investment activities generated a net cash requirement of Euro 47,715 thousand, of which Euro 34,440 thousand in tangible and intangible assets, mainly for works and developments of natural gas distribution facilities (Euro 31,431 thousand). The investments made for the acquisition of stakes are related to the merger through acquisition of the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., effective 1st July, and the partnership finalised with the Hera Group on 19th December 2019. The merger through acquisition absorbed financial resources equal to Euro 12,583 thousand related to the book value of the treasury shares assigned to the shareholder with which the Parent Company held joint control of the company until the effective date of the merger. The partnership generated a negative net financial flow of Euro 1,729 thousand as the net balance of flows which were positive for Euro 616,214 thousand, deriving from the sale of the stakes held in the companies operating in the segment of gas and energy sales to EstEnergy and Hera Comm, and a flow which was negative for Euro 617,943 thousand, related to the

| 52 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

purchase of 100% of Ap Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l., of the 48% stake in the new company EstEnergy, and the 3% stake in Hera Comm. Additional variations in the Net financial position concern dividends received from the companies consolidated with the equity method, which generated resources for Euro 2,311 thousand and dividends received from the companies under the partnership for Euro 28,7876 thousand, and the distribution of dividends for Euro 76,924 thousand. During the year, Ascopiave S.p.A. purchased treasury shares on the electronic share market, generating a financial requirement of Euro 22,376 thousand, partly offset by the amount used for the merger of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. described above. The flows used for the distribution of dividends were higher than in the previous year due to the extraordinary dividend approved by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 23rd April 2019.

General operational performance ­ Investments
During the year, the Group made investments in tangible and intangible assets for Euro 34,401 thousand, an increase as compared to the same period in the previous year of Euro 4,936 thousand. The increase is explained by higher costs incurred for the construction of natural gas distribution facilities (Euro +3,621 thousand) and the increase in other investments (Euro +1,315 thousand). The costs incurred for the construction of infrastructures for the distribution of natural gas, amounting to Euro 31,431 thousand, were connected to the construction and maintenance of natural gas network and distribution systems for Euro 11,356 thousand, the creation of connections for Euro 7,876 thousand and the installation of metres for Euro 9,420 thousand. The other investments made during the year mainly concerned the replacement of the user management system employed by the Group's distribution companies and the development of software for the design, monitoring, development and reporting of the investments made. Investments in hardware and software consequently recorded an increase of Euro 1,380 thousand.

2019
Prepared in accordance with Italian Legislative Decree no. 254/2016
| 56 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Message from the Chairman
The Non-Financial Annual Disclosure, in addition to being a mandatory requirement for companies of a certain size, is also an informative tool regarding aspects relating to social issues, staff, respect for human rights, the fight against active and passive bribery, and the environment, which are considered relevant on the basis of the company's activities and characteristics. The Ascopiave Group has always shown strong sensitivity in providing all the information necessary to understand the business model for managing and organising the company's activities also as concerns the management of the aforementioned aspects. In addition to non-financial indicators, the Disclosure also illustrates the policies adopted by the company and the effects achieved. All the above enables us to testify how fundamental it is for our Group to measure its results, in terms of performance and impacts produced, to set sustainability objectives integrated in the Business Plan and, ultimately, to offer transparency to our stakeholders, identifying opportunities for continuous improvement in terms of environmental and social quality as well as the role played for the territory.
The Chairman Nicola Cecconato
| 57 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Comment on the methods adopted
This document of the Ascopiave Group (hereinafter also referred to as "Ascopiave", the "Ascopiave Group" or the "Group") constitutes the consolidated non-financial disclosure (hereinafter also referred to as "Non-Financial Disclosure" or "NFD") prepared in accordance with Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 and the amendments dictated by Law no. 145 published in the Official Gazette on 30th December 2018.
The document herein illustrates all the elements needed to ensure the understanding of the Group's business, its performance and results and the impact exerted on the issues considered relevant and set forth in Article 3 of Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 for the year 2019 (from 1st January to 31st December).
The aspects which are relevant to the Group and its stakeholders were defined on the basis of a structured materiality analysis process. Such analysis was updated during the reporting period, taking into account the assessments of the top management and a selection of internal and external stakeholders (directors, employees, suppliers and some municipalities that are shareholders of Asco Holding S.p.A.).
The system for detecting the fundamental performance indicators has been implemented according to the principles «GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards», published in 2016 by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), according to the "Core" option. Additionally, the "Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures" published by Global Reporting Initiative in 2013 have been taken into consideration.
The scope of the data and information on operating results and cash flows is the same as the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ascopiave Group as at 31st December 2019. The scope of the social and environmental data and information extends over the companies belonging to the Ascopiave Group as at 31st December 2019 which are consolidated on a line-by-line basis within the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.
With regard to the significant changes in the ownership structure that occurred during 2019, please refer to the Report on operations for details of the changes that occurred within the Group companies. In order to compare data over time and assess the performance of the Group's activities, also in light of the extraordinary operations performed in the reporting period, a comparison with the previous year is provided, illustrating the data approved last year and adding a column (called "2018 Restated") which presents the restatement of the data shown for comparative purposes. The staff figures as at 31st December 2019 presented in this document also consider the employees of the company Ap Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l. who joined the Ascopiave Group on the same day. Furthermore, the data relating to the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., merged through acquisition into Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. on 1st July 2019, were also included.
In order to give a fair representation of performance and ensure the reliability of data, we have minimised the use of estimates which, if any, are however based on the best available methodologies which are properly reported.
In order to prepare the Non-financial disclosure and collect non-financial data and information in a timely manner, the Group has adopted a reporting procedure, so as to guarantee the adoption of standardised methods for reporting and the implementation of an adequate internal control system at the Parent Company and the Subsidiaries, for the reporting year and future years.
The Ascopiave Group has undertaken a process of continuous improvement as concerns the issues and policies implemented with a view to reducing its environmental impact, developing social and personnel policies, protecting human rights along the entire supply chain and committing constantly to the fight against active and passive bribery. During 2020, a Group Sustainability Strategic Plan will be defined, in order to integrate a sustainability strategy into the business and the company processes with specific targets.
In order to better monitor the risks associated with sustainability issues, the Group is carrying out a first ESG risk analysis connected to the material issues that emerged from the new materiality analysis. The Group also undertakes to gradually
| 58 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

expand and improve such risk analysis, also in light of the new corporate structure, focusing on the core business of gas distribution.
FIGHT AGAINST ACTIVE AND PASSIVE BRIBERY
This issue is already monitored within the 231/01 Organisation Model adopted by the Parent Company and by the Subsidiaries, and the Group's Code of Ethics. In 2019, the Ascopiave Group started a process for updating the 231 Models of the Parent Company Ascopiave and its subsidiaries, and approved the "Ascopiave Group Whistleblowing Procedure".
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
In February 2018, the Parent Company adopted an integrated Quality, Environment and Safety policy with the aim of formalising the principles set out in the international standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. This policy had already been implemented by the subsidiaries AP Reti Gas S.p.A. and AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A.. The Group undertakes to implement this policy with a view to continuous commitment and improvement towards verifiable objectives ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and the protection of the environment and its employee. As far as Climate Change and the consequent impacts are concerned, the Group undertakes to integrate in the future reports its analyses - and consequently its disclosure - on the impact generated and suffered by the Group as regards Climate Change, also on the basis of the evolution of the relevant legislation.
With regard to staff aspects, in light of the transaction between Ascopiave and the Hera Group completed on 19th December 2019, we announce that the agreements signed included, with reference to the companies involved in the transaction, guarantees for the benefit of employees, in order to maintain the current employment level and the workplace. No particular critical issues emerged regarding relations with trade unions, testifying to the successful management of the operation.
As regards respect for human rights, given the operational and regulatory context in which Ascopiave operates, the topic is relevant to the Group in that it maintains relations with its employees and suppliers, in compliance with the principles and values stated in the Group's Code of Ethics. Considering the specific business sector, the Group's activities do not entail significant water consumption; for this reason, while ensuring adequate understanding of the company's business, the information stated in art. 3, paragraph 2 of Decree 254, is not reported in this document.
Ascopiave's Non-Financial Disclosure is compiled annually: this 2019 NFD was approved by the Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A. on 13th March 2020.
The Report was also subject to a limited audit ("limited assurance engagement" according to the principles stated in the ISAE 3000 Revised standard) by PwC which, at the end of the examination performed, issued a specific report on the compliance of the information provided in the Consolidated Non-Financial Disclosure prepared by Ascopiave pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree no. 254/16.
The NFD is an integral part of the Report on Operations, published in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website www.gruppoascopiave.it.

to comply with the requirements of the specific regulations on the matter, but also to take action aimed at continuously

improving the working conditions, promoting the integration of safety in all company activities and the accountability of the

personnel.

·

Continuous improvement

The Ascopiave Group believes that the continuous improvement of processes and systems is a necessary condition for the

establishment and growth of the company in a competitive context and for meeting the needs of stakeholders. The continuous

improvement process, i.e. the identification of areas for improvement and the definition of measurable parameters and

objectives, is also implemented through the application of international certification standards on quality, safety and the

environment.

·

Respect and personal development of people

The Ascopiave Group, aware that the main key to success of each company consists in human resources, promotes the

involvement of staff in achieving the company's strategic objectives and recognises the professional contribution of everyone,

in a context of loyalty, mutual trust and cooperation, enhancing professional skills through training and growth.

·

Innovation and change

The Ascopiave Group operates in an ever-changing socio-economic context, where innovation and change become fundamental

aspects to face the challenges of the market in the name of efficiency and competitiveness.

·

Sustainable development and cooperation with the community

All the activities of the Ascopiave Group are performed in the awareness of social responsibility towards stakeholders:

employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities, business and financial partners, institutions, professional

associations and trade union representatives. The Ascopiave Group therefore adopts a growth model aimed both at increasing

the economic value of the company and achieving sustainable development.

Parent company's Governance
The system and the rules for the management and control of the company are the backbone of Ascopiave Group's business model and, together with the business strategy, are aimed at supporting the relationship of trust between the company and its stakeholders, contributing to the achievement of the operating results and creating sustainable value in the long run. Transparency and fairness are the guiding principles for the Ascopiave Group upon defining its own Corporate Governance system, which is structured based on the general and special legislation in force, the Articles of Association, the Code of Ethics and the applicable best practices.
A Governance system structured in this way is capable of providing the best response to the challenges coming from the sector and the local context, thus allowing an open and transparent dialogue with the Local Entities. Ascopiave S.p.A. adopts a "traditional" Governance system that is characterised by the presence of the following corporate bodies:
· Shareholders' Meeting, which makes decisions on the supreme acts of governance of the company; · Board of Directors, in charge of managing the company by assigning operational powers to appointed bodies and
individuals; · Chairperson and Managing Director: in addition to being the legal representative and having the powers established

231 Model and Code of ethics
The Ascopiave Group has adopted the 231 Model aimed at ensuring that corporate officers at all levels of the organisation do not engage in illicit conducts in the interest or for the benefit of the Company.
The Code of Ethics of the Ascopiave Group, an integral part of the 231 Model, states that all activities must be carried out in compliance with the law and in accordance with the principles of fair competition, honesty, integrity, fairness and good faith, respecting the legitimate interests of customers, employees, shareholders, business and financial partners and the communities in which the company conducts its activities.
The Model is periodically updated in order to reflect regulatory and jurisprudential developments and better respond to the company's organisational changes; this further guarantees the efficiency and transparency of the company's activities.
During 2019, the Ascopiave Group started a process for updating the 231 Models of the parent company Ascopiave and the subsidiaries.
Specifically, the Model of the parent company Ascopiave was approved by the Board of Directors during the meeting held on 5th August 2019. In addition to updating the predicate offences, the text was simplified, for the sake of understanding and application, also by making explicit, both as regards the general part and the individual special parts, the main and mandatory obligations and/or prohibitions for all those who act and/or interface with Ascopiave and the Group companies, highlighting, in particular, the duty to submit alerts in the presence of potential violations or non-conformities, even if only alleged.

| 63 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

During 2019, the Company, in compliance with Law dated 30th November 2017, no. 179, also approved the "Ascopiave Group Whistleblowing Procedure" (adopted by all Group companies), annex 3 to the Model, with the aim of governing the procedure of receipt, analysis and processing of the Alerts, even transmitted anonymously or confidentially, relating to violations and/or critical issues connected to one or more of the following issues:
· Code of ethics; · 231 Model; · Procedures relating to and/or explaining the Code of Ethics or 231 Model; · Internal Control and Risk Management System; · Laws, regulations, or provisions of Public Authorities
Ascopiave therefore decided to extend the scope of the aforementioned Procedure beyond Legislative Decree 231/2001, deeming it a valid and effective tool for general verification and control, to safeguard the legality that must inspire the actions of the Company, and therefore of directors, employees, collaborators, consultants and suppliers, as well as, in general, anyone who is called to act and/or work for or on behalf of Ascopiave.
The Procedure protects whistle-blowers, within the limit of bad faith or unfounded alerts for gross negligence.
It envisages three main contact channels (letter, dedicated e-mail box and web platform) and assigns the management of alerts to an "Alert Committee"(composed of (i) Head of the Internal Auditing function, (ii) Director of Legal and Corporate Affairs (iii) the Supervisory Board of Ascopiave S.p.A.), in close cooperation with the Supervisory Boards of the individual Group companies.
The Procedure, however, does not modify, nor otherwise limits, or binds the prerogatives and autonomy assigned, by the law and/or the internal procedures, to the Boards of Auditors, and/or to the Supervisory Boards and/or the other Control bodies of Ascopiave and the Group companies. The respective contacts complement and do not replace those (already in force) of the Supervisory Boards.
The Code of Ethics of the Ascopiave Group, approved by the Board of Directors on 14th March 2013, states, among other things, that company assets and, in particular, IT and network resources may not be used under any circumstances for purposes contrary to mandatory rules of law, public order or morality, as well as in order to commit crimes, such as child pornography, or incite the commission of crimes or racial hatred, exalt violence or the violation of human rights.
With regard to respect for and development of people, the Code of Ethics makes explicit and reaffirms the prohibition of any form of discrimination and in particular any discrimination based on race, nationality, gender, age, physical disability, sexual orientation, political or trade union opinions, philosophical views or religious beliefs. Ascopiave and the Group companies undertake to avoid and prosecute any type of harassment in the workplace, interpreting their entrepreneurial role both as the protection of working conditions and the protection of the psycho-physical integrity of the worker, respecting his/her moral personality, avoiding that the latter suffers illicit conditioning or unjustified nuisance.
Compliance with privacy legislation
The Ascopiave Group, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the "data subjects" (such as end customers, employees, collaborators, suppliers and private citizens in general), pays utmost attention to compliance with the privacy legislation, as most recently defined, pursuant to EU Regulation 2016/679 (or GDPR) and Italian Legislative Decree dated 30th June 2003 no. 196, as amended by Legislative Decree 101/2018 (so-called "Privacy Regulation").
Ascopiave, together with the other Group companies, has adopted, first of all, its own "General" Privacy Policy, which can be consulted in the dedicated sections of the website of each Group company, aimed at governing the management structure created to comply with the Privacy Regulation. Specifically, the Privacy Policy contains:
- the definitions and general principles regarding Privacy;
- the roles, responsibilities and appointments of the figures relating to the management of issues related to the Privacy Regulation;
- the rights granted to the data subjects, whose data are processed, with limitations on their transfer;
| 64 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

- the principles, obligations, general rules and guidelines for data processing and document management. The Policy envisages the following management structure, defining the roles of each figure involved:

Controller

DPO (Data Protection Officer)
Privacy Officer

Privacy Delegate

Processor

Area Manager authorized to process personal data (Focal Point)

System Administrator

Employee authorized to process personal
data

Video surveillance Administrator

Ascopiave, like the subsidiaries, pursuant to the GDPR, has also appointed the Data Protection Officer - DPO. In exercising his/her functions, the DPO is independent of the operational functions and has been provided with the human and financial resources necessary for the fulfilment of his/her duties.
Internal coordination is ensured by the Group's "Privacy Function", a collegial body (made up of the Privacy Officer, Ascopiave's Privacy Delegate and DPO), which combines the duties typical of the fulfilment of the obligations and procedures connected with the application of the Privacy Regulation, with duties typical of control and verification of management performance.
In order to guarantee the necessary connection with the individual activities related to the core business conducted by the individual companies, some "Focal Points" were also identified, that is, persons designated (and appointed) by each Group company, who, by virtue of their strategic role within the individual organisations, in addition to the typical duties of each "Person authorised to process personal data", in their respective scopes, are called to: (1) oversee projects and activities that have and/or may have an impact on Personal Data (e.g. need to start a new Processing or need to modify or integrate an existing Processing), (2) assess privacy aspects, (3) constantly inform and, if applicable, timely alert the Privacy Function on the progress of activities affecting Privacy and on the most important situations (as regards specifically possible cases of Data Breach).
Subsequent to the adoption of the Privacy Policy, Ascopiave and the other Group companies, consistent with the provisions of the GDPR and in order to complement the internal regulations, also prepared and adopted the detailed Policies, dedicated, respectively, to:
a. Management of requests from data subjects related to the exercise of the rights stated in EU Regulation 2016/679;
b. Privacy By Design;
c. Data Breach;
d. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA);
e. Data Retention.

Possible risk factors associated with sustainability issues
The Ascopiave Group continuously monitors and manages the main potential risks to which it could be exposed, for each corporate function.
As regards sustainability risks, specifically, the Group is implementing an initial analysis of ESG risks, primarily by examining the material issues with the highest score that emerged from the new materiality analysis and the respective existing controls and management methods.
In particular, the main risk factors associated with the sustainability issues are reported below: · Governance and compliance risks: Risks related to possible errors and/or frauds that may be committed; risks related to failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the Group. · Economic and business responsibility: market and strategic risks, or risks relating to general macroeconomic trends and/or trends specific to the markets in which the Group operates; risks associated with failure to meet any target for the supply of innovative energy services due to the presence of competitors which are already well-established in the target sectors and changes in the market scenario, risks of failure to implement national decarbonisation programmes, difficulties of the Group in dealing with growth and investment strategies, risks related to geopolitical imbalances and changes in consumer choices by the end users. · Responsibility towards human resources: risks associated with the failure to develop talents and their retention; risks relating to the health and safety of workers, connected to possible accidents and occupational diseases that involve the personnel working at the offices and at the operating sites; risks of discrimination against people and lack of respect for diversity and human rights. · Customer accountability: risks associated with any downtimes of the plants and network infrastructures, malfunctions, misalignments or temporary unavailability of the information systems dedicated to Customer Relationship Management (CRM), possible risks connected with the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information. · Environmental risks: risks associated with failure to comply with current and future environmental legislation. · Climate change risks: risks associated with damage to infrastructures caused by extreme environmental events, risks associated with the drop in demand subsequent to the rise in average temperatures due to Global Warming. · Risks towards the territory and the local community: risks of an indirect nature linked to the performance of the Group; reputational and image risk; risk of failure to communicate with the target audience.
Subsequent to the analysis, the existing prevention measures for each material issue have been identified, reinforcing the progressive inclusion of social responsibility in the Group's managerial and strategic spheres.
The Group undertakes to manage effectively the risk factors listed above, implementing any procedures and systems designed to prevent any critical issues with the objective of protecting and increasing its value over time and generating further value for its stakeholders.
Specifically, the Group has adopted the following tools for controlling risks, some of which have been recently implemented:
· 231 Model: Ascopiave S.p.A. and all the subsidiaries have adopted an Organisation, Management and Control Model, pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree dated 8th June 2001 no. 231, updated in 2019, whose purpose, among other things, is to set up a prevention and control system aimed at reducing the risk of committing offenses relevant to the company's activities; the 231 Model contains a specific section dedicated to crimes against workplace health and safety, environmental crimes and computer crimes and illicit data processing.
For further information on the 231 Model adopted by the Ascopiave Group, please refer to the "Corporate Governance" section of the website www.gruppoascopiave.it.
· Code of Ethics: The Code of Ethics of the Ascopiave Group, which is an integral part of the 231 Model, is a tool for defining the set of corporate ethical values that Ascopiave S.p.A. recognises, accepts and embraces, and the set of responsibilities it assumes upon maintaining internal and external relations. The Code of Ethics states that all the employees of the Ascopiave Group are required, within the scope of their functions, to participate in the process of
| 66 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

risk prevention, environmental protection and protection of their own health and safety and those of their colleagues and third parties. The subsidiaries have adopted the Parent Company's Code of Ethics and commit to disseminating the values thereof to their employees.
For further information on the Ascopiave Group's Code of Ethics, please refer to the "Corporate Governance" section of the website www.gruppoascopiave.it.
· Ascopiave Group Whistleblowing Procedure: in 2019 the Group adopted the procedure that governs the process of receipt, analysis and processing of alerts, through the dedicated reporting channels, ensuring the confidentiality of the whistle-blower. The procedure is aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of the alert system, promoting the corporate culture on the matter and ensuring that appropriate actions are taken, including penalties, and that all the measures necessary to avoid their recurrence are operational.
For further information on the Ascopiave Group Whistleblowing Procedure, see the paragraph "231 Model and Code of Ethics" herein and the "Corporate Governance" section of the website www.gruppoascopiave.it.
· Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis: in light of the new corporate structure and the importance of involving and communicating with stakeholders, at the end of 2019 the Group performed an engagement activity with its main stakeholders, which enabled the new materiality analysis. The analysis highlighted the material issues for the Group, the correct monitoring of which ensures proper risk management and a guide for defining corporate strategies.
· Privacy Policy: the Group has implemented a series of measures aimed at adapting the organisational structure to the current legislation on privacy, as stated in the dedicated procedure, which can be consulted in the dedicated sections of the institutional websites of each Group company.
For further information on the Ascopiave Group's Privacy Policy, see the paragraph "Compliance with privacy legislation" herein and the dedicated section of the website www.gruppoascopiave.it.
· Training: aware of the importance of enhancing and developing the skills of its resources, the Group has implemented a new system for planning and reporting training, which will become fully operational in 2020.
· Health and Safety Management System, (as stated in the Integrated Quality, Environment and Safety Policy) in compliance with the standard BS OHSAS 18001, common to the parent company and certified subsidiaries (Ascopiave, AP Reti Gas and AP Reti Gas Vicenza are BS OHSAS 18001 certified, while the other distribution companies have adopted practices and procedures in compliance with Italian Legislative Decree 81/08). It defines the workplace health and safety management model. The system is intended as a guide and a tool to keep under control risks and legal obligations and to monitor and verify periodically and systematically the company's compliance and the improvement objectives. The model is aimed at guaranteeing legislative compliance, keeping workplace risks at levels considered acceptable or compliant with legal limits and reducing the level of risk in equal working conditions. The Group also monitors the accidents of workers of third-party companies that occurred at sites under the responsibility of the Ascopiave Group; in fact, according to the provisions of the Contract Conditions, the contractors of "open" contracts for network connections, maintenance and expansion must provide statistics on accidents on a yearly basis.
· "Financial risk management and control policy" which aims to identify and manage the risks associated with financial management, such as interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity risk.
· Emergency and gas accident management plan: defines the operational procedures to be adopted during an emergency and upon managing emergencies and accidents, in order to avoid the occurrence of risks for public safety and users, as well as to ensure continuity of services.
· Integrated Quality and Environment Management System (as stated in the Integrated Quality, Environment and Safety Policy) compliant with the standards ISO 14001 and ISO 9001, common to the parent company and the certified
| 67 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

subsidiaries: Ascopiave, AP Reti Gas and AP Reti Gas Vicenza. The Environmental System adopted envisages a practice for identifying, assessing and rating the environmental aspects and impacts related to Ascopiave and the ISO 14001 certified companies: this analysis allows each company to formalise an "Environmental Analysis" document and a "Register of environmental impacts". These documents are periodically updated also through the regular evaluation of specific monitoring indicators, essential for the management and continuous improvement of potential significant risks and opportunities.
· Sponsorships and investments for the community: the Group supports projects and initiatives proposed by the Municipalities or associations in the social, cultural and sports fields, for public health prevention and promotion and support during emergency situations; in order to disburse contributions for commercial initiatives having a social impact in an impartial manner, the Group uses the internal Policy, according to which each company is required to report quarterly to the parent company the sponsorships activated.
Sustainability management system and technological innovation
Continuous improvement of processes and systems
Continuous improvement is a necessary condition, both for the company's success and growth in a competitive environment, and for the qualification of the institutional image and the fulfilment of the emerging needs of the stakeholders. All this is achieved through the identification of areas for improvement, the definition of measurable benchmarks and objectives and the timely application of the international standards for quality, safety, environmental and energy service certifications.
Certifications The Ascopiave Group has decided to incorporate aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability into its strategies and activities, according to a progressive and organic process, consistent with the organisation's business objectives. With these decisions, the Group intends to make apparent an inclination towards sustainability that has always distinguished the Company. In fact, since its foundation, Ascopiave has paid increasing attention to aspects such as:  Quality, reliability, security and accessibility to services for end customers and the community;  Implementation of initiatives addressed to employees on the issues of health and safety, organisational climate and
training;  Respect for the community and promotion of initiatives for the benefit of the local community;  Protection of the environment and energy resources;  Search for cutting-edge solutions aimed at strengthening the economic system in favour of the entire community, through
investments in infrastructure and innovative projects.
The Certifications of the Management Systems, progressively acquired and maintained, attest to the existence of a reliable and structured internal system, which allows us to supervise and manage in the best way the quality of the services provided, health and safety at work and the protection of the environment. Testifying to its on-going commitment, as of 31st December 2019 the Ascopiave Group had the following types of system certifications:  ISO 9001:2015 - Quality Management System: it ensures the improvement of the quality standard over time and of the
reliability of the Group towards its customers;  BS OHSAS 18001:2007 ­ Occupational Health and Safety Management System: certifies compliance with the Occupational
Health and Safety requirements and allows the continuous assessment of risks and the improvement of the organisation's performance;  ISO 14001:2015 ­ Environmental Management System: certifies the concrete commitment to minimising the environmental impact of processes, products and services.

Analysis of the sustainability issues relevant to the Ascopiave Group and its stakeholders
In order to identify the economic, social and environmental topics that are most relevant to the Group and that influence or could significantly influence the assessments, actions and decisions of internal and external stakeholders, the Ascopiave Group performed a new materiality analysis. This analysis was conducted at the end of 2019, on the basis of the new corporate structure, and has highlighted the social, environmental, economic and governance issues of greatest importance for the company and its stakeholders. The analysis was based on the materiality principle as required by the GRI reporting standard and comprised the following steps:
· Identification of the potentially relevant issues for the Ascopiave Group: first, the issues relevant to the Group and its stakeholders were identified through interviews with the Management and the analysis of internal (Code of Ethics, Financial Report, institutional website, etc.) and external (sector studies and publications) documentation, as well as through a structured benchmarking analysis with respect to the industry best practices;
· Evaluation of the relevant issues for the Ascopiave Group: in order to prioritise the relevant issues, the Group has submitted an evaluation questionnaire to a selection of its employees, suppliers and Municipalities shareholders of Asco Holding S.p.A., collecting 40 responses; the results gathered from the survey were cross-checked with the evaluations of the members of the Board of Directors and Heads of function. The issues were evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5.
· Identification of material issues for the Ascopiave Group: by processing the results, on the basis of the materiality threshold chosen (scores above 3.5), it was possible to define the new materiality matrix of the Ascopiave Group, which consists of 17 material issues (divided into 5 macro areas: economic responsibility, social responsibility, responsibility towards employees, responsibility of service towards customers, environmental responsibility);
· Approval of the materiality analysis by the Ascopiave Group Board of Directors on 27th February 2020.

| 70 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The topic relating to the use of water, stated in Italian Legislative Decree 254/16, has not emerged as a material issue from the analysis conducted and therefore will not be further explored within this document.

The ability to maintain profitability in the medium and long term, therefore, guarantees an adequate remuneration of shareholders but also contributes to the generation of value for many stakeholders: the existing employment levels were maintained, customers were granted access to energy services, local initiatives were financed, our suppliers benefited from upstream and downstream activities, the public administration received social security contributions, etc..

Production and distribution of added value
The economic value generated by the Group and consequently distributed to the stakeholders is represented by the scheme of generated and distributed value. This figure is determined by the value generated in the reference period, net of amortisation, depreciation and write-downs, and the value redistributed, in various forms, to the Group's stakeholders. A portion of the economic value is retained by the Group in the form of amortisation, depreciation and reserves. This value was inferred from the items of the income statement used in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31st December 2019. The economic value generated by the Ascopiave Group in 2019 amounted to Euro 615.9 million and was redistributed to the stakeholders as shown in the tables below:

Relations with the Regulatory Authority
The Ascopiave Group conducts its main activity in sectors subject to regulation. The directives and regulatory provisions issued on the matter by the European Union and the Italian Government, the ARERA Decisions and more generally the modification of the reference regulatory framework can have a significant impact on the operations, economic results and financial balance of the Group.

Specifically, the natural gas distribution sector is governed by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) which, through specific measures, determines and updates the tariffs applied to users, defines the minimum levels of quality and safety of the services provided and establishes the methods for non-discriminatory access and use of the infrastructures. The Authority also performs consultative functions vis-à-vis the Parliament and the Government, to which it can submit alerts and proposals. The regulation relating to the procedures for launching the Minimum Territorial Area tenders for awarding the service in concession, including the criteria for the evaluation of the bids, is primarily under the scope of the Ministries, with an important role exercised by the Ministry for Economic Development.
Ascopiave maintains a constructive dialogue with ARERA and the Ministry for Economic Development in order to contribute to the definition of a clear, transparent and stable regulatory framework, which safeguards the sustainable development of the gas system and ensures satisfactory conditions of profitability and financial balance for operators.
To this end, Ascopiave constantly monitors the regulatory evolution of the sector, assesses in advance its economic, financial, operational, organisational and strategic impacts, taking the necessary initiatives vis-à-vis the competent institutional subjects to promote its point of view and contribute to guiding the regulation towards sustainable choices compatible with the corporate objectives. If it deems that the choices made are prejudicial to its legitimate interests, the Group considers the activation of the appropriate means of judicial protection.
With regard to the provisions issued by ARERA, Ascopiave participates both independently and through its professional association in the consultation procedures, formulating its own proposals and observations.

Position of the Ascopiave Group in the gas supply chain
Upon performing its activities, the Ascopiave Group relies on numerous suppliers and/or contractors, and establishes collaborations on the basis of principles of fairness, equity, transparency and mutual cooperation. In addition to the suppliers of energy raw materials, the two main categories with which the Group maintains relationships are the suppliers of goods and services and contractors. The primary aim of the Ascopiave Group is to achieve maximum efficiency, streamlining and speed in the contractual procedure, while ensuring at the same time high quality standards in the provision of the service. In order to achieve these objectives, the Group has set up a supplier approval process, through registration in the company's register, and a selection process based on objective criteria for entrusting the supply assignment.

Supplier approval

Before establishing a contractual relationship with the Ascopiave Group, the supplier must qualify as a "supplier and/or

contractor" by registering in the supplier register.

In order to be able to apply and become a partner of the Ascopiave Group, the supplier must fulfil and maintain the

requirements established by the Procurement Code and other criteria set by the company, in line with Ascopiave's values:

-

Respect for human rights, workers and the environment;

| 74 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

-

Scrupulous observance of labour law, specifically as concerns the obligations regarding child labour and female

employment, sanitary conditions and health and safety, trade union rights and employment of foreign workers, and the fight

against and emergence of undeclared employment;

-

The correct and timely fulfilment of remuneration, contributory, insurance and tax obligations;

-

Compliance with the principles of legality, transparency and fairness in business;

-

The highest degree of professionalism and diligence, as well as utmost honesty and good faith in relations with the

Ascopiave Group.

Each supplier and contractor must ensure that the aforementioned requirements are maintained until the termination of the

contract, observe the Code of Ethics of the Ascopiave Group, the prescriptions and procedures set out in the Organisation,

Management and Control Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, regularly fulfil all obligations concerning safety in

the workplace and not engage in behaviours or practices that are anti-competitive or incompatible with laws, regulations and

third-party rights.

Finally, the supplier approval system adopted is also based on the standards UNI EN ISO 9001 (quality certification), UNI EN ISO

14001 (environmental certification) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety), which provide the Ascopiave Group with

a structured and complete system of procedures that the contractors must also respect.

Supplier selection
Suppliers and contractors are selected in compliance with the principles of competition and equality, on the one hand, and on the basis of objective assessments regarding competitiveness, quality, usefulness and price, on the other hand. The Ascopiave Group does not maintain relationships with companies in relation to which situations of dubious legitimacy or conflict of interests arise and, where economically compatible, favours the use of local contractors, strengthening its bond with the territory and encouraging the economic development of the latter, as the Group believes that it is easier to interact with local businesses, which feel involved in the development of the offer of public services to the citizens.

With regard to the execution of works and in order to guarantee an adequate level of specialisation in the approval process, the types of assignments are grouped into Product Categories divided into critical levels. Each level corresponds to different criteria for evaluating candidates.

Any further checks can be conducted to investigate aspects of professionalism, reliability, solvency, etc. of the supplier being examined, for the purpose of ascertaining that the declarations given by the latter are true.

The Ascopiave Group pays attention to the certifications held by its suppliers in the environmental, quality and health and safety areas, which are those most in line with the Company's sustainability choices.
As concerns contractors in particular, also in 2019 all new suppliers were included in an assessment process according to the social and environmental criteria described above. As early as the selection stage, the supplier must certify the existence of any management systems adopted or commit to observing the principles thereof in the absence of specific certifications. In addition, for large-scale works (generally above Euro 500 thousand), the Group ascertains the correctness and authenticity of the suppliers' requirements and qualifications, especially with regard to compliance with laws and regulations, by applying directly to the relevant Authorities and/or bodies.
The systematic use of electronic procedures is aimed at better responding to market needs, at the same time increasing the degree of collaboration between the Group and its partners.

| 75 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

E-procurement Portal During 2019, 114 invitations to tender were published on the e-procurement portal for the purchase of goods, services and works for a total amount of approximately Euro 34.7 million, in addition to numerous requests for quotations, relating to purchases of a less significant amount, which occur with "traditional" procedures.
The online supplier register has 1,292 registered and approved subjects to date.
The solutions of the On-line supplier register help the Ascopiave Group to identify - in a very extensive market - the best supply alternatives for its needs under sustainable conditions (in terms of time dedicated to research and assessment, risk management, cost etc.). The information can be collected, approved and evaluated on the basis of objective benchmarks and systematically updated almost automatically so as to guarantee the exchange of information both with the supply markets and with the various contact persons involved. The e-procurement system improves the company's performance also in terms of inventory management costs.
Value distributed to suppliers
In terms of purchase volume, in 2019 the Ascopiave group collaborated with 805 suppliers, for a total of 4,262 purchase orders and about Euro 46 million invoiced, excluding purchases of gas and electricity.

Number of suppliers and purchase orders Number of suppliers Number of purchase orders

2018 1,676 5,605

2018 RESTATED 921 3,935

2019 805 4,262

If we analyse the wealth distributed to suppliers in order to assess the impact on the local economy, we find that about half of the value invoiced in 2019 refers to local suppliers (i.e. based in North-Eastern Italy). Although Ascopiave does not intend to favour specific categories of suppliers (in terms of their geographical origin), the impact of the Group on the area where its presence is strongest is nevertheless apparent. In 2019, the Ascopiave Group in fact collaborated with 407 local suppliers, which account for 50.6% of the total, for a total invoiced value of approximately Euro 22 million.

SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

Respect for and development of people Ascopiave, aware that the main keys to success for every enterprise are its human resources, ensures that human rights are respected, promotes the involvement of staff in the achievement of the company's strategic objectives and recognises the professional contribution of people in a context of loyalty, mutual trust and collaboration, making the most of professional skills through training and development activities.

The activities of the Ascopiave Group are managed in full compliance with the regulations in force on labour, social security contributions, salary, taxes and insurance obligations, and on the prevention of and protection from accidents and occupational safety.
The Group undertakes to disseminate and consolidate the culture of safety at work and to raise awareness of risks by using the resources required to guarantee the health and safety of the recipients, the customers and the communities in which it operates.
The employees, at every level, of Ascopiave and the Group companies are expected to collaborate in order to maintain within the company a climate of mutual respect for the dignity, honour and reputation of everyone.

Particular attention is paid to constant training and refresher courses for employees and figures specifically dedicated to safety management (persons appointed and supervisors). In 2019, the total training hours (calculated as the sum of all the hours used by all workers) were around 7,800, with an average of 20.6 hours per worker. The courses covered various aspects of health prevention and protection.

Finally, in order to better manage and plan the training activities, the Group has implemented a new training planning and reporting system, which will become fully operational in 2020.

Incentive and remuneration policies The Ascopiave Group promotes the management and motivation of people through incentive and development policies and instruments. To this end, every year the Group defines and plans schemes complementing those deriving from organisational changes and/or contractual automatisms; such schemes are not envisaged in the contract but enhance individual professional skills. Ascopiave has developed a streamlined and efficient assessment system through which most of the employees periodically receive an evaluation. In this regard, in 2018 a long-term incentive plan was approved, based on performance indicators and the trend of the Group's shares, in favour of executive directors and managerial staff with strategically relevant functions. The adoption of the Plan, called the "2018-2020 long-term incentive plan", was aimed at encouraging and retaining the Ascopiave Group's directors and employees who hold the positions of greater responsibility.
Furthermore, the Ascopiave Group has implemented an incentive system based on objectives (so-called MBO), which envisages a remuneration mechanism according to which the allocation of a variable bonus is dependent on the achievement of corporate and individual objectives. The system aims to consolidate the commitment of the entire organisation to the strategic lines and promote personal development, increasing the accountability and growth of all staff, according to objective and fair criteria.
Equal opportunities and corporate welfare
EXCERPT FROM THE CODE OF ETHICS "All forms of discrimination must be avoided and in particular any discrimination based on race, nationality, gender, age, physical disability, sexual orientation, political or trade union opinions, philosophical views or religious beliefs. Ascopiave and the Group companies undertake to avoid and prosecute any type of harassment in the workplace, interpreting their entrepreneurial role both as the protection of working conditions and the protection of the psycho-physical integrity of the worker, respecting his/her moral personality, avoiding that the latter suffers illicit conditioning or unjustified nuisance."

| 81 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The Ascopiave Group does not discriminate in any way its employees and is sensitive to the issues of equal opportunities both as concerns personnel selection and management, and the organisation of work. The Code of Ethics of the Ascopiave Group, in fact, expressly states the Companies' commitment to non-discrimination and equal opportunities; any violation of these rights is recognised as a breach of the Code of Ethics. Ascopiave pays particular attention to the work-life balance of its workers: specifically, by virtue of a contract which provides for exceptions to the national collective bargaining agreement, the company ensures flexibility for the beginning and end of the working day and allows working mothers with children aged up to 11 to get a part-time job and/or benefit from a more convenient working time.
Employees can also apply for part-time contracts and, at 31st December 2019, 48 contracts had been activated (approximately 10% of total), requested in 87.5% by women workers. The Group also offers the opportunity to benefit from the company canteen service even in the case of part-time working hours.

Benefits granted to employees The Ascopiave Group has defined, with the trade unions of the individual companies, 2nd level agreements according to which employees are granted a performance bonus, commensurate with the achievement of a system of indicators of profitability, efficiency, productivity and quality. The agreements envisage the possibility for the beneficiary of receiving the bonus in the form of Corporate Welfare services, benefitting from additional tax and social security advantages. Furthermore, in order to manage the delivery of the services more effectively, the Group has implemented an internal platform for taking advantage of the services. The platform offers a wide range of benefits, ranging from education and training, to social security and health services, to the purchase of other goods and services from suppliers accredited on the platform. Many employees used the
| 82 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

services in 2019: approximately 19% of staff converted a portion of their 2018 performance bonus into their Welfare account.
As additional corporate welfare measures, the Group offers its employees the possibility of benefitting from: · Contractual Complementary Pension Schemes (Pegaso, Solidarietà Veneto, Previndai Negri); · Complementary Healthcare Insurance, with the Group's contribution for the gas-water contract staff; · Welfare plan for all companies according to which employees can use their 2019, performance bonus, increased by 15%, for welfare services (complementary pension scheme, healthcare services, cultural services, baby-sitting, etc.).
Occupational health and safety
Ascopiave and the Group companies believe that the protection of workers' health and safety is a priority: therefore, the objective is not only to comply with the requirements of the specific applicable regulations, but also to implement actions aimed at the continuous improvement of the working conditions. Safety is promoted within all company activities.
For the Group, the prevention of accidents and occupational diseases is an essential objective of its business activity.
The key elements of the health and safety policy are:
· Measures aimed at increasing the economic value of the company, in full compliance with safety; · Implementation of activities in full compliance with rules and regulations on the health and safety of workers; · Continuous training of personnel, in order to raise awareness of the importance of working according to the laws and
regulations in force, as well as of the consequences that may affect their own safety; · Definition and review of quality, safety and environment targets, in order to maintain an adequate control system and
provide resources for their achievement.
BS OHSAS 18001 certification: "Occupational Safety Management System" The Ascopiave Group has defined guidelines common to all the Group companies in order to promote a Safety Management System complying with the requirements of the OHSAS 18001 standard, increasingly effective and efficient, able to guarantee not only the observance of the mandatory rules but also a continuous improvement, in line with the objectives of the corporate safety policy. The BS OHSAS 18001 certification was obtained in 2011 and reconfirmed again in 2019. The system is fully integrated with those for Quality and the Environment, thus guaranteeing a shared working culture, based on professionalism and efficiency. Thanks to the certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System, Ascopiave is able to monitor the risks related to work, improve performance, make the work environment safer, respect and apply correctly the relevant laws and ensure compliance in the event of inspection. The Ascopiave Group pays particular attention to the analysis of accidents, which allows a detailed report of every type of activity that caused the event. In 2019, there were 9 workplace accidents in total involving operational staff. There was 1 commuting injury. The main accident indexes are described below:
· Frequency index: it reveals the frequency of accidents, i.e. the number of accidents per million hours worked (the greater the index, the greater the frequency of accidents occurred per hours worked);
· Severity index: it shows the number of days lost per thousand hours worked, i.e. the severity of the accidents occurred (the greater the index, the greater the severity of the injuries);
· Occupational disease rate: is the ratio of the number of cases of occupational disease to the total hours worked in the same period, multiplied by 200,000;
· Absenteeism rate: is the ratio of the total days of absence to the total number of workable days in the same period, expressed as a percentage.
The continuous commitment of the Ascopiave Group, combined with the search for continuous improvement, is reflected this year by the data that we derive from the indexes below: accidents remain basically constant, with a decrease in lost days, despite the extension of the scope due to the merger of the company Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A..

Particular attention is devoted to the constant training and refresher courses for employees and for positions specifically dedicated to safety management (managers and persons appointed). In 2019, the total training hours (calculated as the sum of all hours attended by all workers) were 7,078, with an average of about 18.72 hours per employee. The lessons covered various aspects of prevention and protection and health and safety in the workplace.
On-site safety for third-party companies In order to also improve the safety conditions of the personnel of the supplier companies working in our offices and plants, the Ascopiave Group has established specific procedures that govern their access and operation. Third-party companies must inform the Ascopiave Group of any accidents in which their staff is involved during their work at the company's sites.
Since 2016, the Contract Conditions require the parties to "open" contracts for connections, maintenance and network expansions to provide the statistics relating to the accidents occurred during the year on the sites under the responsibility of the Ascopiave Group.
In 2019, there were 6 accidents on site, a figure emerging from the 13 companies involved in the works. Furthermore, the Ascopiave Group also involves the suppliers who work at its sites in safety training: courses, updates and meetings are addressed to the employers/managers when the work starts and whenever the specific nature of the work requires it.

CUSTOMERS AND CITIZENS SERVED

Customers and markets served

The Group's customers are predominantly families, followed by entities and condominiums, businesses and professionals, shops,

artisans and large companies. Thanks to its broad customer base and the quantity of gas sold, the Group is currently one of the

main operators in the industry at a national level.

The Ascopiave Group continues working towards the achievement and maintenance of high quality standards of the service

offered to end customers, sales companies and licensor Municipalities; these operations and services feature complex plant

design, construction and management stages, which require high professionalism and careful monitoring of the conditions of

service, as well as periodic maintenance to guarantee safety and efficiency over time in compliance with the applicable

regulations.

The Ascopiave Group's primary objectives are:

·

To maintain the highest level of quality of the gas and energy supply service, in compliance with the requirements set

by AEEGSI;

·

To ensure an efficient and safe gas distribution network without service downtime.

These commitments are based on the desire to lead the company towards an excellent service in order to become a high quality and dynamic partner able to meet the specific needs of the various customer segments. For this reason, the company's activity is constantly aimed at improving its business with investments based on innovative and pioneering services for the benefit of the community. As a consequence, one of the Group's priorities is to ensure honest and clear trade communications, based on the correctness of the commercial conduct of its own staff and external business partners and on the preparation of transparent and competitive offers in the free market, combined with campaigns dedicated to families. he Group owns concessions and direct assignments for the management of distribution activities in 268 Municipalities, supplying the service to a market segment of 775,000 inhabitants, through a distribution network which spreads over 12,000 kilometres. The sale of natural gas is performed through different companies, some under joint control. Overall, in 2019 the companies of the Group sold over 1 billion cubic metres of gas to end users. The Ascopiave Group maintains relationships with the customer through different channels, working on the quality of the service, safety, appropriate commercial offers with particular attention to the needs of families and on the help to the local community. Thanks to shared values which are determining for its growth, the Ascopiave Group is close to the territory, to the municipal administrations and to local associations, contributing to their sustainable social and environmental development. With this set of intentions, the company wants to contribute to the growth of the surrounding area while respecting sustainability and implementing environmentally friendly solutions in order to make the community aware of energy saving, safety and respect for the environment. With a penchant for volunteering, the Group also supports socially valuable initiatives, bringing tangible aid to citizens and trying to assist the most disadvantaged categories through concrete tools for granting subsidies. The Ascopiave Group is a major industrial company, attentive to people, social issues and local needs. The development of technological innovation projects has also led the Company to evolve towards efficiency and saving, confirming an excellent service quality that exceeds the standards established by the Authority for Electricity, Gas and the Water System (AEEGSI). In 2019, the Ascopiave Group served over 700 thousand users of gas and electricity services. 85% of customers use gas services, while 15% electricity services.

Quality, safety and continuity of service

Service quality indicators represent, in qualitative and quantitative terms, the performance levels of the service provided. They concern:
· Commercial quality (mainly relating to the ability to perform rapidly activities such as the preparation of quotations and the execution of works at the end customers' premises, the activation and deactivation of the supply, timeliness in personalised appointments);

| 85 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

· Technical quality (emergency response times, number of checks performed for odorization and percentage of network inspected).
Below are the results considered satisfactory by the Ascopiave Group in 2019 for each of the quality indicators established:

Service Quality Indicators Compliance with the maximum time set for rendering services under specific commercial quality standards Punctuality in appointments agreed with the end customer

2018 99.55% 99.99%

2019 98.34% 99.96%

Facility inspection plan The Group's attention to plant safety and service continuity is demonstrated by the increasingly concrete commitment to prevention, through inspections on the distribution network as summarised in the following table:

During 2019 there were no accidents related to the company facilities involving the population and the community.

Intervention plan Since 1969, when the Ascopiave Group began equipping the territory with methane facilities and networks, a highly qualified team of engineers and technicians has been applying the most forward-looking technologies in order to guarantee high quality standards in the construction of distribution networks and systems. The design phase is characterised by the use of technologically advanced IT tools and state-of-the-art equipment for the simulation of fluid dynamics configurations in the entire network. This allows us to:
· Ensure the optimal use of the networks, through the correct configuration of the pressures and design the components of the entire network, so as to guarantee continuity of supply even in any "out of order" situations of some plants;
· Forecast the need to adjust the pipeline supply capacity; · Plan effective network replacements so as to adapt them to the local emerging urban/industrial development
needs. Upon building the facilities, the Ascopiave Group has always adopted the most advanced construction solutions, technologies and equipment, and entrusted the construction to contractors with proven experience in the sector and proportionate skills. Supply continuity, by-pass works and no-dig techniques are just some of the measures taken to ensure an efficient and effective service and a safe management of the construction sites.

Emergency service The Group offers an Emergency Service to solve problems related to the supply of gas on the networks managed, such as leaks or seepage, interruptions or irregularities in supply, and damage to the distribution facilities. The service is completely free both from the landline and mobile phones and is available 24 hours a day, every day of the year. All the calls received are recorded and their outcome is monitored.

Emergency management plan The Ascopiave Group has adopted a "Plan for handling gas emergencies and accidents" which defines the responsibilities, objectives, activities, organisational structure and methods for collecting, recording and transmitting the information needed to ensure a rapid and effective management of emergency situations or accidents involving the gas distribution service. An emergency is defined as any event that involves the gas distributed through a network, which may result in serious and/or extensive effects on safety and the continuity of the distribution service. The definition also applies to any event that causes the interruption of the gas supply to at least 250 end Customers without notice when the supply is not reactivated within 24 hours from the start of the interruption. In 2019 there were no gas incidents or emergencies.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
Fundamental values and Environmental policy
The set of values, the corporate ethical principles and the behavioural rules set out in the Code of Ethics inspire every day the activity of all of those who work, as employees or independent contractors, within the Group's sphere of action. The Environmental Policy was adopted by the Parent Company and by the two leading distribution companies. Integrated into Quality and Safety, it expresses the principles and values in the environmental area adopted by the Parent Company Ascopiave and consisting in:
 Sensitivity to ecological issues that limit the impact on the environment of activities and services;  Research and development of technologies aimed at safeguarding resources and reducing the environmental impact
and related risks.  Deep respect for the environment in providing the service, by optimising the management of special waste and the
consumption of the resources used (water, fuels and energy);  Constant compliance with legal standards and requirements for the protection of the environment and risk prevention
for the safeguard of the environment in direct processes (employees) and in indirect ones, entrusted to suppliers and contractors;  Continuous training of personnel, so that they are aware of the importance of working according to the laws and regulations in force, as well as of the consequences that may affect both their own safety and the surrounding environment;  Definition and review of specific environmental objectives, maintaining an adequate control system and providing the resources needed to achieve them.
Environmental protection and rational use of energy
In accordance with a development model compatible with the territory and the environment, Ascopiave undertakes to manage its processes according to principles of environmental protection and efficiency, through the identification, management and control of its environmental aspects, as well as through the rational use of energy resources. Ascopiave is a large enterprise operating on the national scale whose daily objective is to distribute energy, in addition to providing services to the community minimising the environmental impact of its activities also thanks to serious and careful research, technological developments and investments.
UNI EN ISO 14001 Certification "Environmental Management Systems"
Distribution SBU Certification Our sensitivity to ecological issues, combined with the indirect economic benefits resulting from choices that limit the impact on the environment of the activities and services rendered, were decisive factors for the decision to adopt an Environmental Management System, primarily for the activity of methane gas distribution. The decade-long and considerable experience with the Quality Management System has motivated the Ascopiave Group in the pursuit of the Environmental Management System certification and the Occupational Health and Safety certification: the joint certification of Ascopiave for the activity of methane gas distribution was obtained in October 2011. The Integrated Certification was then transferred to the subsidiary AP Reti Gas S.p.A. on 1st July 2016 subsequent to the transfer of the business unit. On 3rd April 2017, Ascopiave acquired 100% of the share capital of Pasubio Group S.p.A. which subsequently changed its name to "AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A.", acquiring the pre-existing integrated Quality, Safety and Environment certifications, duly transferred.
| 90 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The UNI EN ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, integrated with the Quality and Occupational Health and Safety systems, certifies that the organisation is committed daily to such issues: this choice guarantees constant commitment to the improvement of environmental performance and the constant review of the main documents for the analysis and assessment of environmental risks by the Parent Company and the two certified companies dealing with methane gas distribution: AP Reti Gas S.p.A. and AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A..
These operating practices and procedures are also strictly applied by the other two Distribution Companies of the Grou: AP Reti Gas Rovigo S.r.l. and Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A..

Ascopiave Parent company certification On 12th March 2018, the Parent Company Ascopiave obtained the Certifications attesting that its Management Systems are compliant with the reference standards UNI EN ISO 9001, BS OHSAS 18001, UNI EN ISO 14001, in relation to the following scope: "Provision of services for the Group companies Ascopiave".
For ISO 14001, Ascopiave has adopted a simplified Environmental Analysis, because of its scope, limited to administrative services, and the reduced environmental impacts pertaining to civil buildings (soil, water, emissions, special waste, energy and fuel consumption).

Company's fleet
The Ascopiave Group has 262 corporate vehicles powered by diesel fuel and gasoline. Considering that Ascopiave operates locally, the impact on vehicular traffic linked to its fleet can be considered negligible: nevertheless, the Group constantly monitors fuel consumption. Overall, consumption was around 375 thousand litres, recording a proportional increase in consumption, due to the acquisition of AP Rete Gas Vicenza's fleet, in addition to the full merger of Unigas into Edigas.

In line with its commitment to reducing environmental impacts, in June 2011 the Group put into service a photovoltaic station, integrated into the roof of the building used as a warehouse/archive for the exclusive use of the registered office. In 2019, the amount of self-produced electricity was equal to 214 thousand kWh, a slight decrease as compared to 2018, essentially due to less radiation and some accidental breakdowns that occurred to the plant; this resulted in a decrease of 1% in self-consumed energy compared to 2018. Despite this, however, the consumption of gas and electricity decreased thanks to prudent actions to rationalise consumption.

The efficiency of the cogenerators combined with district heating has made it possible to save 37 TEP TOEs (tons of oil equivalent).

Energy efficiency initiatives

Enhancement of the efficiency of the Ascopiave Group headquarters in Pieve di Soligo

With the aim of making the Group's headquarters more energy efficient, in 2019 the process for improving the efficiency of the lighting system of the Ascopiave Group's registered office continued. Specifically, entire sections of the external lighting system switched to LED technology, both as regards wall and pole lamps, as indicated in the diagram below:

The Ascopiave Group has pursued the objectives set for energy savings through interventions on customers, initiatives within the company and the plants and through the purchase of Energy Efficiency Certificates (TEE), while continuing to promote efficiency.
2019 benefitted from some existing energy efficiency projects: · Efficiency improvement project relating to the renovation of the external envelope of two nursing homes, one in Treviso and one in Pieve di Soligo. · Efficiency improvement project relating to the public lighting system in the Municipality of Vidor (TV) · Efficiency improvement project relating to the public lighting system in the Municipality of Coseano (UD)

During 2019, Ascopiave developed its Research and Development sector, creating a new company called Asco Energy S.p.A., born from the reorganisation of the company Veritas Energia S.p.A.. The new structure has acquired, together with the Research and Development Division, the ESCO UNI 11339 Certification, a new ISO 9001-2015 accreditation, for the activities of efficiency improvement, management and construction of thermal and electric plants, district heating. The new enterprise, under the guidance of the parent company's Research and Development Division, was entrusted with the task of developing energy efficiency projects, performing energy efficiency certificates transactions on behalf of all the companies of the Group which have to comply with such obligation, and identifying new business opportunities in the energy field. In 2019, Asco Energy performed TEE transactions in favour of the group's companies to which the obligation applies, for a quantity equal to 79,675 TEEs.
The organisation was equipped, in affiliation with the Parent company's Research and Development Division, with high-level technical staff, in particular figures specialising in the field of Energy Efficiency and Project Management, and EPC. The structure thus has several graduates in industrial engineering and economics, who are EGE certified according to the UNI CEI 11352 standard for the Industrial and civil sector, EMAS certified as "NACE code 84.11 Environmental Reviewer Consultant", Lead Auditor of Management Systems for the Environment UNI EN ISO 14001. The employees are guided by executives, graduates with proven experience, specialised in managerial engineering.
The Research and Development Division renewed, on behalf of Asco Energy, the UNI CEI 11352 certification for ESCO companies.
In 2019, the new company participated, in aggregated mode, in a call for tenders issued by the Municipality of Treviso, for the improvement of the entire public lighting network in the municipal area. The extent of the project can be inferred from the 11,810 light fixtures to be replaced in order to save, as forecast in the public tender, 3,969,000 kWh per year.
In 2018, the project concerning the local production and injection into the network of biomethane extracted from the biodegradable fraction of urban solid waste was revised and approved. The revised and re-proposed project envisages the optimisation of the local municipal waste collection chain, through the recovery and production of biofuel in compliance with the provisions of Italian Ministerial Decree dated 5th December 2013. The original project envisaged the treatment, at the collection site, of 43,000 tons of biodegradable waste, assuming an annual production of 2,000,000 Scm of biomethane. The revised project involves the production of 4,000,000 Scm of biomethane, about half of which to be injected directly into the urban distribution networks, while the remaining 2,000,000 Scm would be allocated to the production of bio-LNG (Liquid Natural Gas), to be sold to the local goods transport sector, minimising the negative externalities (CO2) produced locally.
In mid-2019, the biomethane production project was presented, as a project financing proposal, to the local public company responsible for managing the collection and disposal cycle of solid urban waste.

Cogeneration / District Heating
The Group has managed cogeneration plants and the respective district heating networks serving around 700 civil, commercial and public customers and some thermal plants serving condominiums.

| 95 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

These plants contribute to the improvement of air quality in the urban centres in which they are located because, thanks to their construction, the installation of individual thermal facilities is avoided (the latter are certainly less efficient both in terms of consumption and CO2 emissions). With district heating, heat production is centralised in more efficient and better controlled stations than domestic boilers. Control is continuous, both as concerns combustion processes and atmospheric emissions.
In 2019, the most significant plants managed by the Group, in terms of environmental friendliness, were four:
· The "Le Cime" plant in Mirano (Venice): this is a trigeneration plant, operating in winter for the supply of thermal energy for heating the connected customers and in summer to supply the absorber for the production of refrigeration energy for cooling the same customers. The plant benefited from the incentive deriving from the Green Certificates which in 2014, the last year of the incentives, produced 294 green certificates. At the end of 2016, another 51 customers of a new real estate complex built near the station were connected, allowing in 2017 the improvement of its overall efficiency, avoiding the installation of 51 new single-family boilers and their respective CO2 emissions.
· The "Bella Mirano" plant in Mirano (Venice): it provides thermal energy in district heating and electricity to the grid. The plant in 2015 recorded an increase from 89% to 100% in the saturation of connected residential customers. During 2017, the saturation level remained unchanged. Thanks to the efficient management of the plant, in accordance with Italian Ministerial Decree dated 5th September 2011, the company obtained, as in 2019, 18 TEEs (energy efficiency certificates) equal to 18 TOEs saved (tons of oil equivalent);

· The "Cà Tron" plant in Dolo (Venice): in the cogeneration station combined with the district heating grid, compared to last year, the degree of saturation of users remained unchanged. In 2017, thanks to the efficient management of the plant, in accordance with Italian Ministerial Decree dated 5th September 2011, 19 TEEs (energy efficiency certificates)
were achieved, equal to 26 TOEs saved (tons of oil equivalent), increasing by 90%;

· The "S. Silvestro" plant in Vetrego di Mirano (Venice): in operation since 2014, it is our first thermal system, completely powered by renewable sources. In 2019, the plant produced about 101 MWh of thermal energy, allowing a saving of about 10 TOEs (tons of oil equivalent), thanks to the use of "renewable" fuel; the balance of CO2 emissions is zero.

Waste management
Production and storage of Special Waste
The Ascopiave Group uses a specific IT programme to support and standardise the management of Special Waste for all Group companies that handle Special Waste. The Parent Company and all the distribution companies are involved in this practice, while Asco Energy is the only exception: its special waste is produced and disposed of by the external suppliers entrusted with ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. This type of management has succeeded in standardising both document registration and filing practices and the annual MUD (unified form of environmental declarations)3. The waste generated during the various production stages is collected in special containers, chosen according to their type (barrels, garbage bins, bags, boxes, etc.), adequately identified and stored in areas specifically defined in order to avoid dispersion into the environment (Temporary Storage). Where applicable, the Group has extended the registration in the SISTRI (waste traceability control system) to all the Sites that produce hazardous waste, namely all the sites that manage the production and disposal of Special Waste (even in small quantities).
ECOBOX for the disposal of used toner cartridges Used toner cartridges are disposed of through ECOBOX. The consolidated practice, used for over two years now, is supported by a specific Operating Instruction, included in the Ascopiave Integrated Management System and adopted by all Group companies that use rented printers contracted by the Parent Company.
3 Defined as the unified form of environmental declarations; the declaration is the annual report of the loading and unloading registers of special waste.
| 97 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Two different periodic delivery methods have been defined, which have in common the supply of the ECOBOX and the deadline, at least annual:  Agreements with the inter-municipal Centres for Differentiated Waste Collection (CERD):
for the ecological disposal of used toner cartridges of the company's photocopiers;  Agreements with private companies in the absence of a public collection service:
in the absence of such agreements the Ascopiave Group has defined a procedure according to which waste is collected by a private company authorised to transport waste, with the formalisation of a specific "private agreement"; unlike the procedure with local cooperatives, the collection involves the preparation of the form (FIR). Thanks to ECOBOX, the Administrative Offices and the local offices do not have to manage the two EWC codes (080318 160216) as "Special waste", and the Loading and unloading register does not apply to the Group's companies. In 2019, only the former company UNIGAS registered this EWC code in the loading and unloading register of the Nembro registered office (the company was an "investee" of the Group).

Recovery and disposal of Special Waste
The waste is collected and sent to recovery or disposal operations within the expiration date of the Temporary Storage chosen by the waste producer (quarterly or annual frequency). Currently, for the Ascopiave Group, only the Warehouse of AP Reti Gas Headquarters needs to respect a quarterly expiration for its Temporary Storage. The other Storages, among which Ascopiave's registered office, maintain an annual frequency. The Group Companies, namely Ascopiave and the distribution companies, deliver the special waste to the authorised disposal or recovery facility via accredited transporters: once the suppliers have been approved subsequent to the verification of the required qualifications, the periodic renewal of the Authorisations is monitored and updated by using software dedicated to special waste management. Both AP Reti Gas and AP Reti Gas Vicenza are authorised by the Register of Environmental Managers to transport their own nonhazardous special waste to the Authorised Recovered Facility. In 2019, AP Reti Gas delivered directly to the Authorised Recovered Facility (6 journeys) 1,300 kg of paper and cardboard packages in total (EWC 150101) produced at the Sandrigo site (the Group's total annual production was 15,330 kg, or 9.5%). The transportation of the remaining quantities of special waste produced by the Group to the authorised Destination Facilities, exclusively in the Italian territory, took place through accredited companies (National Register of Environmental Managers for transportation). Asco Energy did not produce special waste in the 2017-2019 three-year period, as the waste produced in the maintenance activities of the plants operated is disposed of by outsourced Contractors, as highlighted in the specific Maintenance contracts. In the three-year period 2017-2019, no complaints/reports were received about this environmental aspect from the parties involved, and no critical issues regarding the disposal of waste were recorded.

 in the two-year period 2018/2019, AP Reti Gas Vicenza delivered 100% of the EWC 150106 production (mixed packaging) to the Schio waste-to-energy plant: in 2019, the incidence was 14.3% of the Group total; normally this type of waste is always "recovered", both in the Ascopiave Group and in the national territory.
 some warehouses in the Lombardy/Piedmont Area of the companies AP Reti Gas and Edigas, in 2019 delivered the hazardous waste EWC 150111* for disposal (D15), for a percentage of 4% of the Group's total production; normally this type of waste is always "recovered", both in the Group and in the national territory.
The main categories of special waste produced by the Group, having a greater impact in terms of quantity, are:

EWC Code 150101 - 200101 150103 - 170201 160213* - 160214 150106 170402 170405

Electric vehicle charging station In 2019, a charging station for the electric vehicles of the company was installed at the headquarters in Pieve di Soligo, with a power of 22 kW. The charging station is located in the parking lot opposite the office open to the public, and is therefore also available to external users.
Reduction of plastic consumption In order to reduce plastic waste deriving from the consumption of bottled water by employees, 12 drinking water dispensers were installed in 2019 at the offices of Pieve di Soligo and Treviso. Furthermore, reusable bottles made of Tritan were distributed to employees, free of charge. Tritan is an ecological material, completely safe for health, which can be reused for a long time.

In accordance with CONSOB resolution no. 15519 dated 27th July 2006, the effects of the transactions with related parties are shown in the specific representation contained in the paragraph "Transactions with related parties" of this annual financial report.

N.B.: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares net of own shares. For the purposes of the calculation of the basic earnings per share, we specify that the numerator is the economic result for the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.

|115 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Company information
Ascopiave S.p.A. (hereinafter "Ascopiave", the "Company" or the "Parent Company" and, jointly with its subsidiaries, the "Group" or the "Ascopiave Group") is a legal entity under Italian law. As of 31st December 2019 the majority share of the Company's share capital, amounting to Euro 234,411,575, was held by Asco Holding S.p.A.; the remainder was distributed among other private shareholders. Ascopiave is listed since December 2006 on the Mercato Telematico Azionario ­ STAR Segment ­ organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.. The registered office of the Company is in Pieve di Soligo (TV), via Verizzo, 1030, Italy. The publication of the Financial report as of 31st December 2019 of the Ascopiave Group was authorised by resolution of the Board of Directors on 13th March 2020.
The activities of the Ascopiave Group Ascopiave mainly operates in the sector of distribution of natural gas, as well as in other sectors related to the core business, such as heat management and co-generation. The Group owns concessions and direct assignments for the management of the activity of gas distribution in 268 municipalities (230 municipalities as of 31st December 2018 (the change is mainly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation), has a distribution network extending for over 12,855 km2 (9,809 km as of 31st December 2018, 2977 km connected to the extension of the scope of consolidation) and provides a service to a catchment area bigger than 1 million inhabitants. The process begun in the last months of 2018, aimed at enhancing the gas sales activities and strengthening and consolidating its presence in the distribution sector, was completed on 19th December 2019. Such process led to the execution between the Ascopiave Group and the Hera Group of a partnership which ratified the establishment, through EstEnergy, of the largest Energy player in Northern-Eastern Italy. As part of the transaction, Ascopiave S.p.A. sold its stakes in the sales companies to EstEnergy, from which it then acquired a 48% stake, while the Hera Group sold the entire stake held in Ap Reti Gas Nord Est S.p.A. to Ascopiave, in addition to a 3% stake in Hera Comm.
General drafting criteria and main accounting standards adopted
The Ascopiave Group Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31st December 2019 were prepared pursuant to IFRS, that is all the "International Financial Reporting Standards", "International Accounting Standards" (IAS), all the interpretations of the "International Financial Reporting Committee" (IFRIC), previously "Standing Interpretations Committee" (SIC) adopted by the European Commission pursuant to the procedure set forth in EC Directive no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council on 19th July 2002. The accounting principles adopted are consistent with those used as of 31st December 2018, except as described in the following paragraph "Accounting principles, amendments and interpretations effective from 1st January 2019". The consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euro, the currency used in the economy where the Group operates, and includes the Consolidated assets and liabilities statement, the Comprehensive consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, the Consolidated statement of cash flows and the Explanatory notes. All the values reported in the statements and explanatory notes are expressed in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise indicated. With regard to the presentation methods of the formats of financial statements, the Consolidated statement of assets and liabilities has been prepared on the basis of the "current/non-current" distinction; for the comprehensive consolidated income statement the multi-step format was adopted with the classification of costs by nature and for the consolidated Cash flow statement the indirect method of representation. The values used for consolidation were gathered from income statements and balance sheets prepared by the Directors of the individual subsidiaries. These data have been adjusted and reclassified, where necessary, to ensure compliance with international accounting standards and with the classification criteria applied throughout the Group.

|116 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

These financial statements as of 31st December 2019 were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on 13th March 2020.
Application of IFRS 5 "Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"
On 19th December 2019, as better explained in the paragraph "Significant events during the financial year", Ascopiave S.p.a. and the Hera Group finalised the operation which led to the establishment of a primary energy business in northern-eastern Italy, which boasts over one million energy customers, as well as the reorganisation of the respective gas distribution activities. The closing, subsequent to the framework agreement dated 30th July and the ensuing approvals by the competent authorities and bodies, involved the exchange between the Hera Group and Ascopiave of assets of equal value, in the energy sales activities, on the one hand, and in gas distribution, on the other. The economic aspects of the transaction did not change compared to the announcements, except for the adjustments at the closing date envisaged by the framework agreement signed in July, as well as the arrangements defined for governance and the options to handle the stakes of Ascopiave in EstEnergy and Hera Comm. The operation represents an important step in the evolution of the business portfolios of the Hera and Ascopiave Groups, fully consistent with the development lines approved by the respective Boards of Directors. The operation, started on 17th June 2019 with the execution of a binding Term Sheet, finalised in a framework agreement on 31st July 2019, envisaged, in the sector of gas and electricity sales, the creation of a single operator for the respective sales activities in the regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Lombardy, through EstEnergy S.p.A., a company which was controlled jointly even before the closing by Ascopiave S.p.A. and Hera Comm S.r.l., the sales company of the Hera Group. EstEnergy S.p.A. will see a substantial expansion of its activities in the aforementioned area, encompassing the sales business of the Ascopiave Group relating to the subsidiaries Ascotrade S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A. and the joint ventures Asm Set S.r.l., Etra Energia S.r.l. and Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation. Furthermore, as part of the overall reorganisation of the gas and electricity customer marketing area, Amgas Blu, a sales company wholly owned by Ascopiave, active in the province of Foggia has been acquired directly by Hera Comm. Consequently, in this Financial report, the assets listed were represented as "Discontinued operations" based on the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 5 "Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations". Estenergy S.p.A. itself, due to the nature of the operation, was represented among the "Discontinued operations". On the basis of these provisions, the economic results achieved by the sales segment during the year are shown separately in a single line of the income statement, while no assets or liabilities are shown. The periods shown for comparative purposes were reclassified in accordance with the principles of the standard. Specifically, the comprehensive income statement as of 31st December 2018 and the cash flow statement as of 31st December 2018 were restated, while the balance sheet and financial position as of 31st December 2018 remained unchanged. The transactions between continuing operations and discontinued operations during the comparative periods were not eliminated. The extent and nature of such transactions would have in fact determined an overly distorted view of the balance sheet and financial position, as well as of the operating results, not representing the performance as if these were standalone assets.
The table below shows the effects deriving from the application of IFRS 5 on the balance sheet and financial position as of 31st December 2018 in order to better describe the changes that have occurred in equity stocks during the period.

Financial statements representation
The items of the consolidated assets and liabilities statement are classified into "current" and "non-current"; those in the comprehensive consolidated income statement are classified by their nature in multi-step format. The statement of changes in shareholders' equity presents the opening and closing balances of each net equity item reconciling them through the profit or loss for the period, any operation with shareholders (if applicable) and other variations in the net equity. The statement of cash flows has been defined according to the "indirect" method, by adjusting operating income of non-monetary components. We believe that these patterns adequately represent the economic situation and financial position.
Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations applied from 1st January 2019
Below is a brief description of amendments, improvements and interpretations applicable to financial reports closed after 31st December 2018 and applicable commencing 1st January 2019. The standards, amendments and interpretations which by their nature cannot be adopted by the Group are excluded from the list.
IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments On 7th June 2017, IASB issued interpretation IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, which provides indications as to how to recognise, as far as income taxes are concerned, uncertainties over the tax treatment of a
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|119 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

given event. IFRIC 23 is applicable from 1st January 2019. Early adoption is allowed, but the Group decided not to exercise this option.
IFRS 9 ­ Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation On 12th October 2017, IASB published some amendments to IFRS 9 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, aimed at allowing the measurement of amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) of financial assets characterised by a prepayment option with the so-called "negative compensation". These changes will be effective from 1st January 2019. Early adoption is permitted (in conjunction with the date of first application of IFRS 9) but the Group decided not to exercise this option.
IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28) The amendment, issued by IASB on 12th October 2017, concerns companies that finance associates and joint ventures with loans for which a short-term repayment is not expected. The amendment is applicable commencing 1st January 2019.
IFRS 16 ­ Leases IFRS 16 standard ­ Leases was approved on 31st October 2017, with significant impact on Statements of lessees: the distinction between financial leases and operating leases was eliminated, introducing a new single model for all leases which entails an asset entry for the right of use and a liability entry for the lease. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2019. The Ascopiave Group has decided not to adopt the standard ahead of time (concomitantly with the date of first application of IFRS 15). On the basis of the transition provisions of IFRS 16, on 1st January 2019 the effects related to the cases existing on the same date have been recognised, without restating the previous comparative period (so-called "modified retrospective approach") and recognising the right-of-use asset for an amount equal to the respective financial liability.
The following table shows the impacts of the first adoption of the standard on the Group's equity data:

(Thousands of Euro)
Non-current assets Intangible assests - of which rights to use real estate - of which rights to use other assets Current and non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities - of which non-current financial liabilities Current liabilities - of which current financial liabilities

The discount rate used for the transition to the new standard is the Group's marginal cost of debt of as of 1st January 2019. The evaluation did not include, as allowed by the standard, short-term leases and low-value asset leases. For the Group, the effect of the application of the new standard has mainly concerned operating leases relating to tangible fixed assets such as buildings, vehicles and trucks, as well as computer equipment. The adoption of IFRS 16 determined, on 1st January 2019, the recognition of greater right-of-use fixed assets for Euro 991 thousand and an equal amount of financial payables for leases divided into current and non-current.

|120 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Annual improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle On 12th December 2017, IASB issued the "Annual improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle" as part of the annual programme for improving the principles; most of the changes are clarifications or corrections to existing IFRSs, or amendments resulting from changes previously made to the IFRSs. These improvements will be effective from 1st January 2019.
IAS 19 ­ Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement On 7th February 2018, IASB published the amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, specifying the methods according to which, in the event of changes to a defined benefit plan, the costs relating to pension benefits must be determined for the remaining relevant period. These changes will be effective from 1st January 2019.
Other accounting standards, amendments and interpretations applied from 1st January 2019
IFRS 2 ­ Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions On 20th June 2016, IASB published a number of amendments to IFRS 2 - Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions. With these changes, the document resolves some issue related to the accounting on share based payments. Specifically, the amendments improve considerably the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, classification thereof and accounting for modification of a share-based payment from cash-settled to equity-settled.
IFRIC 22 ­ Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration On 8th December 2016, IASB published IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration, defining the exchange rate to be used in foreign currencies transactions in case the payment is made or received in advance. The application of such interpretation had no impact on the Group's financial report as the Group does not transact in foreign currency. On the same date, IASB issued the document "Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle" as part of the programme of annual improvements to the standards; most amendments are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRS, or amendments resulting from changes previously made to the IFRSs. The application of these amendments had no impact on the Group's financial reports.
IAS 40 ­ Transfers of Investment Property On 8th December 2016, IASB issued amendments to IAS 40 - Transfers of Investment to govern transfer to/from investment property to other asset groups. Specifically, it is settled if a property under construction or development accounted in inventories may be reclassified in property investments if there was a change in its usage.
IAS/IFRS accounting standards and related IFRIC interpretations approved and applicable to the financial statements of the years starting after 1st January 2019
Please find below a description of the new standards and interpretations already issued and approved by the European Union, applicable to financial statements beginning after 1st January 2019 or adopted earlier.
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting On 29th March 2018, IASB published the revised version of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting together with a document that updates the references to the previous Conceptual Framework contained in the IFRSs, providing:
- an updated definition of assets and liabilities; - a new chapter on the topics of measurement, derecognition and disclosure;
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|121 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

- clarifications on some postulates for compiling the financial statements, such as the principle of prudence and the substance over form concept.
These changes will be effective from 1st January 2020.
IFRS 3 ­ Business Combinations On 22nd October 2018, IASB published the amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, with the aim of identifying the criteria according to which a successful acquisition regards a business or a group of assets that, as such, do not meet the definition of business set out in IFRS 3. These changes will be effective for the business combinations that will occur commencing 1st January 2020.
IAS 1 and IAS 8 On 31st October 2018, IASB published the amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, clarifying the definition of "material information", in order to establish whether to include a disclosure in the financial statements. These changes will be effective from 1st January 2020.
IFRS and IFRIC accounting standards, amendments and interpretations approved by the European Union, not yet mandatorily applicable and not adopted ahead of time as of 31st December 2019
On 31st October 2018, the IASB published the document "Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)". The document introduced a change in the definition of "relevant" contained in IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. This amendment has the aim of making the definition of "relevant" more specific and has introduced the concept of "obscured information" alongside the concepts of omitted or incorrect information already present in the two modified standards. The amendment clarifies that information is "obscured" if it has been described in such a manner as to produce a similar effect for the primary readers of the financial statements to that produced if such information had been omitted or was incorrect. The changes introduced were approved on 29th November 2019 and apply to all transactions subsequent to 1st January 2020.
On 29th March 2018, the IASB published an amendment to the "References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards". The amendment is effective for periods starting on 1st January 2020 or later, but early application is allowed. The Conceptual Framework defines the fundamental concepts for financial reporting and guides the Board in the development of IFRS standards. The document helps ensure that the standards are conceptually consistent and that similar transactions are treated the same way, in order to provide useful information to investors, lenders and other creditors. The Conceptual Framework supports companies in the development of accounting standards when no IFRS standard is applicable to a particular transaction and, more generally, helps the parties involved to understand and interpret the Standards.
The IASB, on 26th September 2019, published an amendment called "Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform", modifying IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as well as IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Specifically, the amendment modifies some of the requirements for the application of hedge accounting, envisaging temporary exceptions, in order to mitigate the impact deriving from the uncertainty of the IBOR reform (still in progress) on future cash flows in the period preceding its completion. The amendment also requires companies to provide additional information in the financial statements regarding their hedging relationships which are directly affected by the uncertainties generated by the reform and to which the aforementioned exceptions apply. The changes take effect from 1st January 2020, but companies can choose early application.

|122 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

IFRS accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet approved by the European Union
At the reporting date, the competent bodies of the European Union have not completed yet the approval process necessary for the adoption of the amendments and principles described below.
On 22nd October 2018, the IASB published the document "Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)". The document provides some clarifications regarding the definition of business for the purposes of the correct application of IFRS 3. Specifically, the amendment clarifies that while a business usually produces an output, the generation of an output is not strictly necessary to identify a business in the presence of an integrated set of activities/processes and assets. However, to meet the definition of business, an integrated set of activities/processes and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. To this end, the IASB has replaced the expression "ability to create outputs" with "ability to contribute to the creation of outputs" to clarify that a business can exist even without the presence of all the inputs and processes necessary to create an output. The amendment also introduces an optional "concentration test" which excludes the presence of a business if the price paid is substantially attributable to a single activity or set of activities. The changes apply to all business combinations and acquisitions of activities subsequent to 1st January 2020, but early application is permitted.
On 18th May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts which is intended to replace IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts. The objective of the new standard is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents the rights and obligations arising from the insurance contracts issued. The IASB has developed the standard to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses of existing accounting policies, providing a single principle-based framework to take into account all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that an insurer holds. The new standard also envisages presentation and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between entities belonging to this sector. The new standard measures an insurance contract based on a General Model or a simplified version thereof, called Premium Allocation Approach ("PAA"). The main features of the General Model are:
- the estimates and assumptions of future cash flows are always the current ones; - the measurement reflects the time value of money; - the estimates envisage extensive use of information observable on the market; - there is a current and explicit risk measurement; - the expected profit is deferred and aggregated into groups of insurance contracts at the time of initial
recognition; and - the expected profit is recognised in the contractual coverage period taking into account the adjustments
deriving from changes in the assumptions relating to the cash flows connected to each group of contracts. The PAA approach involves measuring the liability for the residual coverage of a group of insurance contracts provided that, at the time of initial recognition, the entity envisages that this liability provides a reasonable approximation to the general model. Contracts with coverage period of one year or less are automatically eligible for the PAA approach. The simplifications deriving from the application of the PAA method do not apply to the assessment of liabilities for existing claims, which are measured with the General Model. However, it is not necessary to discount those cash flows if the balance to be paid or collected is expected to take place within one year from the date on which the claim occurred. An entity shall apply the new standard to insurance contracts issued, including reinsurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held and also to investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF). The standard applies from 1st January 2021, but early application is permitted, only for entities that apply IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
On 11th September 2014, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture. The document was published in order to resolve the current conflict between IAS 28 and IFRS 10. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 28, the profit or loss resulting from the sale or transfer of a non-monetary asset to a joint venture or associate in exchange for a share in the capital of the latter is limited to the share held in the joint venture or associate by other investors outside the transaction. On the contrary, IFRS 10 envisages the recognition of the entire profit or loss in the event of loss of control of a subsidiary,
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|123 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

even if the entity continues to hold a non-controlling stake in the same, including in this case also the sale or transfer of a subsidiary company to a joint venture or associate. The changes introduced envisage that in a sale/transfer of an asset or subsidiary to a joint venture or associate, the extent of the profit or loss to be recognised in the financial statements of the seller/transferor depends on whether the sold/transferred assets or subsidiaries constitute a business or not, as defined by IFRS 3. In the event that the assets or the subsidiary sold/transferred represent a business, the entity must recognise the profit or loss on the entire stake previously held whereas, otherwise, the share of profit or loss relating to the share still held by the entity must be eliminated. At the moment the IASB has suspended the application of this amendment.
Name and registered office of the company in charge of drafting the consolidated financial statements
With reference to the information required by Art. 2427, item 22-5 and-6 of the Italian Civil Code, we specify that Company Ascopiave S.p.A. with registered office in Pieve di Soligo (TV), 1030 Via Verizzo drafts the Consolidated Financial Statement of smaller group of which it is part as a subsidiary company. The entirety of this Consolidated Financial Statement is available at its registered office. Furthermore, the Company Asco Holding S.p.A. with registered office in Pieve di Soligo (TV), 1030 Via Verizzo drafts the Consolidated Financial Statement of largest group of which it is part.

Business combinations
Merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A. and simultaneous transfer of the gas distribution business to the fully controlled subsidiary Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. As of 31st December 2018, Ascopiave S.p.A. held 48.86% of the share capital of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., a jointly controlled entity. The remainder, 51.14%, was held by Anita S.r.l.. On 25th June 2019, the deed of merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. was signed, with the simultaneous transfer of the assets and liabilities of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. to Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. thus allowing the acquisition of the management of the entire gas distribution business of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l.. The operation took effect on 1st July 2019, when the treasury shares of Ascopiave S.p.A. were transferred to the former shareholders of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l..
Ascopiave and the Hera Group: primary energy partnership in Northern-Eastern Italy Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Hera Group completed the transaction which led, on 19th December 2019, to the establishment of the largest energy player in Northern-Eastern Italy, boasting over one million customers, and the simultaneous reorganisation of their respective gas distribution activities. The closing, subsequent to the framework agreement dated 30th July and the ensuing approvals by the competent authorities and bodies, involved the exchange between the Hera Group and Ascopiave of assets of equal value, in the energy sales activities, on the one hand, and in gas distribution, on the other.

Consolidation area and principles
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all the subsidiaries. The Group controls an entity (including the structured entities) when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to the variability of results from such entities and has the possibility of influencing these outcomes through the exercise of power over the entity. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated financial statements commencing the date on which control is taken until the date such control ceases. The costs incurred in the acquisition process are expensed in the year they are incurred. The assets and liabilities, the charges and income of companies consolidated with the lineby-line method are fully included in the consolidated financial statements; the book value of investments is eliminated against the corresponding share of equity of the investee companies. Receivables and payables, as well as the costs and revenues arising from transactions between companies included in the consolidation area are entirely eliminated; the capital gains and losses arising from transfers of assets between consolidated companies, the gains and losses deriving from transactions between consolidated companies related to the sale of assets that remain as inventories of the purchasing company, the write-downs and write-backs of investments in consolidated companies, as well as intercompany dividends are also eliminated. At the date of acquisition of control, the net equity of the investee companies is determined by attributing to the individual assets and liabilities their current value. Any positive difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as "Goodwill"; if negative, it is recognised in the income statement. The equity and profit shares attributable to minority interests are recorded in specific items of the shareholders' equity and income statement. In the case of acquisition of partial control, the equity share of minority interests is determined on the basis of the share of the current values assigned to assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition of control, excluding any goodwill attributable to them (so-called partial goodwill method); in relation to this, the minority interests are measured at their total fair value, also including the goodwill (negative goodwill) attributable to them. The choice of the methods for determining the goodwill (negative goodwill) is made based on each individual business combination operation. In the case of shares acquired subsequent to the acquisition of control (purchase of minority interests), any positive difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding portion of equity acquired is recognised in the equity; similarly, the effects arising from the sale of minority interests without loss of control are recognised in equity. If the acquisition value of the shares is higher than the net equity pro-quota value of the investees, the positive difference is attributed, where possible, to the net assets acquired based on their fair value while the remainder is recorded in an item of assets, "Goodwill". The value of goodwill is not amortised but is subject to, at least on an annual basis, an impairment test when facts or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be realised. Goodwill is booked at cost, net of impairment losses. If the carrying value of the investments is lower than the net equity pro-quota value of the investees, the negative difference is recognised in the income statement. The acquisition costs are booked in the income statement. Associated companies are those over which a significant influence is exercised, which is presumed to exist when the shareholding is between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. The carrying value of these investments is in line with the Shareholders' equity and includes the recording of the higher values attributed to assets and liabilities and any goodwill identified upon acquisition. The unrealised gains and losses generated on transactions between the Parent Company/Subsidiaries and the investee valued with the equity method are eliminated based on the value of the stake held by the Group in the investee; the unrealised losses are eliminated, except when they represent an impairment. The financial statements of subsidiaries and jointly controlled Companies used for the purpose of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements are those approved by the respective Boards of Directors. The data of the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis or with the equity method are adjusted, where necessary, to harmonise them with the accounting standards used by the Parent company, which are in accordance with the IFRSs adopted by the European Union.

|126 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Measurement criteria
The accounting principles adopted by the Group are reported below:
Goodwill: the goodwill obtained from the acquisition of business units operating in the distribution and sale of gas is initially booked at cost and represents the excess of the purchase price compared to the portion pertaining to the purchaser for the net fair value referred to values identifying the current and potential assets and liabilities. After the initial booking, goodwill can no longer be amortised and is reduced by any impairment. Goodwill is subjected to an annual recoverability analysis, or a more frequent one if events or changes in circumstances occur which can lead to the emergence of possible impairments. With the intent of analysing the recoverability, the goodwill acquired through groups of companies is allocated, as of the acquisition date, to each of the units (or groups of units) that generate financial flows with the Group that it is held would benefit from the synergy effects of the acquisition, without regard to the allocation of other assets or liabilities of these units (or groups of units). Units generating financial flows: (i) represent the lowest level, within the Group, to which the goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes; (ii) are no greater than one sector, as defined in the primary or secondary indication scheme of the Group pursuant
to IFRS 8 "Product information sector. Impairment is determined by defining the recoverable value of a unit, which generates flows (or groups of units) to which goodwill is allocated. When the recoverable value of a unit which generates flows (or group of units) is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated. In cases in which the goodwill is attributed to a cash generating unit (or group of units) whose assets are partially divested, the goodwill associated with the transferred assets is considered in order to determine the positive or negative change derived from the operation. Goodwill transferred in such cases is calculated based on the values relative to the asset transferred with respect to the assets still held regarding the same unit.
Other intangible fixed assets: intangible assets mainly include assets pertaining to concessions between the public and the private sectors (so-called service concession agreements) related to development, financing, management and maintenance of infrastructures in concession, of which: (i) the lessor controls or regulates the services supplied by operator through the infrastructure and their prices; (ii) the lessor controls through property, ownership of benefits or in other ways any significant remaining profit-
sharing at the end of the concession.
Other intangible assets also include the recognition of the fair value of customer lists resulting from the acquisition of companies operating in the sale of natural gas and electricity that occurred in previous years, the recognition of charges paid to the awarding entities (Municipalities) and/or the outgoing operators subsequent to the assignment and/or the renewal of the relevant invitation to tender to award the service of natural gas distribution. As concerns the amortisation period: (i) the customer lists are amortised on a straight-line basis, based on the estimate of the benefits that will have
effects in future years and determined during the Purchase Price Allocation. In particular, the Directors have established that the useful life associated with customer lists is ten years, due to the low turnover rate of customers, represented mainly by civil users; (ii) the concessions for the service of natural gas distribution are amortised on a straight-line basis, based on the duration of the concession period. The amortisation period of the concessions acquired by the Ascopiave Group is equal to twelve years pursuant to the regulatory framework.
After initial recognition, intangible assets with a defined useful life are booked net of the accumulated relevant amortisation operations and net of any impairments, determined with the same basis indicated below for tangible assets. The useful life is then re-examined on an annual basis, and any changes, if necessary, made prospectively.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|127 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Assets acquired under financial leases are booked at fair value, net of taxes due by the lessee or, if lower, at the current value of the minimum lease payments, including any sum payable for the exercise of the option to purchase, in intangible assets offsetting the financial debt to the lessor. Any profits or losses deriving from the sale of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the disposal value and the book value of the asset, and are reported in the income statement at the time of the sale.
Duration and residual value of assets under concession: The gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree n. 164/00 (so-called Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, after 31st December 2012 or in the following years in the event of extension of the original deadline) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value.
Tangible fixed assets: tangible assets are booked at their historic cost, including accessory costs directly ascribable to the putting into operation of the asset for the use for which it was acquired. Lands - both free of constructions and annexed to civil and industrial buildings - were generally accounted for separately and are not depreciated since they are elements with an unlimited useful life. Maintenance and repair costs that are not subject to valuing and/or extending the residual useful life of assets, are spent in the year in which they are borne. Otherwise, they are capitalised. Tangible assets are presented net of the relevant accumulated depreciation, and any losses of value determined according to the basis described below. Amortisation is calculated in uniform instalments based on the estimated useful life of the asset for the company, which is re-examined annually, and any changes, if necessary, are made prospectively. The main economical-technical rates used are as follows:

Buildings Equipment Furniture Electronic equipment Basic hardware and software M otocars, motor vehicles and similar

2% 8,5% - 8,3%
8.80% 16.20%
20% 20%

The book value of tangible fixed assets is subject to verification in order to report any loss of value, should events or changes of situation suggest that the book value may not be recovered. Should there be an indication of this type and, in the event the book value should exceed the presumed realisation value, the assets are devalued so as to reflect their realisation value. The realisation value of the tangible fixed assets is represented by the greater of the net sales price and the value of use. Impairments are reported in the income statement with the costs for depreciation and write-downs. Such impairments are restored should the reasons for their cause cease to exist. When the asset is sold or if there are no future economic benefits expected from the use of the asset, it is eliminated from the financial statements and any loss or profit (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the book value) is entered in the income statement of the year of the above-mentioned elimination.
Shareholdings: The shareholdings recognised in this item relate to long-term investments deriving from:
- shareholdings accounted for using the equity method; - other shareholdings

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|128 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Shareholdings accounted for using the equity method: these shareholdings are in turn divided into two categories: (i) Shareholdings in joint companies: The shareholdings in joint companies, i.e. in which the Group controls the
entity with other shareholders, are accounted for using the net equity method. The profit and loss account shows the share of the Group in the operating profit of the joint company. According to the equity method, shareholdings are recognised in the balance sheet at cost, adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the net assets, net of any loss in value of individual shareholdings. The excess of acquisition cost as compared to the share attributable to the Group of the identifiable fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company at the acquisition date is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment and is subject to impairment tests.
(ii) Shareholdings in affiliate companies: The shareholdings in affiliate companies, i.e. in which the Group has a significant influence, are accounted for using the net equity method. The profit and loss account shows the share of the Group in the operating profit of the affiliate. If an affiliate company detects adjustments directly attributable to the net equity, the Group recognises its share and includes it, where applicable, in the statement of changes in the net equity.
In the event the loss attributable to the Group exceeds the book value of the shareholding, the latter is cancelled and any excess is recognised in a special fund to the extent that the Group has legal or constructive obligations towards the subsidiary to cover its losses or, however, to make payments on its behalf. If, at a later stage, the loss does no longer exist or has decreased, a reversal of an impairment loss is booked in the income statement, up to its cost.
Shareholdings in other companies: share interests in companies that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures (normally with a share interest not exceeding 20%) are classified in non-current financial assets and entered at their fair value if it can be determined. If their fair value at the date of the balance sheet cannot be determined because the related shares are not listed, they are valued at their cost of purchase or subscription, minus any repayment of principal, and are subsequently adjusted for losses in value determined in the same manner previously described for the tangible assets. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported in profit and loss (FVPL) or, if the option stated in the standard is exercised, in other comprehensive income (FVOCI) in the item "Reserve for instruments at FVOCI".
Other non-current assets: are booked at their nominal value adjusted for any losses in value, corresponding to the amortised cost.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories identified by IFRS 9:
- financial assets measured at amortised cost; - assets at fair value with the contra-item "Other components of comprehensive income" (FVOCI); - assets at fair value with the contra-item "Profit or loss for the year" (FVTPL).
Financial assets measured at amortised cost: this category includes the financial assets for which the following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is the possession of the asset aimed at the collection of contractual financial flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the asset envisage cash flows represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be returned. These mainly refer to receivables from customers and/or loans that contain a significant financial component. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financial component are instead recognised at the price defined for the related transaction. Subsequent measurements of the assets belonging to this category are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate. Any provisions for the write-down of such receivables are determined with the forward looking approach using a three-stage model: 1) recognition of expected losses in the first 12 months upon initial recognition of the receivable if the credit risk has not increased; 2) recognition of expected losses over the life of the receivable if the credit-related risk increases significantly as compared to the initial recognition; interest is recognised on a gross basis; 3) recognition of the additional losses expected over the life of the receivable as the losses occur; interest is recognised on a net basis.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|129 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Assets at fair value with the contra-item "Other components of comprehensive income" (FVOCI): financial assets with the following characteristics are classified in this category: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both through the sale of the asset itself and through the collection of contractual cash flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the asset include cash flows represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be returned. Any write-downs for permanent losses in value, interest income and gains or losses due to exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Assets at fair value with the contra-item "Profit or loss for the year" (FVTPL): this category includes all the financial assets that do not meet the conditions, in terms of business model or characteristics of the flows generated, for the purposes of measurement at amortised cost or at fair value with a contra-entry in the comprehensive income statement. The assets belonging to this category are classified under current or non-current assets according to their natural maturity and recorded at fair value upon initial recognition. During the subsequent measurement, the profits and losses deriving from changes in fair value are reported in the income statement in the period in which they are detected.
Value adjustments: financial assets are measured based on the credit loss assessment model in application of the incurred losses criterion. The Group has decided to assess the credit risk assuming a total write-down of receivables past due by over 365 days and a partial write-down of those overdue by more than 180 days already in the past. The predictive process is supported by the monthly use of the provision for doubtful accounts set aside based on the execution of cycles of reminders and recovery of outstanding receivables. The historical series relating to past years have shown that the write-down made in predictive terms is a reasonable overestimate of the actual losses that the Group incurs due to its end customers.
Inventories: inventories are booked at whichever of the following is lower: purchase and/or manufacturing cost, determined pursuant to the weighted average cost basis, or the estimated realisable net value. The net realisation value is determined based on the estimated sales price in normal market conditions, net of direct sales costs. Obsolete and/or slow to realise inventories are written down in relation to their presumed possibility of use or future realisation. The write down is eliminated in the following years, should the reasons for its cause cease to exist.
Inventories of stored natural gas: the inventories of stored natural gas, are booked at whichever of the following is lower: purchase cost including incidental expenses, determined by applying the weighted average cost, or the spot market value at the closing date of the period.
Trade receivables and other current assets: trade receivables and other current assets, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, are not discounted back and are booked at amortised cost net of the relevant value losses. These are suited to their presumed realisation value through the reporting in a specific adjustment fund, which is constituted when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to receive credit for the original value. Provisions to the reserve for doubtful accounts are reported in the income statement. Additionally, the Group sells some of its trade receivables through sale operations of receivables ("factoring"). Factoring transactions are with recourse.
Cash and cash equivalents: they include cash values, values available at sight and other short-term financial investments. They are accounted at nominal value.
Own shares: Re-acquired own shares are taken as a decrease in the assets. The original cost of own shares, revenues from sales and any other subsequent variation are recognised under the net equity.
Benefits for employees: benefits guaranteed to employees, paid when or after employment ceases, by means of programmes with defined benefits (Employees' leaving indemnities) or with other long-term benefits (retirement indemnity) are recognised in the period when the right accrues. The liability related to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognised on an accrual basis consistent with the employment period required to obtain the benefits. Defined benefit plans also include severance indemnity (TFR)
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|130 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

owed to the employees of the Group companies pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, accrued prior to the reform of this regulation occurred in 2007 (Finance Act of 27th December 2006 no. 296), subsequent to which, for companies employing more than 50 persons and for quotas accrued commencing 1st January 2007, the Severance indemnity is classified as a defined contribution plan.
The Group's obligations are separately determined for each plan, by estimating the present value of future benefits that employees have accrued during the current year and in previous financial periods. This calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. The components of the defined benefits are recognised as follows:
(i) the re-measurement components of liabilities, which include actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income (loss);
(ii) costs related to the provision of services are recognised in the profit and loss statement; (iii) net financial charges in the defined benefit liability are recognised in the income statement. The re-measurement components recognised in Other comprehensive income (loss) are never reclassified in the profit and loss statement of the following years. For the Severance indemnity accrued after 1st January 2007, the company is only required to pay contributions to the State (so-called Fondo INPS) or to a trust fund or a legally separate entity (so-called Fund) and is determined based on contributions due. Moreover, the Group has signed compensation plans partly based on Ascopiave S.p.A. shares and settled through the delivery of shares (stock option plans, long-term incentive plans), recognised as liabilities and measured at fair value at the end of each accounting period and up to the time of payment (approval of 2017 financial statements). Any subsequent change in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss statement. The remaining part of the plan instead is paid in the form of options that can only be sold for cash. The cost of cash operations is evaluated initially at the fair value as of the date of allocation. In particular, the plans adopted by the Group include the allocation of rights including acknowledgement in favour of the beneficiaries of an extraordinary payment linked to the achievement of pre-set objectives, the financial settlement of which is based on the trend of the share title. This fair value is booked in the period until maturation with reporting of a corresponding payable. The liability is re-calculated upon each reporting date, until the date of settlement, with all changes made to the fair value reported in the income statement. In 2019, the compensation plans relating to the 2018 ­ 2020 three-year period accrued in part; as a consequence, reserves for the portions to be settled by share-based payments were established. Pursuant to the rules governing the plan, there were no other allocations in the period, since the benefits will accrue at the end of the financial year. These compensation plans are accounted for in compliance with the requirements set out in IFRS 2. For more details on the compensations paid during the year 2019, please refer to "Section II" of the Remuneration Report, prepared pursuant to Art. 123-ter, Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 (TUF).
Provisions for risks and charges: The provisions for risks and charges concern costs and charges of a given type, and of certain or probable existence, which on the closing date of the financial year are undetermined in terms of amount or due date. Provisions are reported when:
i) There likely is a current obligation (legal or implicit) that derives from a past event; ii) An outlay of resources is likely in order to meet the obligation; iii) A reasonable estimate can be made as to the amount of the obligation. On the other hand, where it is not possible to carry out a probable estimate as to the obligation, or alternatively, it is deemed that the outlay of financial resources is only possible and not probably, the relevant potential liability is not entered in the financial statements, but rather mentioned appropriately in the explanatory notes. Provisions are reported at the representative value of the best estimate of the amount that the company would pay to extinguish the obligation, or to transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. If the effect of discounting is significant, the allocations are determined by discounting back the expected future financial flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the market's current valuation in relation to time. When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the passing of time is reported as a financial charge.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|131 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Financial liabilities: financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments, include the medium and longterm loans recorded initially at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred and, subsequently, measured at amortised cost, calculated by applying the effective interest rate, net of principal repayments already made. When a condition of a long-term financing contract is violated, on or before the date of the financial statements, causing the liability to become payable on demand, the liability is classified as current, even if the lender has agreed - after the reference date of the financial statements and before the authorisation for its publishing - not to require the payment because of the breach. The liability is classified as current because, as of the date of the financial statements, the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for at least twelve months after that date.
Trade payables and other payables: trade payables, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, refer to financial liabilities resulting from trade transactions and are recognised at amortised cost. Payables in a currency other than the account currency are booked at the exchange rate of the day of the transaction and, subsequently, are converted at the exchange rate as of the date of financial statements. Any profit or loss deriving from conversion is reported in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments: the Group holds derivative instruments for the purposes of hedging its exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates with reference to two loans taken out during 2019 at a variable rate. The instruments used to manage the risk related to the volatility of goods prices basically consist in Interest Rate Swap agreements, aimed at avoiding impacts on the income statement deriving from changes in the interest rates to which the financial charges of the abovementioned loan agreements are indexed. The transactions which, pursuant to risk management policies, satisfy the requirements of the international accounting standards for hedge accounting, are classified as "hedging transactions" (and recognised as set out below). On the contrary, those which, despite having hedging purposes, do not meet the requirements envisaged by the international standards, are classified as "trading transactions". In this event, the changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur. The fair value is determined based on the reference market value.
Derivatives embedded in financial assets/liabilities are separated and assessed at fair value, except for cases where the strike price of the derivative at the starting date is close to the value determined based on the amortised cost of the reference asset/liability. In this event, the valuation of the embedded derivative is absorbed in the valuation of the asset/financial liability. The fair value measurement of the above-mentioned contracts is performed by using pricing models and based on market data as at 31st December 2019.
Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy based on the methods for determining the fair value itself, or based on the relevance of the information (input) used in determining their value:
(i) Level 1, financial instruments whose fair value is determined on the basis of a price listed in an active market;
(ii) Level 2, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which can be observed directly or indirectly on the market. This category includes instruments valued on the basis of market forward curves and short-term contracts for difference;
(iii) Level 3, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which cannot be observed on the market, that is using exclusively internal estimates.
The Group, as of 31st December 2019 has only one type of financial instruments on interest rates falling within the scope of level 1.
Revenues and costs: revenues and costs are booked on an accrual basis.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|132 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The recognition of revenue from contracts with customers is based on the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract with the customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations, represented by the contractual promises to transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations identified on the basis of the stand-alone selling price of each good or service; (v) recognition of the revenue when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled, i.e. when the promised good or service is transferred to the customer; the transfer is considered completed when the customer obtains control of the good or service, which can occur continuously (over time) or at a specific time (at a point in time). Depending on the type of operation, revenues are entered based on the following specific criteria: (i) the revenues from natural gas transportation are recognised at the time when the supply or the service are
provided - although not yet invoiced - and are determined by combining estimates with the values recorded during the financial year based on the so-called reference tariffs, in order to determine the restriction on total revenues as provided for by the regulations issued by the ARERA; (ii) the contributions received by users for connection services or for parcelling works, if not in relation to costs incurred into for network extension, are reported in the income statement; (iii) the revenues for service performance are recognised regarding the level of completion of the activity, based on the same criteria applied to works performed upon order. In case it is impossible to determine their value, the revenues will not be not booked until the amounts of the costs incurred into are deemed recovered; (iv) Revenues are entered net of all discounts, rebates and premiums, as well as the taxes directly connected.
Public contributions: public contributions are reported when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be received and all relevant conditions are met. When public contributions are linked to costs components, they are reported as income, but are systematically divided up over the periods, to be measured to the costs they are intended to offset. In case the contribution is related to an asset, the asset and the contribution are recorded at their nominal value and their recording into the income statement is accounted for progressively along the useful life of the reference asset, with constant shares.
Private contributions: it should be noted that private contributions received up to 31st December 2013 for the construction of connections to users were fully entered in the income statement when the costs for their construction were incurred and the work was commissioned. The contributions received for the construction of these works that were not related to the costs incurred for their construction were suspended in liabilities and recognised in the income statement when the conditions were fulfilled. The private contributions received for the construction of connections to users are recorded from 1st January 2014 in liabilities at the moment of payment and recorded to the income statement from the date of connection construction, consistent with the recognition of costs to which the works refer and their useful life.
Financial income and expenses: income and costs are booked on an accrual basis according to the interest accrued on the net value of the relevant financial assets and liabilities, using the actual interest rate.
Income taxes: current taxes are calculated based on an estimate of the income before tax and are entered at the amount that is expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. The rates and tax regulations used to calculate the amount are those issued or basically issued upon year end. Current taxation relating to elements reported directly under assets are reported directly as assets and under the other items of the comprehensive income statement. As far as the Tax on Company Revenue is concerned (IRES), Ascopiave S.p.A.'s subsidiaries (AP Reti Gas S.p.A., AP Reti Gas Rovigo S.r.l., AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A., Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., Asco Energy S.p.A.) benefited of the national tax consolidation regime pursuant to art. 117/129 of the Unified Law on Revenue Taxes (TUIR) for the 2020 ­ 2022 three-year period. This option enables the calculation of IRES based on a taxable amount equalling to the mathematical sum of the positive and negative taxable amounts of the single companies that comprise the consolidation. Ascopiave S.p.A. acts as consolidating company and determines a single taxable amount for the entire group of companies that are part of the national consolidation regime. Each of the participating companies transfers its income tax (taxable income or tax loss) to the consolidating company recognising therefore in the income statement the item "tax consolidation charges" or "tax consolidation income" for
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|133 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

an amount equal to the current IRES rate for the financial year (or the loss transferred), that will be paid or used by the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A.. Deferred tax assets are reported against all deductible temporary differences and for tax assets and liabilities brought forward, to the extent that the existence of suitable future tax income that enables the use of deductible temporary differences and tax assets and liabilities brought forward is probable, except for the following:
(i) when deferred payable tax assets connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial reporting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a company merger and that, at the time of the transaction itself, has no effect on the profit of the year calculated for the purposes of the statements, nor on the profit or loss calculated for tax purposes;
(ii) regarding taxable temporary differences associated with holdings in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, the deferred tax assets are reported only in the amount in which it is probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the immediate future and that there is suitable tax income against which the temporary differences can be used.
Earnings per share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares net of own shares. For the purposes of the calculation of the basic earnings per share, we specify that the numerator is the economic result for the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profits for shares result as equal to those for shares in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to provide estimates and assumptions based on complex and/or subjective judgments, estimates based on experience and assumptions deemed to be reasonable and realistic based on information available at the time of the estimate. This affects the values of the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated financial statements, as well as costs and revenues and information relating to potential assets and liabilities as of that date. If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions, which are based on the management's best assessment, differ from the actual circumstances, they shall be modified so as to be appropriate in the period in which the circumstances arise. Estimates are used to report: - Duration and residual value of the goods in concession: the gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession,
i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above-mentioned industrial value. Estimates are also used to assess the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry; - - Impairments of non-financial assets: At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are impairments of all non-financial assets. Goodwill is tested for possible impairments at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this requires an estimate of use value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting based on a suitable discount rate. As of 31st December 2019, the book value of goodwill amounted to Euro 47,914 thousand (2018: Euro 80,758 thousand). Further details can be found under Note 1; - Provisions for risks on receivables, obsolete inventories, the useful lives of intangible and tangible fixed assets and related amortisation and depreciation, employee benefits and payment plans based on stock options (socalled phantom stock option), taxes and provisions for risks and charges. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the variations are immediately reflected in the income statement. In applying the Group accounting principles, the Directors have taken decisions based on the stated
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|134 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

discretional evaluations, with a significant effect on the values reported on the statements. However, the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and estimates may determine results that, in the future, will need to be significantly adjusted at the book value of such assets and/or liabilities.
Impairment of assets The Group performs at least once a year an impairment test on tangible and intangible assets if their useful lives are indefinite or, more often, in the presence of events suggesting that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this test requires an estimate of use value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is assigned, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting based on a suitable discount rate.
Energy Efficiency Certificates The Energy Efficiency Certificates purchased during the year are recognised in the income statement at the cost incurred. The portion of certificates not yet purchased but needed to achieve the target of the financial year is recognised at the current market value of the price of the certificates themselves. The relevant contribution that will be paid by CSEA upon the cancellation of the certificates is entered in the item "revenues" at the current value of the contribution itself determined on the basis of the repayment price expected at the end of the year.
Amortisation and depreciation Amortisation and depreciation are calculated based on the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the concession; the useful life is determined by the directors, with the assistance of technical experts, when the asset is entered in the financial statements; the assessments about the duration of the useful lives are based on historical experience, market conditions and expectations of future events that could affect the useful life, including technological innovations. On a regular basis, the company evaluates technological and sector changes, dismantling and close-down charges and the recovery value in order to update the asset's remaining useful life. This periodic update may lead to a change in the depreciation/amortisation period and thus the depreciation/amortisation quota for future periods.
Duration and residual value of assets under concession: The gas distribution activity is carried out as a concession, i.e. the local public bodies entrust the supply of the service to the company. Regarding the duration of concessions, Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (so-called Letta Decree) stated that all concessions should be put to tender by the end of the "transitional period" (for the Ascopiave Group, between 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2012) and that the new term of the concessions will not exceed twelve years. On expiry of the concessions, the operator, upon the sale of its distribution networks, except for assets to be relinquished, receives compensation as defined by the criteria of the industrial estimate. In relation to the estimates made by management for determining the depreciation method, the net book value of assets at the expiration of the concession should not be higher than the above mentioned industrial value. Estimates are also used to assess the effects of disputes on the application of distribution and/or sale tariffs, and those with the municipalities for the acknowledgement of the redemption value of assets as under the concession, returned upon its expiry.
Provisions for risks These provisions have been devised by adopting the same procedures as in the previous years and by referring to the updated reports prepared by the lawyers and consultants who are examining the disputes, as well as based on the procedural developments of the latter.
Provision for doubtful accounts The provision for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated losses connected with the receivables of the company. Provisions have been established to cover specific cases of insolvency, as well as in relation to expected bad debts estimated based on experience with respect to receivables with a similar risk profile.

COMMENTS ON THE MAIN CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEM
Non-current assets
1. Goodwill
Goodwill, equal to Euro 47,914 thousand as of 31st December 2019, shows a decrease compared to 31st December 2018 of Euro 32,845 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the effects of the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 with the Hera Group involving the transfer of the sales companies consolidated by the Ascopiave Group up to that date and the purchase of the new gas distribution company AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l.. The transfer of the sales companies resulted in the divestiture of their goodwill for a total of Euro 56,362 thousand. This change was partially offset by the goodwill recognised subsequent to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A., for Euro 9,368 thousand, and the purchase of the entire share capital of the newly established company AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l. for Euro 14,149 thousand, both better described in the "Business combinations" chapter herein. With regard to the latter, please note that the allocation made will be subject to further investigation and verification in order to determine, within the annual deadline set forth in the accounting standards, the definitive recognition of the business combination. Net of the effects described, goodwill did not change. This amount refers in part to the surplus value created by the delivery of the gas distribution networks by partner municipalities in the period between 1996 and 1999, and in part to the surplus value paid during the acquisition of some business units related to the distribution of natural gas.
Pursuant to International Accounting Standard 36, goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but its impairment is verified at least annually.
In order to determine the recoverable amount, the goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Unit composed of the natural gas distribution activity (gas distribution CGU). The goodwill consequently recorded at the reporting date only concerns the gas distribution CGU as shown in the following table:

(Thousands of Euro) Distribution of natural gas Sales of natural gas Total goodwill

31.12.2019 47,914 (0) 47,914

31.12.2018 24,396 56,362 80,758

The impairment test on goodwill has been carried out by comparing the recoverable value of the activities of natural gas distribution with their accounting value, including the goodwill allocated to them. As no reliable criteria exist to evaluate the sale value between the aware and available parties in the activity of gas distribution, other than the criteria put forward in literature to evaluate business units, the recoverable value of the tested assets is determined by using the value-in-use for all the Group's CGUs.
The recoverable amount of gas distribution CGU has been estimated using the Discounted Cash Flow method, discounting the operating financial flows generated by the assets themselves at a discount rate representative of the cost of capital. The financial flows used to calculate the recoverable amount cover the forecasts formulated by the management in the Economic and Financial Plan for the 2020-2022 period approved with resolution of the Board of Directors dated 28th February 2020.
The current sector legislation establishes that the natural gas distribution service is awarded by means of tender procedures in the minimum territorial areas within pre-established time limits.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|136 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The tenders for the award of the service in the territorial areas where the Group currently holds most of its municipal concessions, if the deadlines for issuing the calls for tenders illustrated in the regulations had been respected, would have already started. As of today, the only call for tenders affecting the concessions currently held by the Ascopiave Group concerns the Vicenza 3 territorial area. The Economic and Financial Plan - and consequently also the assessment methods adopted to determine the use value of the gas distribution CGU - assumes that the Group, during the three-year period 2020-2022, will maintain the management of the current portfolio of concessions.
Regarding the activity of gas distribution, it was hypothesised that in the 2020-2022 period the management would generate financial flows in line with those envisaged in the 2020-2022 Economic and Financial Plan while, considering the uncertainty that bears on the renewal of concessions, it has been decided to estimate the final value of the gas distribution CGU by assuming two alternative scenarios: - scenario 1: The Group obtains in 2022 the renewal of all the concessions and assignments in effect on 31st
December 2019; - scenario 2: The Group ends the activity of gas distribution in 2022, realising the reimbursement value of the
plants as per Art. 15 of Legislative Decree no 164/2000.
Regarding scenario 1, the terminal value has been estimated as an estimate of perpetuity as from the last year specified in the financial forecasts, and considering the economic terms and conditions of the renewals.
The growth factor (g) used for the purpose of calculating the terminal value, has been estimated at 1.46% (1.69% as of 31st December 2018) in line with the inflation rate forecasts elaborated for Italy by the International Monetary Fund.
The cost of capital (WACC) of the gas distribution CGU was calculated assuming: a) a beta unlevered coefficient, as indicated by ARERA in Resolution 639/2018/R/com dated 6th December 2018 and
subsequent update contained in the Resolution ARERA 570/2019/R/gas dated 27th December 2019 and its annex; b) the level of financial leverage (ratio between financial debt and own means) is in line with the financial structure
for the gas distribution sector presumed by ARERA in Resolution 639/2018/R/com dated 6th December 2018; c) an equity risk premium equal to 5.5% (5.5% as of 31st December 2018), based on authoritative academic sources,
professional practices, market consensus and the guidance provided by Organismo Italiano di Valutazione (OIV); d) the Risk-Free Rate adopted - equal to the annual average of net yields on 10-year government bonds as of 31st
December 2019; e) the cost of debt determined on the basis of the indications provided by ARERA in resolution 639/2018/R/com
dated 6th December 2018; f) an additional risk premium in order to calculate the cost of equity, consistent with the impairment test
performed last year; to take into account the uncertainty relating to the timing and outcome of the tenders through which the concessions will be awarded, two scenarios were formulated. The minimum scenario envisages an additional risk premium of 1%, while the maximum scenario an additional premium of 2% (1% as of 31st December 2018).
Based on these elements, the average weighted cost of the post-tax capital is equal to 5.16% (5.57% as of 31st December 2018). This rate has been used for discounting cash flows in the period provided for by the 2020-2022 Plan.
The cost of capital used to determine the value of the perpetuity and the rate of discounting of the terminal value is equal to 5.72% (6.12% as of 31st December 2018) and was calculated based on the above parameters and providing for an additional risk premium for the calculation of the cost of equity (Ke) of 2% (2% as of 31st December 2018) to consider the uncertainty on the possible renewal of the concessions and their conditions of renewal.
On the basis of these elements, the recoverable value of the gas distribution CGU is higher than the accounting values and therefore the conditions are not met to write down the goodwill for impairment.
The results obtained have undergone sensitivity tests, in order to find out how the result of this assessment process might vary depending on the change of profitability parameters assumed in future cash flows, of the growth rate considered upon determining the terminal value or of the discount rate to discount the cash flows. This analysis has
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|137 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

led the Directors to evaluate that the expected cash flows can absorb normal variations of the parameters highlighted with respect to the sensitivity analyses generally performed in assessment practice.
The Directors have identified - in scenario 1 - which discount rate value and which variation in EBITDA considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 6.4% (7.48% as of 31st December 2018), or an average decrease in EBITDA equal to 9.7% (18.2% as of 31st December 2018).
The Directors have finally identified - in scenario 2 - which discount rate value and which variation in plants reimbursement values considered upon performing the impairment test could result in a use value equal to the book value of the net assets associated with the Distribution CGU. This additional sensitivity analysis has led to identify the breakeven point of the CGU with a discount rate of 7.2% (11.8% as of 31st December 2018), or an average decrease in reimbursement values equal to 7.9% (21.6% as of 31st December 2018).
The estimate of the recoverable value of the cash generating units requires discretion and the use of estimates by the management. Several factors related to the evolution of the difficult regulatory context could require a reassessment of any impairment losses. The circumstances and events that could cause a further verification of impairment losses are constantly monitored by the Company.
Upon transfer to AP Reti Gas S.p.A. of the gas distribution activities, Ascopiave S.p.A. became a share interest holding that carries out direction and strategic coordination activities in the Ascopiave Group. Pursuant to IAS 36 accounting standard, we verified the recoverability of the so-called "corporate assets" of Ascopiave S.p.A. i.e. the assets and liabilities related to the main Ascopiave S.p.A. assets that have not been allocated in the CGUs during the first level impairment tests. The test has been carried out on a consolidation level (second level test) as prescribed in IAS 36. We verified the net invested consolidated capital of Ascopiave, net of un-consolidated share interests. Specifically, the recoverable amount has been determined as the sum of the following: i) recoverable amount of the CGUs gas distribution, gas sale and activities that were deemed as primary during the first level impairment test and ii) the recoverable amount of company Ascopiave. In both cases the value-in-use value configuration was used.
About the recoverable amount of Ascopiave, the cash flows used are consistent with the forecasts set forth by company management for the years. The terminal value has been determined as an estimate of a perpetuity based on results expected for 2022.
The growth factor (g) used for the purpose of calculating the terminal value, has been estimated at 1.46% (1.69% as of 31st December 2018) in line with the inflation rate forecasts elaborated for Italy by the International Monetary Fund.
The weighted cost of capital (WACC) was estimated as the weighted average of WACC amounts calculated for each CGU, where weighting factors weight in percentage over the Operating Results of each CGU for the entire Operating Result of 2019.
We calculated that the recoverable amount determined with these parameters is higher than the accounting values and therefore it is not necessary to write down Goodwill.
Regarding cogeneration/heat supply, it was hypothesised that in the period 2020-2022 the management would generate financial flows in line with those envisaged in the 2020-2022 Economic and Financial Plan. The Terminal Value cash flow was calculated in such a way as to represent the level of cash generation sustainable in the long run by the CGU. In particular, the Terminal Value EBITDA was determined on the basis of the EBITDA forecast in 2022 and no changes in the net working capital and in the provisions for risks and charges were assumed. The growth factor g has been estimated at 1.46%, in line with the inflation rate forecasts elaborated for Italy by the International Monetary Fund. Based on these elements, the recoverable amount of the cogeneration/heat supply CGU is higher than the accounting values and therefore it is not necessary to write down Goodwill for impairment.

The extension of the scope of consolidation, due to the merger through acquisition effective 1st July 2019 of the previously jointly controlled company Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l and the first consolidation of the newly established company AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l. acquired in the context of the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 with the Hera Group, determined the recognition of the fixed assets of both companies with the consequent increase in other intangible assets of Euro 206,796 thousand. This amount is attributable for Euro 44,025 thousand to the first combination and for Euro 162,771 thousand to the second. The investments made during the financial year, considering the same consolidation scope, amount to Euro 33,149 thousand and refer to costs incurred for the realisation of the infrastructures for natural gas distribution.

Industrial patents and intellectual property rights During the period considered, the item "Industrial patents and intellectual property rights" registered investments for Euro 863 thousand. They are mainly explained by the costs incurred for the replacement and implementation of the user management software employed by the Group's distribution companies. Subsequent to the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 with the Hera Group, the Group's sales companies are not controlled by the Ascopiave Group and the consequent deconsolidation resulted in a decrease in the item of Euro 18 thousand.

Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights This item includes costs paid to awarding entities (Municipalities) and/or outgoing operators after the award and/or the renewal of the relevant tenders for the assignment of the natural gas distribution service, rather than the costs incurred for the acquisition of licences. During the year, the item did not register increases and the variation is explained by amortisation. The assignments obtained, following the implementation of Legislative Decree no. 164/00 (Letta Decree), are amortised with a useful life of 12 years in compliance with the period provided for by the decree.

Other intangible fixed assets During the year, the item did not record investments and the change is mainly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation and the deconsolidation of the sales companies involved in the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019. Net of these changes, the decrease in the net value of the item is explained by amortisation.
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Leased plants and machinery The item reports the costs incurred into for the construction of facilities and distribution network of natural gas, the related connections as well as for the installation of metering and reduction groups. At the end of the first nine months of the year, net of the extension of the scope of consolidation, the overall net change amounts to Euro 6,050 thousand, mainly explained by depreciation for the period and the investments made. The investments, including the reclassifications of assets under construction, totalled Euro 26,790 thousand. Net divestments are mainly related to the mass replacement of meters. The infrastructures located in Municipalities in which the invitation to tender for the distribution of natural gas has not been launched, are depreciated by applying the lower amount between the technical life of plants and the useful life indicated by the ARERA in tariff regulations. The technical life of plants has been assessed by an independent external expert who has determined the technical obsolescence of the infrastructures.

Intangible assets under construction under concession The item includes the costs incurred for the building of the natural gas distribution plants and systems constructed partially on a time and materials basis and not completed at the end of the first nine months of the year. The item, net of the extension of the scope of consolidation, has changed by Euro 5,088 thousand.

Intangible assets under construction The item includes the costs incurred for the purchase and development of management software not completed at the end of the year and related to the core business of natural gas distribution.

|140 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The investments made during the year, considering the same consolidation scope, amount to Euro 1,655 thousand and mainly relate to the costs incurred for the purchase of other assets.
Land and buildings This item is mainly made up of the buildings owned in relation to company offices, peripheral offices and warehouses. During the year, the item did not register investments and the variation, considering the same consolidation scope, is explained by depreciation. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in the item of Euro 1,419 thousand.
Plants and machinery The item "Plants and machinery" registered a decrease of Euro 73 thousand mainly explained, considering the same consolidation scope, by the depreciation for the period. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in the item of Euro 7 thousand.
Industrial and commercial equipment The item "Industrial and commercial equipment", considering the same consolidation scope, registered investments equal to Euro 142 thousand. It includes costs incurred for the purchase of equipment for the maintenance service of the distribution plants and for metering activity. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in the item of Euro 119 thousand.
Other assets The investments made during financial year, considering the same consolidation scope, are equal to Euro 1,089 thousand and they mainly relate to the costs incurred for the purchase of hardware and phones (Euro 835 thousand) as well as furniture and fittings (Euro 21 thousand). The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in the item of Euro 380 thousand.
Tangible assets under construction and advance payments The item mainly includes costs incurred for extraordinary maintenance of company headquarters and/or peripheral warehouses. During the year, the item changed by Euro 352 thousand.
Rights of use The item includes the rights of use related to the first application of IFRS 16 on 1st January 2019. The effect of the application of the new standard mainly concerned operating leases relating to tangible fixed assets: lease of buildings (Euro 590 thousand), rental of vehicles and trucks (Euro 401 thousand). During the year, the change recorded by the item, net of the first recognition at the amortised cost of the commitments, amounts to Euro 275 thousand, equal to the depreciation for the period.

During the year, the item "Equity investments" recorded significant changes due to the corporate transactions developed during the year and described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" of this financial report. In chronological order, the expansion of the scope of consolidation occurred with the merger through acquisition of

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|141 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A. on 1st July 2019, and the completion of the partnership with the Hera Group on 19th December 2019. The first determined the acquisition of control of the entire company by Ascopiave S.p.A. and its consequent line-byline consolidation commencing 1st July 2019. The second involved the transfer to the new EstEnergy S.p.A. of the sales activities of the Ascopiave Group (Ascotrade S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A. and the joint ventures Asm Set S.r.l. and Etra Energia S.r.l.), the stake in Sinergie Italiane S.r.l., and those of the Hera Group (Hera Comm Nord-Est S.r.l.). 52% of the share capital of the new EstEnergy is held by the Hera Group and 48% by Ascopiave (which acquired its share, at the price described above, on the basis of an equity value of 100% of EstEnergy equal to Euro 824,881 thousand). As regards the reorganisation of the gas distribution activities, Ascopiave acquired a scope of concessions from the Hera Group, including users in Veneto and in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, which were transferred commencing 31st December 2019 to the newly established company called AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l., of which it holds 100% of the share capital and which is consequently consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Finally, as required by the agreement signed at the end of July, 3% of the capital of Hera Comm was acquired by Ascopiave, at a price of Euro 54 thousand.
Equity investments in joint companies Investments in joint companies amounted to zero at the end of the year, with a net change of Euro 68,355 thousand. The change is explained by the corporate transactions developed during the year and described in the previous paragraph and, specifically, the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A. occurred on 1st July 2019 which resulted in the acquisition of control of the entire company by the parent company and its consequent consolidation on a line-by-line basis. The results achieved up to 30th June 2019 are therefore recorded in the item "Companies measured with the equity method" of this report, whereas the operating results and the balance sheet figures of the second half of the current year are represented by nature in the consolidated schedules. The residual investments in jointly controlled companies were deconsolidated following their sale in the context of the partnership with the Hera Group. The sale of these companies, relating to the investments in EstEnergy S.p.A. and in Asm Set S.r.l., determined a decrease in the item totalling Euro 44,789 thousand.
Equity investments in affiliate companies At the end of the year, investments in affiliate companies were recorded for a total of Euro 395,943 thousand, an amount entirely related to the 48% stake held in EstEnergy S.p.A., in its new configuration. At the reporting date, in fact, the sales activities of the Ascopiave Group (Ascotrade S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A. and the joint ventures Asm Set S.r.l. and Etra Energia S.r.l.) and the stake in Sinergie Italiane S.r.l., and those of the Hera Group (Hera Comm Nord-Est Srl) were transferred to the new company. 52% of the share capital of the new EstEnergy is held by the Hera Group and 48% by Ascopiave (which acquired its share, at the price described above, on the basis of an equity value of 100% of EstEnergy equal to Euro 824,881 million).
Other investments At the end of the year, other equity investments recorded a change of Euro 54,000 thousand. The change is related to the acquisition of 3% of the share capital of Hera Comm already described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" of this financial report, which should be consulted for more information. The remaining equity investments, equal to Euro 2 thousand, relate to Banca di Credito Cooperativo delle Prealpi Soc. Coop. for Euro 1 thousand and Banca Alto Vicentino S.p.A. for Euro 1 thousand. Please note that Ascopiave S.p.A. has put options on the investments in associates and on the stake acquired in Hera Comm and that, at the end of the year, their fair value was null.

5. Other non-current assets The following table shows the breakdown of "Other non-current assets" at the end of each period considered:

(Thousands of Euro) Security deposits Other receivables Other non-current assets

31.12.2019 1,171 2,125 3,296

31.12.2018 8,917 3,127
12,044

Non-current assets recorded an overall change compared to the previous year equal to Euro 8,747 thousand. This is mainly explained by the deconsolidation of the sales companies involved in the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 with the Hera Group which resulted in a decrease in the item of Euro 7,841 thousand. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in the item for Euro 100 thousand. Net of the changes described, the item decreased by Euro 980 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the reclassification under non-current and current financial assets of the receivable from the municipality of Costabissara with which a settlement agreement was entered into, better commented in the paragraph "non-current financial assets" herein. Non-current receivables recognised at the end of the year refer to guarantee deposits for Euro 1,171 thousand and other receivables for Euro 2,125 thousand. The latter also include the receivable from the municipality of Santorso, equal to Euro 748 thousand. The value corresponds to the net book value of the distribution plants delivered in August 2007 to the same municipality; the delivery of said infrastructures occurred following the date of expiry of the concession, on 31st December 2006. The value of the receivables from the municipality corresponds to what the municipality of Santorso has been asked to pay as per the "Letta" legislative decree, article 15, paragraph 5, as indemnification of the industrial value of the network, in line with the estimations outlined in a suitable appraisal. As of 31st December 2019 there is an on-going litigation with the municipality mentioned, in order to define the value of compensation of distribution systems delivered. The Group, also following the opinion of the legal advisor, believes that the result of the litigation and arbitration procedures is uncertain. The evolution of these disputes can be found in the paragraph "Litigations" of these financial statements.

6. Non-current financial assets The table below shows the balance of non-current financial assets at the end of each reporting period:

(Thousands of Euro) Other receivables of a financial nature over 12 months Non-current financial assets

31.12.2019 2,478 2,478

31.12.2018 1,122 1,122

Non-current financial assets increased from Euro 1,122 thousand in 2018, to Euro 2,478 thousand in the period in question, showing an increase of Euro 1,356 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of the receivable due 12 months after the reporting date from the municipality of Costabissara with which a settlement agreement was signed for assessing the value of the natural gas distribution infrastructure, which had been delivered on 1st October 2011. The parties agreed an amount of Euro 3,000 thousand, of which Euro 1,000 thousand to be paid within 30 days of signing the agreement, while the remainder will be paid in 12 annual instalments having the same amount. The value entered under non-current financial assets represents the portion due beyond 12 months from the reporting date and, due to the duration of the agreed instalments, the item was discounted.

7. Advance tax receivables The following table highlights the balance of advance tax receivables at the end of each period considered:

(Thousands of Euro) Advance tax receivables Advance tax receivables

31.12.2019 19,390 19,390

31.12.2018 11,358 11,358

Advance taxes increase from Euro 11,358 thousand to Euro 19,390 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 8,033 thousand mainly attributable to the extension of the scope of consolidation which resulted in an increase in the item of Euro 7,626 thousand. This effect was partially offset by the deconsolidation of the deferred tax assets recorded by the sales companies involved in the partnership with the Hera Group which led to a decrease in the item totalling Euro 351 thousand. Net of the effects described, the item increased by Euro 762 thousand. In calculating the taxes, reference was made to the IRES rate and, where applicable, to the IRAP rate in force, in relation to the tax period which includes the date of 31st December 2019 and at the time when it is estimated that any temporary differences will be carried forward.
The item is broken down as follows in the years shown for comparison purposes:

Description Allocation of bad debt provisions Allocation of inventory write-down Amortizations IRES 24% + IRAP 4,2% Risks fund Exceeding amortizations over 2013 Other IRES 24% + IRAP 4,2% PILT - Phatom stock option - risks fund Risks fund Other IRES 24% IRES 24% exceeding amortizations Other - gas sale IRES 24% + 3,9% Total advance taxes

As of 31st December 2019, inventories are equal to Euro 8,132 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 2,112 thousand as compared to 31st December 2018, mainly explained by the increase in the amount of material as well as the extension of the scope of consolidation which resulted in an increase in inventories of fuels and materials in stock for Euro 592 thousand. The item Gas in stock amounts to 0 compared to Euro 2,659 thousand in the previous year, mainly explained by the deconsolidation of the sales companies involved in the partnership which led to a decrease in the item of the same amount. Goods in stock are used for maintenance works or for the construction of distribution plants. In the latter case materials are reclassified as Tangible Fixed Assets once installation is complete. Inventories are entered net of the provision for loss in value of stock, equal to Euro 39 thousand, in order to adapt their value to the opportunities for their clearance or use.

9. Trade receivables The following table shows how the item is broken down for each period considered:

(Thousands of Euro)

31.12.2019

18,966 24,665
(506) 43,124

76,617 94,046 (3,715) 166,947

Trade receivables decreased from Euro 166,947 thousand to Euro 43,124 thousand, marking a decrease of Euro 123,823 thousand. This is mainly explained by the deconsolidation of the gas and energy sales companies involved in the partnership with the Hera Group which resulted in a decrease in the item of Euro 135,564 thousand. The extension of the scope of consolidation, on the other hand, determined the recognition of higher receivables for Euro 1,708 thousand. Net of the effects described, the item increased by Euro 10,031 thousand mainly due to the seasonality of the business. The trade receivables consist mainly in receivables from the natural gas sales companies that work in the area where the gas distribution network managed by the Group companies is located. The expansion of the portfolio of users served resulted in the recognition of greater transport services due to the consumption of the end customers in autumn and winter, a period in which natural gas consumption is concentrated. Receivables from customers are expressed net of the billing down payments and are payable within the following 12 months. The provision for doubtful accounts mainly included the amounts set aside for risks on receivables suffered by the companies selling natural gas and electricity. The remainder, equal to Euro 506 thousand represents the risks of the Group distribution companies and did not require additional amounts due to the good capacity of the existing provisions. The increase recorded is ascribable to the extension of the scope of consolidation for Euro 39 thousand.

The changes in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2019 are shown in the following table.

Other current assets increase from Euro 45,062 thousand to Euro 46,830 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 1,768 thousand. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in an increase in other assets of Euro 3,581 thousand, influencing in particular the receivables from Cassa Servizi Energetici e Ambientali (CSEA). On the other hand, the deconsolidation of the sales companies, as a result of the transaction described in "Significant events during FY 2019", determined a decrease in the item of Euro 4,362 thousand affecting mainly the receivables from the Technical Offices of Finance, Regions and Provinces in relation to regional excise duties and additional taxes. Net of the effects described, the item showed an increase compared to 31st December 2019 of Euro 2,549 thousand mainly attributable to the higher receivables from Cassa Servizi Energetici ed ambientali in relation to energy efficiency certificates. In 2019, the national tax consolidation contract with Asco Holding S.p.A. ceased due to the lack of some necessary requirements. The receivables recorded refer to previous positions and do not relate to taxes accrued during the year. In 2019, the Group companies joined the national tax consolidation agreement with Ascopiave S.p.A.. The receivables from the CSEA, equal to Euro 32,658 thousand with the same consolidation scope, are calculated based on the quantities of energy efficiency certificates delivered in November 2019, but not collected at the

reporting date, and the quantities accrued with respect to the 2019 target (regulatory period June 2019-May 2020). The unit contribution used for the economic quantification of the fulfilment is equal to the final contribution communicated by the GSE for the 2019 target (regulatory period June 2018 - May 2019) in relation to the certificates delivered, and equal to the fair value of the forecast contribution for the contributions being accrued and, as of 31st December 2019, equal to Euro 250 (Euro 250 as of 31st December 2018; source STX).

Current financial assets increased by Euro 6,013 thousand, from Euro 981 thousand at 31st December 2018 to Euro 6,993 thousand in the period in question. The increase is mainly related to the deconsolidation of the companies involved in the partnership with the Hera Group. The intercompany current account relationships with them were in fact eliminated at the end of the previous year. These positions closed during the first quarter of the current year. At the end of the period, the item also included, in addition to the short-term portion of the receivables from the municipality of Creazzo, the short-term portion of the receivables, amounting to Euro 305 thousand from the municipality of Costabissara, with which the settlement agreement better described in the paragraph "non-current financial assets" herein was reached.

The deconsolidation of the sales companies subsequent to the partnership with the Hera Group determined a decrease in the item of Euro 308 thousand. Net of the changes described, the item increased by Euro 41 thousand. The item includes the residual credit, minus the taxes for 2019, of the IRAP advances paid and the IRES advances.

Consolidated shareholders' equity at 31st December 2019 amounted to Euro 873,492 thousand, marking an increase compared to 2018 of Euro 425,623 thousand. Changes in the consolidated shareholders' equity during the period, excluding the result achieved, are mainly explained by the distribution of ordinary and extraordinary dividends approved by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 23rd April 2019. In ordinary session, the Shareholders' Meeting resolved to distribute an ordinary dividend of Euro 0.125 per share and an extraordinary dividend of Euro 0.2133 for each of the 222,178,966 outstanding shares. This extraordinary dividend was paid together with the ordinary one on 8th May 2019, with ex-dividend date on 6th May 2019 and record date on 7th May 2019. The total disbursement amounted to Euro 75,163 thousand. At the end of the year the company held treasury shares for a total value of Euro 26,774 thousand, up Euro 9,793 thousand compared to 31st December 2018. In fact, during the year, specifically since 1st April, Ascopiave S.p.A., has purchased treasury shares on the electronic share market for a value of Euro 22,376 thousand. During the first week of July 2019, 7,149,505 treasury shares were transferred to the company Anita S.r.l. as part of the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A., the finalisation of which was communicated to the market on 25th June 2019. As of 31st December 2019, Ascopiave S.p.A. held, subsequent to the purchases made during the period and the transfer of treasury shares to Anita S.r.l., 10,456,025 shares, equal to 4.4605% of the share capital, for the value indicated above. The hedge accounting reserve recorded at the end of 2018 was fully related to the sale of natural gas and consequently the balance was entirely deconsolidated due to the partnership described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" herein. The hedge accounting reserve recorded at the end of the period represents the current value of the derivative financial instruments signed by Ascopiave S.p.A. in order to hedge against any interest rate fluctuations. Such reserve, as at 31st December 2019, shows a negative balance of Euro 98 thousand. At the reporting date, no effects were recorded in the income statement.

Reserves for risks and charges decreased from Euro 3,901 thousand in 2018 to Euro 1,344 thousand in the period in question, thus recording a decrease of Euro 2,557 thousand. The deconsolidation of the sales companies and Sinergie italiane S.r.l. in liquidation determined a decrease in the item of Euro 2,825 thousand; whereas the extension of the consolidation scope led to an increase in the item of Euro 76 thousand. Net of the changes described, the item increased by Euro 192 thousand, mainly explained by the recognition of costs accrued in the period in question for long-term incentive plans. These amounts refer to the portion accrued in the year and relate to the 2018-2020 three-year period, as set out in the plans for the accrual of the bonus.

The changes in the period under examination are shown in the following table:

17. Severance indemnity
Severance indemnity increases from Euro 4,807 thousand as of 1st January 2019 to Euro 4,931 thousand as of 31st December 2019, with an increase of Euro 124 thousand. The change is mainly due to the deconsolidation of the sales companies which resulted in a decrease in the item of Euro 1,965 thousand, more than offset by the extension of the
____________________________________________________________________________________________

scope of consolidation which led to the recognition of the severance indemnity of the employees of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. on the date of the merger through acquisition (Euro +801 thousand) and the severance indemnity of the employees of AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l. (Euro +1,285 thousand). The following table shows the changes in the item in the period considered:

(Thousands of Euro)

* including the interest cost booked in the income statement.

4,807 2,086 (1,153) 1,085 (1,965)
71 4,931

The liability for employee severance indemnities are measured using an actuarial method, its value is therefore sensitive to changes in assumptions. The main assumptions used in the measurement of severance indemnities are the discount rate, the annual average percentage of outgoing employees and the maximum retirement age of employees. The discount rate used for the measurement of the liability resulting from employee severance indemnity is determined regarding the market yields of high quality fixed-income securities for which the due dates and amounts correspond to the due dates and amounts of future payments envisaged. For this plan, the average discount rate that reflects the estimated due dates and amounts of future payments relating to the 2019 plan is 0.79% (1.57% as of 31st December 2018). The other main assumptions of the model are: - mortality rate: survival table IPS55 - invalidity rate: INPS tables year 2000 - personnel turnover rate: 3.00% - increase in remuneration rate: 1.50% - inflation rate: 0.80% - anticipation rate: 2.00% The sensitivity analysis on the actuarial value of the provision did not highlight significant discrepancies compared to
the value accounted in the statement.
The cost of work activities has been included in the costs of personnel, while the interest cost, equal to Euro 54 thousand, is booked in "Other financial costs".

- the loan taken out with Intesa SanPaolo, disbursed in November 2019 for a total amount of Euro 50,000 thousand, equal to the residual debt as of 31st December 2019, with the entry of Euro 10,000 thousand in due to banks and short-term loans; the loan requires compliance with certain financial covenants to be verified annually on the Group's consolidated data prepared in accordance with the IFRS.
- the loan taken out with Crédit Agricole Friuladria, disbursed in October 2019 for an amount of Euro 30,000 thousand, equal to the residual debt as of 31st December 2019, with the recognition of Euro 6,000 thousand in due to banks and short-term loans; the loan requires compliance with certain financial covenants to be verified each year and every six months on the Group's consolidated data prepared in accordance with the IFRS.
- Concerning the loan issued by the European Investment Bank, paid in two tranches in 2013 equalling Euro 45,000 thousand, its outstanding debt as of 31st December 2019 is Euro 21,500 thousand, with the recognition of Euro 4,750 thousand in due to banks and short-term loans; the contract envisages the fulfilment of certain financial covenants to be checked twice a year on the Group's consolidated data prepared in compliance with the IFRS.

24,152 24,553

31.12.2018 11,350 16,653 28,003

Other non-current liabilities decreased from Euro 28,003 thousand in the previous year to Euro 24,553 thousand in the period in question, with a decrease of Euro 3,450 thousand. The deconsolidation of the gas and electricity sales companies, described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019", determined a decrease in the item of Euro 10,792 thousand mainly due to the security deposits of gas and electricity users. The extension of the scope of consolidation, on the other hand, led to an increase in the item of Euro 5,042 thousand, mainly attributable to longterm deferred income. Net of the changes described, considering the same consolidation scope, the item increased by Euro 2,300 thousand due to the performance of long-term deferred income. Long-term deferred income was recognised against revenues for contributions received from private and public entities for the construction of the distribution network or connections to the gas network and related to the useful life of the gas distribution plants. The suspension of revenues is explained by the content of Law no. 9/2014 which envisages the full deduction of contributions from private individuals from the value of technical assets held under concession within the scope of gas distribution. Security deposits recorded at the year refer to deposits received from the natural gas sales companies that work in the area where the gas distribution network managed by the Group companies is located, for the transport of the raw material.

20. Non-current financial liabilities The following table shows how the item is broken down at the end of each period considered:

31.12.2018 0 0

On 1st January 2019, the Group applied IFRS 16 for the first time. The first adoption of the standard, with the "modified retrospective approach" method, led to the recognition of non-current financial liabilities equal to Euro 694 thousand. The decrease recorded at 31st December 2019 is explained by the short-term reclassification of the principal amount that will be repaid within the next twelve months.

31.12.2019 22,021 22,021

31.12.2018 14,534 14,534

Payables for deferred taxation increase from Euro 14,534 thousand in the previous year to Euro 22,021 thousand, with an increase of Euro 7,487 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation due to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. and the effects of the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 with the Hera Group which involved the deconsolidation of the sales companies and the consolidation of AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l.. The deconsolidation of the sales companies determined a decrease in the item of Euro 1,503 thousand, mainly explained by the amortisation of customer lists. The extension of the scope of consolidation, related to the entry of the deferred tax payables of AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l., determined on the other hand an increase in the item for a total of Euro 9,485 thousand. For further information, please see the chapter "Business combinations" of this annual financial report. Net of the change described, deferred tax payables decreased by Euro 905 thousand and mainly include the tax effects deriving from the dynamics of amortisation of gas distribution networks. In calculating the taxes, reference was made to the IRES rate and, where applicable, to the IRAP rate in force, in relation to the tax period which includes the date of 31st December 2019 and at the time when it is estimated that any temporary differences will be carried forward.

(Thousands of Euro) Payables to suppliers Payables to suppliers for invoices not yet received Trade payables

31.12.2019 3,046
49,036 52,082

31.12.2018 70,956 60,229
131,185

Trade payables decrease from Euro 131,185 thousand in the previous year to Euro 52,082 thousand in the period in question, marking a decrease of Euro 79,127 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the deconsolidation of the gas and electricity sales companies, described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019", which resulted in a decrease in the item of Euro 97,971 thousand. These amounts were mainly related to the purchase and transportation of the raw materials gas and electricity. The extension of the scope of consolidation, on the other hand, led to the recognition of trade payables totalling Euro 2,979 thousand. Net of the effects described, trade payables increased by Euro 15,865 thousand, mainly due to the energy efficiency targets. The item mainly includes the payables to suppliers of materials and services for the extension or maintenance of the natural gas distribution network as well as for consultancy services received during the period in question. The item also includes the payables connected with the purchase of the energy efficiency certificates needed to achieve the energy saving objectives that the Group distribution companies must fulfil. These are calculated by evaluating the amounts of certificates accrued as compared to the 2019 target (regulatory period June 2019 - May 2020). The unit cost of certificates not purchased at the reporting date is the fair value of the prices recorded in the relevant market, calculated on 31st December 2019, and amounting to Euro 260 (Euro 260 on 31st December 2018).

24. Payables to tax authorities The following table shows how the item is broken down at the end of each period considered:

31.12.2019 82

31.12.2018 169 38 207

Tax payables increase from Euro 207 thousand in the previous year to Euro 4,728 thousand in the period in question, marking an increase of Euro 4,521 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of payables accrued towards the tax authorities for IRES and IRAP, after deducting the advances paid, accrued during the year. In fact, in 2019 the national tax consolidation agreement in force as of 31st December 2018 with Asco Holding S.p.A. expired due to the lack of some necessary requirements. During the year, the Group companies joined the national tax agreement with the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A..
The deconsolidation of the sales companies determined a decrease in the item of Euro 143 thousand, whereas the extension of the scope of consolidation led to the recognition of payables for Euro 92 thousand.

Other current liabilities decreased from Euro 27,539 thousand in 2018 to Euro 25,549 thousand in the period in question, marking a decrease of Euro 1,989 thousand. The change is partly explained by the deconsolidation of the sales companies, due to the operation described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" herein, which determined a decrease in the item of Euro 12,245 thousand mainly involving VAT payables. This decrease was partially offset by the extension of the scope of consolidation which, on the other hand, led to the recognition of other current liabilities totalling Euro 3,833 thousand. Consequently, net of the changes described, the item showed a decrease of Euro 6,069 thousand attributable to other payables.

Advances from clients Advances from clients represent the amounts paid by the customers as a contribution for works of allotments and connection and realisation of thermal plants in progress as of 31st December 2019.

Tax consolidation payables At the reporting date, the national tax consolidation agreement with Asco Holding S.p.A. ceased due to the lack of some necessary requirements: specifically, the Company has changed the financial year whose reporting date does not coincide with 31st December.The payables recorded refer to previous positions.

Welfare payables Welfare payables include the payables for the welfare obligations to pension institutions for company employees and directors, accrued as of 31st December 2019 but not yet paid as of year-end.

Payables to personnel The amounts due to employees include holidays not taken, deferred remuneration and bonuses earned as of 31st December 2019 but not paid out on that date and the relevant social security contributions. The item increased by Euro 1,182 thousand, from Euro 5,026 thousand in 2018 to Euro 6,207 thousand in the period in question. The change is mainly explained by the registration of the variable remuneration accrued for the completion of the partnership with the Hera Group for Euro 2,277 thousand. The change was partially offset by lower payables accrued at the end of the year.

VAT payables Payables to the tax authorities for VAT at the end of the period amount to Euro 495 thousand. The significant decrease recorded as against the previous year is explained by the deconsolidation of the sales companies which were involved in the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|157 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Annual deferred income Other deferred income is mainly attributable to the grants received for the construction of the natural gas distribution network and the relevant connections.

Annual accrued liabilities Accrued liabilities refer mainly to State fees and the fees granted to local licensing bodies for the extension of the concession for the distribution of natural gas, awaiting the territorial calls for tenders.

UTF payables and Additional Regional/Provincial Tax At the end of the year, no values were entered in the item since the payables recorded as of 31st December 2018 were entirely related to sales companies which were deconsolidated due to the partnership finalised on 19th December
2019. Consequently, the balance of these items is zero.

Liabilities for forward sales At the end of the year, no values were entered in the item because the payables recorded as of 31st December 2018 were entirely related to the sales companies which were deconsolidated due to the partnership finalised on 19th
December 2019. Consequently, the balance of these items is zero.

Other payables Considering the same consolidation scope, at the end of the year, the item showed a balance equal to Euro 10,297 thousand, recording an increase compared to the previous year of Euro 743 thousand. The increase is mainly related to higher payables to Cassa per i Servizi Energetici e Ambientali concerning the tariff components of natural gas transport. The item also includes payables for personnel charges accrued as of 31st December 2019.

26. Current financial liabilities The following table shows how the item is broken down for each period considered:

Current financial liabilities increase from Euro 115 thousand in 2018 to Euro 17,165 thousand in the period in question, marking an increase of Euro 17,041 thousand. The deconsolidation of the sales companies involved in the partnership finalised on 19th December 2019 determined an increase in the item of Euro 16,979 thousand. The intercompany current accounts with the divested companies, on which the Group's cash pooling was based, were in fact eliminated at the end of the previous year. These positions were closed during the first quarter of the current year. As mentioned in the paragraph "Non-current financial liabilities" herein, on 1st January 2019, the financial payables related to operating leases were recognised for the first time upon the first application of IFRS 16. The first adoption of the standard led to the recognition of Euro 297 thousand of higher payables. At the end of the year, the item did not show significant changes as the principal repayments made during the period were offset by the reclassification of the portions that will be paid within the next twelve months from the reporting date.

COMMENTS ON THE MAIN CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT ITEMS

115,347

At the end of the period considered, the Ascopiave Group's revenues amounted to Euro 124,911 thousand, an increase of Euro 9,564 thousand compared to the previous year (Euro 115,347 thousand). The increase is mainly explained by higher revenues from the transportation of natural gas on the Group's distribution network (Euro +6,430 thousand) and higher contributions recorded for the achievement of energy saving targets (Euro +3,923 thousand), partially offset by the lower revenues from services rendered as distributors (Euro -1,102 thousand), and lower other revenues (Euro -806 thousand). Revenues are substantially entirely generated in Italy. The transportation of natural gas on the distribution network generated revenues for Euro 80,370 thousand marking an increase of Euro 6,430 thousand compared to the same period in the previous year. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of the Restriction on total revenues related to the facilities managed by Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. subsequent to the merger through acquisition effective 1st July 2019. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in the line-by-line consolidation of the results achieved commencing that date; such revenues were previously recorded in financial income and charges under the item "profit/loss of companies measured with the equity method". The Restriction on total revenues is determined, year after year, based on the number of redelivery points the Company served during the reference period, as well as on the reference price, whose values are established and published by ARERA. The item "revenues from gas transport" includes a positive equalisation amount of Euro 711 thousand, a decrease as compared to the previous year of Euro 448 thousand. The equalisation amount varies according to the seasonality and the temperature trend as it results from the difference between the revenues charged to the sales companies for the natural gas transport service (contracts due to lower consumption) and the Restriction on Total Revenues recognised in the period in question. The revenues derived from services provided by distributors, being equal to Euro 3,849 thousand, show a decrease as compared to the previous year of Euro 1,102 thousand. The decrease is partly explained by contributions amounting to Euro 778 thousand registered in 2018 and related to the construction of the distribution network in parcelling. Revenues for services provided to Group companies show an increase of Euro 979 thousand compared to the previous year, and amount to Euro 8,469 thousand as of 31st December 2019. The contributions made by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment, at the end of the period considered, amount to Euro 29,176 thousand, up Euro 3,923 thousand compared to the previous year. The contributions are paid for the achievement of objectives set by the Authority itself in terms of energy saving and published by resolution, which defines the specific obligations of primary energy savings by the distributors to which such obligations apply. The contributions recognised as of 31st December 2019 are calculated by evaluating the quantities of energy efficiency certificates accrued as compared to the 2019 target (regulatory period June 2019 - May 2020). The unit contribution used for the economic quantification of the fulfilment of the obligation is equal to the final contribution communicated by GSE for the 2019 target (regulatory period June 2018 - May 2019) for the

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|160 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

certificates delivered, and equal to the fair value of the forecast contribution for the contributions being accrued and, as of 31st December 2019, equal to Euro 250 (Euro 250 as of 31st December 2018; source STX). The item "Other revenues" decreased from Euro 3,424 thousand in 2018, to Euro 2,618 thousand in the period in question, a decrease of Euro 806 thousand.

30. Cost of other raw materials The following table shows the costs relating to the purchase of other raw materials during the relevant financial periods:

At the end of the period considered, the costs incurred for the purchase of other raw materials are equal to Euro 1,358 thousand, marking an increase of Euro 88 thousand compared to the previous year. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of the costs incurred upon conducting the activities in the facilities managed by Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. subsequent to the merger through acquisition effective 1st July 2019. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in the line-by-line consolidation of the results achieved commencing that date; the costs were previously recorded in financial income and charges under the item "profit/loss of companies measured with the equity method". This item mainly includes costs related to the purchase of materials for the maintenance of the natural gas distribution infrastructure and odorization.

31. Costs for services Costs for services for the relevant periods are analysed in the following table:

(Thousands of Euro) Costs for counting meters reading Costs for mailing bills M ailing and telegraph costs M aintenance and repairs Consulting services Commercial services and advertisement Sundry suppliers Directors' and Statutory Auditors' fees Insu ran c e s Personnel costs Other managing expenses Costs for use of third-party assets Costs for services

The costs for services incurred during the financial year increase by Euro 2,966 thousand compared to the previous year, from Euro 28,766 thousand in 2018 to Euro 31,732 thousand in the period in question, mainly explained by the

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|161 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

higher costs incurred for use of third-party assets and other operating costs. The costs incurred for metre reading, amounting to Euro 776 thousand, are substantially in line with 2018 (Euro 775 thousand as of 31st December 2018). The costs for maintenance and repairs decrease from Euro 2,537 thousand in 2018, to Euro 2,533 thousand in the period in question, a minor change. The item mainly includes costs related to software fees and expenses incurred for routine facility maintenance. At the end of the year, the costs incurred for consultancy amounted to Euro 3,323 thousand, a decrease of Euro 305 thousand, mainly explained by a lower amount of IT consultancies required. Please note that the costs incurred for consultancy received for the finalisation of the partnership with the Hera Group, described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" of this annual financial report, are reclassified in the item "Result of discontinued operations" in compliance with the accounting standard IFRS 5. The item "Remuneration of directors and auditors" increased by Euro 338 thousand compared to the previous year, totalling Euro 1,244 thousand. Other operating costs increased by Euro 472 thousand, amounting to Euro 1,669 thousand. The increase is mainly explained by the higher bank charges incurred which led to an increase of Euro 352 thousand. The item costs for use of third-party assets mainly includes the fees paid to the Local Authorities for the management of natural gas distribution concessions and recorded an increase of Euro 2,039 thousand compared to the previous year. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of fees accrued as concerns the facilities managed by Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. subsequent to the merger through acquisition effective 1st July 2019. The extension of the scope of consolidation resulted in the line-by-line consolidation of the results achieved commencing that date; the costs were previously recorded in financial income and charges under the item "profit/loss of companies measured with the equity method". The increase recorded was partly offset by the effects of the first application of IFRS 16. The methods for recognising operating leases led to the entry of lower costs for the use of third-party assets totalling Euro 142 thousand, such as lower fees recorded for rentals of branch offices, company vehicles and printers.
32. Costs for staff The following table shows the breakdown of personnel costs in the years considered:

The cost for staff is net of costs capitalised by the companies of natural gas distribution as against increases in intangible assets for works performed on a time and material basis, which are directly attributed to the implementation of facilities for the distribution of natural gas and recorded as an asset. Costs for staff decrease from Euro 23,555 thousand in 2018, to Euro 21,632 thousand in the period in question, showing a decrease of Euro 1,923 thousand. The change is mainly explained by the non-recurring items recorded in 2018 in relation to the fees paid to the Group's General Manager and Chief Financial Officer for the termination of the employment relationship notified during the third quarter of the financial year. The agreements signed with them led to the recognition of higher costs totalling Euro 2,411 thousand. Net of the effect described, personnel costs increased by Euro 488 thousand, mainly due to the extension of the consolidation scope subsequent to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. which took place on 1st July 2019. At the end of the year, costs for longterm incentive plans were recognised totalling Euro 472 thousand, up Euro 223 thousand compared to the previous year.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|162 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

In accordance with IFRS 2, the cost of the long-term incentive plans had an offsetting item in the shareholders' equity reserves for Euro 60 thousand for the portion to be paid in shares and in the retirement funds for Euro 412 thousand for the cash portion. The amounts recorded for long-term incentive plans refer to the first year of the 2018-2020 period, as set out in the plans for the accrual of the bonus. Capitalised personnel cost registered a decrease of Euro 299 thousand, from Euro 7,430 thousand in the previous period, to Euro 7,132 thousand in the period in question. Personnel costs consequently decreased by Euro 1,625 thousand.

Other operating costs, increasing from Euro 27,548 in 2018 to Euro 33,902 thousand in the period in question, show an increase of Euro 6,354 thousand; this change is mainly due to higher costs incurred for the purchase of Energy efficiency certificates (Euro +7,966 thousand). The costs recognised as of 31st December 2019 for the purchase of energy efficiency certificates are calculated by evaluating the amounts of certificates accrued as compared to the 2018 target (regulatory period June 2019 - May 2020). The unit cost for certificates not purchased at the reporting date is the fair value of the prices recorded in the relevant market, calculated on 31st December 2019, and amounting to Euro 260 (Euro 260 on 31st December 2018). The increase is partly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation subsequent to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. effective 1st July 2019, which resulted in the recognition of costs related to the objectives applicable to such company. The increase in the costs booked for efficiency and energy saving objectives was only partially offset by lower contingent liabilities recognised during the period under examination. In 2018, Euro 821 thousand were recorded due to the alignment of non-current deferred income with the amount of contributions deducted from the assets.

At the end of the period considered, the item "other operating income" shows an increase of Euro 1,125 thousand, from Euro 355 thousand as of 31st December 2018, to Euro 1,479 thousand in the period in question. The change is mainly explained by the recognition of the surplus value connected with the settlement agreement signed with the municipality of Costabissara, described in the paragraph "Non-current financial assets" herein, and concerning the value of the sale of the distribution facilities on 1st October 2011.

The increase is partly explained by the extension of the scope of consolidation subsequent to the merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. effective 1st July 2019, which resulted in the recognition of amortisation and depreciation related to the assets previously managed by the company. The recognition method of operating leases led to the entry of higher amortisation and depreciation costs totalling Euro 275 thousand for the rental of peripheral headquarters and company cars.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|164 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

increase as compared to the previous year of Euro 104 thousand. The increase is mainly explained by the higher interest paid on bank loans, up Euro 47 thousand. Subsequent to the first application of IFRS 16, the payment of operating lease fees determines the decrease in current financial liabilities for lease payables for the principal amount and the entry of financial charges. At the end of the year, this led to the recognition of Euro 16 thousand. The item "Result quota from jointly controlled companies" includes the net results achieved by the jointly controlled companies in the reference period; they decreased slightly and amount to Euro 648 thousand. This result corresponds to the profit achieved by Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. as of 30th June 2019 and is unchanged with respect to the result consolidated upon preparing the Consolidated half-year financial statements. On 1st July 2019, the merger through acquisition approved by the shareholders of the companies took effect. The items that made up this net change are consequently fully recorded in the Group's consolidated financial statements effective that date.

increase of Euro 446,965 thousand compared to the previous year. The change is mainly explained by the effects of the partnership with the Hera Group described in the paragraph "Significant events during FY 2019" of this report. Pursuant to IFRS 5, the net result of discontinued operations shown for comparative purposes includes the results achieved during 2018 by the gas and electricity sales companies involved in the partnership.

The item includes the gross capital gain generated by the sale of the investments in the companies involved in the partnership, and the costs incurred for the completion of the transaction, accompanied by the related tax effect. This effect was further influenced by the results achieved by the sales companies during the period in question, up to the date on which their control was transferred, and by the dividends that they distributed to the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A. in May 2019.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. into Ascopiave S.p.A. and simultaneous transfer of the gas distribution business to the fully controlled subsidiary Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. As of 31st December 2018, Ascopiave S.p.A. held 48.86% of the share capital of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., a jointly controlled entity. The remainder, 51.14%, was held by Anita S.r.l.. On 25th June 2019, the deed of merger through acquisition of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. was signed, with the simultaneous transfer of the assets and liabilities of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. to Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A. thus allowing the acquisition of the management of the entire gas distribution business of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l.. The operation took effect on 1st July 2019, when the treasury shares of Ascopiave S.p.A. were transferred to the former shareholders of Unigas Distribuzione Gas S.r.l.. In exchange for the merged assets and liabilities of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., the former shareholder of the company (Anita S.r.l.) was assigned 7,149,505 Ascopiave S.p.A.'s treasury shares, for an equivalent value of Euro 26,975 thousand leading to, together with the fees previously paid for the acquisition of 48.86% of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. amounting to Euro 20,652, a total payment of Euro 47,627 thousand for the total acquisition of the gas distribution unit of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l.. The evaluation of an independent expert confirmed the fair value of the merged assets and led to the recognition of a merger deficit of Euro 9,367 thousand. At the same time as the merger through acquisition, the business unit of Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l. was transferred to Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.r.l. for a value of Euro 42,773 thousand with financial settlement of the different value transferred with respect to the fair value. The costs of the acquisition pursuant to "IFRS 3 Revised - Business combinations" were recognised in the consolidated income statement for a value of Euro 300 thousand. The stake acquired was assessed by an external independent party in order to determine the allocation of the higher value paid with respect to the carrying amounts of the shareholders' equity at 30th June 2019. The business combination was provisionally recognised as of 31st December 2019 in accordance with the international accounting standard IFRS 3.62.

Risk and uncertainty factors
Information on agreements not disclosed in the balance sheet Pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, point 22-ter, Italian Civil Code, introduced by Legislative Decree 173 on 23rd November 2008, we announce that the company has not entered into agreements not disclosed in the balance sheet.
Management of financial risk: objectives and criteria The investments in the operative activities of the Group mainly consist of short-term and medium/long-term bank loans, financial leasing, lease contracts with the possibility of purchase and short-term bank deposits at sight. The recourse to such forms of investment exposes the Group to the risk connected with the fluctuation of interest tax rate, that successively determine possible variations on financial costs. Operations put the Group on the position of possible receivable risks with the counterparties.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
|171 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The Group, furthermore, is subject to liquidity risks because the available financial resources may not be sufficient to meet its financial obligations, in the terms and deadlines forecast. The Board of Directors re-examines and agrees the policies for risk management, described hereinafter.

Interest rate risks The Group manages its liquidity needs both through temporary credit lines and short-term loans at variable rates which, due to their continuous fluctuation, do not make it easy to hedge against interest rate risk, and through medium/long-term loans with fixed and variable rates. The medium-long term loans managed by the Group, with variable and fixed rates, have a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 165,111 thousand and expiration dates between 1st January 2020 and 28th February 2030. Medium and long term loans at variable rate envisage reimbursement between 2020 and 2025, with residual balance as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 81,500 thousand (Euro 26,250 thousand as of 31st December 2018), represented by:
- Loan with the European Investment Bank disbursed in August 2013 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 21,500 thousand,
- Loan with BNL disbursed in August 2019 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 30,000 thousand, the latter hedged by a financial derivative with effect from February 2020, for which the interest rate risk is therefore neutralised,
- Loan with Crédit Agricole - Friuladria granted in October 2019 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 30,000 thousand; the latter is hedged by a financial derivative instrument, and therefore its interest rate risk is neutralised.
As of 31st December 2019, the derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates, relating to the loans taken out with BNL and Crédit Agricole - Friuladria, detailed in paragraph no. 27 "Current liabilities on derivative financial instruments" and whose mark to market amounts to Euro 98 thousand in total, are effective. The following loans are not exposed to interest rate risks, as they envisage the application of a fixed rate:
- the loan taken out with BNL in August 2017, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 25,000 thousand,
- the loan signed with Cassa Centrale Banca at the beginning of 2018, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 8,611 thousand,
- the loan taken out with Intesa SanPaolo in November 2019, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 50,000 thousand.

The loans above are subjected to covenants.

Please refer to Paragraph no. 18 "Medium and Long Term Loans" for additional details.

Sensitivity analysis of the interest rate risk The following table shows the impacts on the Group's Pre-tax result of the possible variations in interest rates in a reasonably possible interval.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
|172 Ascopiave Group ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The sensitivity analysis, obtained by simulating a variation on interest tax rates applied on the credit lines of the Group equal to 50 basis points in decrease (with a minimum limit of zero basis points) and 200 basis points in increase, maintaining unchanged all the other variables, leads to an estimation of an effect on the result before taxes which is negative for Euro 3,574 thousand or positive for Euro 892 thousand. Receivable risk Because of the sale of the equity investments in the gas and electricity sales business, the Group's operating activity is no longer exposed to credit risks caused by the failure to fulfil commercial obligations with counterparties. The Group provides its business services to a limited number of players in the gas sector; if compensation for such services is not received or overdue, this could negatively affect the economic results and the financial balance, but credit protection is supported by the application of the guarantee mechanisms set forth in the Network Code.
Liquidity risk The liquidity risk consists in the lack of available and sufficient financial resources in order to meet the Group's financial obligations, in the forecast terms and deadlines, due to the impossibility of raising new funds or selling assets on the market, affecting the income statement if the Group is obliged to incur additional costs to meet its obligations, or in case of insolvency entailing risks for the business. The Group constantly aims at highest balance and flexibility of financing sources and uses, minimising that risk. The two main factors influencing Group liquidity are on the one hand the resources generated or absorbed by the operative or investment assets, on the other hand the debt expiry characteristics and renewal.
Specific risks in the business sectors in which the Group operates Regulations The activities carried out by the Ascopiave Group in the gas sector are subject to regulations. Directives and regulatory measures adopted in the European Union and by the Italian Government, as well as the resolutions of the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment can have a significant impact on the operations, the operating results and the financial balance. Future changes in the regulatory policy adopted by the European Union or at a national level could have unexpected effects on the regulatory reference framework and, consequently, on the activity and results of the Group.

The debt/net equity ratio as of 31st December 2019 is 0.24, an improvement as compared to 31st December 2019, when it amounted to 0.26. The trend of this indicator is related to the combined effect of the change in the Net financial position, which worsened by Euro 95,093 thousand in 2019, and the Shareholders' equity, which significantly increased by Euro 425,623 thousand. These changes are explained, in addition to the normal flow of the year, also by the accounting effects resulting from the agreement signed with the Hera Group.

Business segment reporting
The sector information is provided with reference to the business sectors in which the Group operates. Business sectors are identified as primary segments of activities. The criteria used for identifying the activity segments have been inspired by the methods whereby management runs the Group and assigns managerial responsibilities. Based on the information required by the IFRS 8 "Business Segment Reporting, Operative segments", the company has identified as segments to be reported the activities of gas distribution and other. Specifically, the segment "Other" includes the cogeneration and heat supply activity and the parent company. Information for geographic sectors is not provided, since the Group does not have any business activity outside of the national territory. The following tables show the information on revenues concerning the business segments of the Group for 2019.

Earnings per share
As required by the IAS 33 accounting standard, the following information is provided about the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the number of shares, net of own shares. For the purposes of calculating the profit per base share, the numbering used the financial result of the period less the share attributable to third parties. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profit per share is equal to that per share in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect. The result and the number of ordinary shares used to calculate base earning per share, identified according to the method set out in IAS 33 are reported below:

Furthermore:

-

the economic relations between the companies of the Group and the subsidiary companies occur at market

prices and are eliminated in the process of consolidation;

-

the operations set up by the companies of the Group with related parties are part of normal management

activity and are regulated at market prices;

-

with reference to the provisions of art. 150, paragraph 1 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 58 of 24th February

1998, no operations have been carried out that could potentially represent a conflict of interest with

companies of the Group, by members of the Board of Directors.

On 24th November 2010, the Board of Directors approved a procedure for operations with related parties (the

"Procedure"). Said Procedure disciplines the operations with related parties by the Company, directly or by proxy of

subsidiary companies, as set forth by Art. 2391-bis of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to the National Commission for

Publicly Traded Companies (CONSOB) Decision no. 17221 dated 12th March 2010 and subsequent modifications.

The Procedure was implemented on 1st January 2011 and took the place of the previous regulation regarding the issue

of operation with related parties, approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on 11th September 2006 (and

following modifications).

For the contents of the Procedure, please refer to the document, available online on the Company website at the

following URL: http://www.gruppoascopiave.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Procedura-per-le-operazioni-con-parti-

correlate-GruppoAscopiave-20101124.pdf.

In order to implement correctly the Procedure, a periodic map of all the so-called Related Parties is drafted, to

delimit and apply to them the control provisions and the contents of the document. Company Directors are required

to declare, when applicable, possible conflicts of interest in the performance of the afore-mentioned transactions.

Significant events subsequent to the end of 2019
Publication of information document On 1st January 2020, Ascopiave S.p.A. announced that the information document prepared pursuant to Article 71, Consob Regulation no. 11971/99, relating to the partnership between Ascopiave S.p.A. and the Hera Group, whose completion was communicated to the stock market on 19th December 2019, is available to the public at the premises of Borsa Italiana S.p.A., at the registered office of the Company, its website www.gruppoascopiave.it, and also on the authorised storage mechanism "eMarket Storage" (www.emarketstorage.com) managed by Spafid Connect S.p.A..
Ascopiave, territorial investments on the rise: over Euro 40 million envisaged in 2020 On 16th January 2020, Ascopiave S.p.A. announced that Ascopiave's Investment Plan, for the expansion and upgrade of its distribution network and enhancement of energy efficiency, underscores the sturdy connection between the Group and its catchment area. In 2020, the economic commitment of the Group ­ listed under the Star segment of Borsa Italiana, among the leading operators in the natural gas sector in the country ­ will be over Euro 40 million, against Euro 31 million in 2019. Disbursements will focus on the creation of new distribution infrastructure, extraordinary maintenance works and new allotments, in addition to the installation of smart metres, designed to help customers save by making their homes as energy sustainable as possible. In the year just ended, the gas distribution works performed by the Ascopiave Group in Municipalities where it holds assignments involved 93 km of network, up +25% compared to 2018. Of these, over 52 km were in the Province of Treviso alone, where the subsidiary AP Reti Gas performed the works. Again as regards this Province alone, investments already implemented or planned over the 2019­2021 three-year period concern 120 km of network, worth about Euro 16 million. The works include those in progress in Nervesa della Battaglia for approximately Euro 2.3 million, Castelfranco Veneto (about Euro 2 million), Fontanelle (approximately Euro 1.5 million), San Biagio di Callalta (approximately Euro 1.5 million) and Pederobba (little over Euro 1 million), as well as those planned in 18 Municipalities in the Marca Trevigiana Area.
Guidelines of Ascopiave S.p.A.'s Board of Directors for the Shareholders on the future composition of the Board of Directors On 24th January 2020, Ascopiave S.p.A. announced that the document "Guidelines of Ascopiave S.p.A.'s Board of Directors for the Shareholders on the future composition of the Board of Directors" is available on the website (www.gruppoascopiave.it "Investor Relations" ­ "Shareholders' Meetings") and on the website of the authorised storage mechanism "eMarket Storage" (www.emarketstorage.com) of Spafid Connect S.p.A..
Purchase of Hera S.p.A. shares Subsequent to the press release issued on 31st January 2020 by Hera S.p.A., informing that Ascopiave S.p.A. had acquired a 2.5% stake in Hera S.p.A., with a view to strengthening the partnership between the two companies, the Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A. has approved the purchase of Hera S.p.A. shares, corresponding to approximately 0.4% of its share capital. Ascopiave will inform the market when the purchase is completed.
Resignation of Mr Giorgio Martorelli from the Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A. On 3rd February 2020, Ascopiave S.p.A. informed that it received the resignation of Mr Giorgio Martorelli, an independent and non-executive member of the Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A., as well as a member of the Control and Risks Committee. The resignation was submitted for personal reasons. Mr Martorelli had been elected by the Shareholders' Meeting on 28th April 2017 and was presented as a candidate jointly by Amber Capital Italia SGR S.p.A., being him the manager of the Alpha Ucits Sicav-Amber Equity Fund, and by ASM Rovigo S.p.A., a company controlled by the Municipality of Rovigo, both minority shareholders of Ascopiave S.p.A.. To the knowledge of the Company, Mr Martorelli does not hold any shares in Ascopiave S.p.A.. Subsequent to the resignation, during the next meeting, the Board of Directors will take appropriate action under the law and the Articles of Association.

This investment is aligned with the strategic goals of the Group, since the activities and services managed by Acsm Agam S.p.A are consistent with the development lines pursued by the Ascopiave Group.
Disclosure on the purchase of treasury shares Ascopiave announces the purchase on the electronic share market, in compliance with the authorisation to purchase treasury shares resolved by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 23rd April 2019, in the period between 1st January 2020 and 13th March 2020 1,451,664 ordinary shares at the average unit price of Euro 4.268, for a total value of Euro 6,196,311.64.

Information on Covid 19 During the first months of 2020, the world has been progressively struck by the international health emergency caused by the Covid 19 virus, the so-called Coronavirus. The emergency has affected several countries and, as the days go by, it is spreading and striking many others. The Group has carefully and constantly monitored the evolution of the situation in the area where its activities are located, but also the development of the pandemic at an international level. In order to deal with the emergency, the Group is operating in absolute compliance with the decrees issued by the bodies in charge, both at national and local level. The Group's Management is assessing the potential impacts in terms of performance in order to be able to make any decisions aimed at mitigating any effects on the execution of the business.
Goals and policies of the Group
As for the natural gas distribution segment, the Group intends to enhance its portfolio of concessions, aiming at confirming its service provision in the territorial areas served, in which it boasts a significant presence, and at expanding its activities to other fields, with the goal of increasing its market share and strengthen its local leadership. As for the segment of gas sale, on 19th December 2019, the Group finalised the business partnership with the Hera Group through the creation of a primary entity in Northern-Eastern Italy boasting over one million energy customers, as well as, at the same time, a reorganisation of the respective gas distribution activities. With this operation, Ascopiave implements its strategic repositioning plan, by entering into an agreement in the sales area with a primary player and strengthening its presence in the core business of gas distribution. On 31st July 2019, the Boards of Directors of Hera S.p.A. and Ascopiave S.p.A. had approved the execution of the framework agreement that will initiate the business partnership through the joint venture EstEnergy. The operation was subject to the usual conditions envisaged for this type of transaction and to all communications and approvals from the competent authorities and bodies, as well as, as regards only the equity investments concerned, the non-exercise of the right of first refusal and the approval by the other shareholders, in the case of the equity investments held by Ascopiave S.p.A. in the joint ventures ASM Set S.r.l., Etra Energia S.r.l. and Sinergie Italiane S.r.l. in liquidation.

IAS/IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 31st DECEMBER 2019
Drafting criteria and compliance with IFRS
The Ascopiave S.p.A. Financial Statements as of 31st December 2019 have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS, that is all the "International Financial Reporting Standards", "International Accounting Standards" (IAS), all the interpretations of the "International Financial Reporting Committee" (IFRIC), previously "Standing Interpretations Committee" (SIC) adopted by the European Commission in accordance with the procedure set forth in EC Directive no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council on 19th July 2002 as well as with the provisions issued for the implementation of Art. 9 of Legislative Decree no. 38/2005. The annual financial report was prepared based on the principle of going concern and historical cost, considering the adjustments as appropriate, except for the budget items that under IFRS must be recognised at fair value as described in the evaluation criteria. The accounting principles used are consistent with the ones used for the Statement year ended 31st December 2018, except for the instances set forth in the Accounting Standards paragraph and amendments and interpretations applicable from 1st January 2019 onward. For comparative purposes, the data are presented with the income data of the Statement for the year ended 31st December 2018. The Auditing company PricewatherhouseCoopers S.p.A. performed the legal auditing of the Statement as the company in charge of accounting review for the main Group companies. This Statement is drafted in Euro, as the currency of the country where the company operates. It includes Balance Sheet, Comprehensive Income Statement, Statement of Changes in Equity and Cash Flow Statement and Explanatory Notes. All values stated in the tables and in explanatory notes are expressed as thousands of Euro, unless otherwise specified. This Statement as of 31st December 2019 was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on 13th March 2020.
Financial statements representation
The items of the balance sheet are classified into "current" and "non-current"; those in the comprehensive income statement are classified by their nature according to the multi-step format. The statement of changes in Shareholders' equity presents the opening and closing balances of each net equity item reconciling them through the profit or loss for the period, any operation with shareholders (if applicable) and other variations in the net equity. The Statement of cash flows has been defined according to the "indirect" method, by adjusting operating income of non-monetary components. We believe that these patterns adequately represent the operating results, financial position and cash flows.

IAS/IFRS accounting standards and related IFRIC interpretations approved and applicable to the financial statements of the years starting after 1st January 2019

Hereby is a brief description of amendments, improvements and interpretations applicable to financial reports as of 31st December 2019 and effective 1st January 2019. The standards, amendments and interpretations which by their nature cannot be adopted by the Company are excluded from the list.
IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments On 7th June 2017, the IASB issued interpretation IFRIC 23 ­ Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, which provides indications as to how to recognise, as far as income taxes are concerned, uncertainties over the tax treatment of a given event. IFRIC 23 is applicable from 1st January 2019. Early adoption is allowed, but the Company decided not to exercise this option.

IFRS 9 ­ Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation On 12th October 2017, the IASB published some amendments to IFRS 9 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, aimed at allowing the measurement of amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) of financial assets characterised by a prepayment option with the so-called "negative compensation". These changes will be effective from 1st January 2019. Early adoption is permitted (in conjunction with the date of first application of IFRS 9) but the Company decided not to exercise this option.

IFRS 16 ­ Leases IFRS 16 standard ­ Leases was approved on 31st October 2017, with significant impact on Statements of lessees: the distinction between financial leases and operating leases was eliminated, introducing a new single model for all leases which entails an asset entry for the right of use and a liability entry for the lease. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2019. Ascopiave S.p.A. has decided not to adopt the standard ahead of time (concomitantly with the date of first application of IFRS 15). On the basis of the transition provisions of IFRS 16, on 1st January 2019 the effects related to the cases existing on the same date have been recognised, without restating the previous comparative period (so-called "modified retrospective approach") and recognising the right-of-use asset for an amount equal to the respective financial liability.

The following table shows the impacts of the first adoption of the standard on the Company's equity data:

The discount rate used for the transition to the new standard is the Company's marginal cost of debt of as of 1st January 2019. The evaluation did not include, as allowed by the standard, short-term leases and low-value asset leases. For the Company, the effect of the application of the new standard has mainly concerned operating leases relating to tangible fixed assets such as buildings, vehicles and trucks, as well as computer equipment. The adoption of IFRS 16 determined, on 1st January 2019, the recognition of greater right-of-use fixed assets and an equal amount of financial payables for leases divided into current and non-current.
IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28) The amendment, issued by the IASB on 12th October 2017, concerns companies that finance associates and joint ventures with loans for which a short-term repayment is not expected. The amendment is applicable commencing 1st January 2019.
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle On 12th December 2017, the IASB issued the "Annual improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle" as part of the annual programme for improving the principles; most of the changes are clarifications or corrections to existing IFRSs, or amendments resulting from changes previously made to the IFRSs. These improvements will be effective from 1st January 2019.
IAS 19 ­ Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement On 7th February 2018, the IASB published the amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, specifying the methods according to which, in the event of changes to a defined benefit plan, the costs relating to pension benefits must be determined for the remaining relevant period. These changes will be effective from 1st January 2019.
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting On 29th March 2018, the IASB published the revised version of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting together with a document that updates the references to the previous Conceptual Framework contained in the IFRSs, providing:
- an updated definition of assets and liabilities; - a new chapter on the topics of measurement, derecognition and disclosure; - clarifications on some postulates for compiling the financial statements, such as the principle of prudence
and the substance over form concept. These changes will be effective from 1st January 2020.
IFRS 3 ­ Business Combinations On 22nd October 2018, the IASB published the amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, with the aim of identifying the criteria according to which a successful acquisition regards a business or a Company of assets that, as such, do not meet the definition of business set out in IFRS 3. These changes will be effective for the business combinations that will occur commencing 1st January 2020.

|10 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

IAS 1 and IAS 8 On 31st October 2018, the IASB published the amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, clarifying the definition of "material information", in order to establish whether to include a disclosure in the financial statements. These changes will be effective from 1st January 2020.
IFRS and IFRIC accounting standards, amendments and interpretations approved by the European Union, not yet mandatorily applicable and not adopted ahead of time as of 31st December 2019
On 31st October 2018, the IASB published the document "Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)". The document introduced a change in the definition of "relevant" contained in IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. This amendment has the aim of making the definition of "relevant" more specific and has introduced the concept of "obscured information" alongside the concepts of omitted or incorrect information already present in the two modified standards. The amendment clarifies that information is "obscured" if it has been described in such a manner as to produce a similar effect for the primary readers of the financial statements to that produced if such information had been omitted or was incorrect. The changes introduced were approved on 29th November 2019 and apply to all transactions subsequent to 1st January 2020.
On 29th March 2018, the IASB published an amendment to the "References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards". The amendment is effective for periods starting on 1st January 2020 or later, but early application is allowed. The Conceptual Framework defines the fundamental concepts for financial reporting and guides the Board in the development of IFRS standards. The document helps ensure that the standards are conceptually consistent and that similar transactions are treated the same way, in order to provide useful information to investors, lenders and other creditors. The Conceptual Framework supports companies in the development of accounting standards when no IFRS standard is applicable to a particular transaction and, more generally, helps the parties involved to understand and interpret the Standards.
The IASB, on 26th September 2019, published an amendment called "Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform", modifying IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as well as IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Specifically, the amendment modifies some of the requirements for the application of hedge accounting, envisaging temporary exceptions, in order to mitigate the impact deriving from the uncertainty of the IBOR reform (still in progress) on future cash flows in the period preceding its completion. The amendment also requires companies to provide additional information in the financial statements regarding their hedging relationships which are directly affected by the uncertainties generated by the reform and to which the aforementioned exceptions apply. The changes take effect from 1st January 2020, but companies can choose early application.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|11 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

IFRS accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet approved by the European Union
At the reporting date, the competent bodies of the European Union have not completed yet the approval process necessary for the adoption of the amendments and principles described below.
On 22nd October 2018, the IASB published the document "Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)". The document provides some clarifications regarding the definition of business for the purposes of the correct application of IFRS 3. Specifically, the amendment clarifies that while a business usually produces an output, the generation of an output is not strictly necessary to identify a business in the presence of an integrated set of activities/processes and assets. However, to meet the definition of business, an integrated set of activities/processes and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. To this end, the IASB has replaced the expression "ability to create outputs" with "ability to contribute to the creation of outputs" to clarify that a business can exist even without the presence of all the inputs and processes necessary to create an output. The amendment also introduces an optional "concentration test" which excludes the presence of a business if the price paid is substantially attributable to a single activity or set of activities. The changes apply to all business combinations and acquisitions of activities subsequent to 1st January 2020, but early application is permitted.
On 18th May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts which is intended to replace IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts. The objective of the new standard is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents the rights and obligations arising from the insurance contracts issued. The IASB has developed the standard to eliminate inconsistencies and weaknesses of existing accounting policies, providing a single principle-based framework to take into account all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts that an insurer holds. The new standard also envisages presentation and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between entities belonging to this sector. The new standard measures an insurance contract based on a General Model or a simplified version thereof, called Premium Allocation Approach ("PAA"). The main features of the General Model are:
- the estimates and assumptions of future cash flows are always the current ones; - the measurement reflects the time value of money; - the estimates envisage extensive use of information observable on the market; - there is a current and explicit risk measurement; - the expected profit is deferred and aggregated into groups of insurance contracts at the time of initial
recognition; and - the expected profit is recognised in the contractual coverage period taking into account the adjustments
deriving from changes in the assumptions relating to the cash flows connected to each group of contracts. The PAA approach involves measuring the liability for the residual coverage of a group of insurance contracts provided that, at the time of initial recognition, the entity envisages that this liability provides a reasonable approximation to the general model. Contracts with coverage period of one year or less are automatically eligible for the PAA approach. The simplifications deriving from the application of the PAA method do not apply to the assessment of
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|12 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

liabilities for existing claims, which are measured with the General Model. However, it is not necessary to discount those cash flows if the balance to be paid or collected is expected to take place within one year from the date on which the claim occurred. An entity shall apply the new standard to insurance contracts issued, including reinsurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held and also to investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF). The standard applies from 1st January 2021, but early application is permitted, only for entities that apply IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
On 11th September 2014, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture. The document was published in order to resolve the current conflict between IAS 28 and IFRS 10. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 28, the profit or loss resulting from the sale or transfer of a non-monetary asset to a joint venture or associate in exchange for a share in the capital of the latter is limited to the share held in the joint venture or associate by other investors outside the transaction. On the contrary, IFRS 10 envisages the recognition of the entire profit or loss in the event of loss of control of a subsidiary, even if the entity continues to hold a non-controlling stake in the same, including in this case also the sale or transfer of a subsidiary company to a joint venture or associate. The changes introduced envisage that in a sale/transfer of an asset or subsidiary to a joint venture or associate, the extent of the profit or loss to be recognised in the financial statements of the seller/transferor depends on whether the sold/transferred assets or subsidiaries constitute a business or not, as defined by IFRS 3. In the event that the assets or the subsidiary sold/transferred represent a business, the entity must recognise the profit or loss on the entire stake previously held whereas, otherwise, the share of profit or loss relating to the share still held by the entity must be eliminated. At the moment the IASB has suspended the application of this amendment.
Other accounting standards, amendments and interpretations applied from 1st January 2019
IFRS 2 ­ Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions On 20th June 2016, the IASB published a number of amendments to IFRS 2 - Classification and Measurement of Sharebased Payment Transactions. With these changes, the document resolves some issue related to the accounting on share based payments. Specifically, the amendments improve considerably the measurement of cash-settled sharebased payments, classification thereof and accounting for modification of a share-based payment from cash-settled to equity-settled.
IFRIC 22 ­ Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration On 8th December 2016, the IASB published IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration, defining the exchange rate to be used in foreign currencies transactions in case the payment is made or received in advance. The application of such interpretation had no impact on the Company's financial report as the Company does not transact in foreign currency. On the same date, the IASB issued the document "Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle" as part of the programme of annual improvements to the standards; most amendments are clarifications or corrections of existing IFRS, or amendments resulting from changes previously made to the IFRSs. The application of these amendments had no impact on the Company's financial reports.

|13 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

IAS 40 ­ Transfers of Investment Property On 8th December 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 40 - Transfers of Investment to govern transfer to/from investment property to other asset groups. Specifically, it is settled if a property under construction or development accounted in inventories may be reclassified in property investments if there was a change in its usage.

The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to provide accounting estimates based on complex and/or subjective assumptions, on experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable and realistic and that are known at the time of the estimate. The use of these estimates affects the values of the assets and liabilities reported on the financial statements as well as the amounts of costs and revenues and the information relating to potential assets and liabilities in the period considered. If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions, which are based on the Management's best assessment, differ from the actual circumstances, they shall be modified so as to be appropriate in the period in which the circumstances arise.
Estimates are used to report: - Impairment of non-financial assets: the Company assesses whether there are permanent reductions in the value
of all non-financial assets. In particular, goodwill is tested for possible reductions in value at least annually and during the year if such indicators exist; this requires an estimate of the use value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated, in turn based on the estimated cash flows expected from the unit and their discounting based on a suitable discount rate. - Provisions for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, useful lives of intangible fixed assets and their amortisation and depreciation. - Benefit plans for employees and share-based payment plans (so-called phantom stock option). - Taxes and provisions for risks and charges. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the variations are immediately reflected in the income statement. In applying the accounting principles, the directors have taken decisions based on the stated discretional evaluations, with a significant effect on the values reported on the statements. However, the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and estimates may determine results that, in the future, will need to be significantly adjusted at the book value of such assets and/or liabilities.
Measurement criteria
The accounting standards adopted by Ascopiave S.p.A. are reported below:
Other intangible fixed assets: intangible assets mainly include assets pertaining to patent and software rights. After the initial recognition, as they have a defined useful life, intangible assets are booked net of the accumulated relevant amortisation operations and net of any impairments, determined with the same basis indicated below for tangible assets. The useful life is then re-examined on an annual basis, and any changes, if necessary, made prospectively.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|14 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Any profits or losses deriving from the sale of an intangible asset are determined as the difference between the disposal value and the book value of the asset, and are reported in the income statement at the time of the sale.
Tangible fixed assets: tangible assets are booked at purchase cost, including ancillary costs directly ascribable to the putting into operation of the asset for the use for which it was acquired. Lands - both free of constructions and annexed to civil and industrial buildings - are booked separately and are not depreciated since they are elements with an unlimited useful life. Maintenance and repair costs which do not increase the value and/or extend the residual useful life of the assets are entered in the year in which they are incurred. Otherwise, they are capitalised. Tangible assets are presented net of the relevant accumulated depreciation, and any impairments determined according to the basis described below. Depreciation is calculated in uniform instalments based on the estimated useful life of the asset for the company, which is re-examined annually, and any changes, if necessary, are made prospectively.
The main economical-technical rates used are as follows:

Buildings Equipment Furniture Electronic equipment Basic hardware and software M otocars, motor vehicles and similar

2% 8,3% - 8,5%
8.80% 16.20%
20% 20%

The book value of tangible fixed assets is subject to verification in order to report any impairments, should events or changes of situation suggest that the book value may not be recovered. Should there be an indication of this type and in the event the book value should exceed the presumed recoverable amount, the assets are depreciated until they reach their realisable value. The recoverable amount of the tangible fixed assets is the greater of the net selling price and the value-in-use. Impairments are reported in the Income Statement in the costs for depreciations and write downs. Such losses of value are restored should the reasons for their cause cease to exist. When the asset is sold or if there are no future economic benefits expected from the use of the asset, it is eliminated from the financial statements and any loss or profit (calculated as the difference between the selling value and the book value) is entered in the Income Statement of the year of the above-mentioned elimination.
Investments: equity investments entered herein refer to lasting investments. The Company classifies shareholdings in the following categories: - Shareholdings in subsidiaries - Shareholdings in jointly controlled companies - Shareholdings in associates; - Other Shareholdings

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|15 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Shareholdings in subsidiaries, Shareholdings in jointly controlled companies and Shareholdings in associates: The comparison between the book value of the investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled companies and associates and the share pertaining to the Company could give rise to situations in which the value recorded in the financial statements differs from the total shareholders' equity of the investee at the reporting date. For the purposes of the annual verification of the possible impairment of the carrying amounts of investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled companies and associates, the Directors determine the value-in-use for each of them. The value-in-use is calculated by using the projection of the cash flows contained in the economic and financial plans of the individual subsidiaries that have been approved by the Board of Directors. After examining the results of the impairment test on the individual shareholdings, any value adjustments are recorded. The main benchmarks adopted upon evaluating the value-in-use, both in terms of growth rates for the periods subsequent to those illustrated in the plans and in terms of the discount rate, are consistent with those considered in the impairment tests of the goodwill allocated to the CGUs in the consolidated financial statements, to which reference should be made for further details.
Shareholdings in other companies: equity investments in companies that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures (normally with a share interest not exceeding 20%) are classified in non-current financial assets and entered at their fair value if it can be determined. Should the share interest be in companies not publicly traded, share interests are valued at the cost of purchase or subscription, minus any repayment of principal, and are subsequently adjusted for impairments determined in the same manner previously described for the tangible assets.
Other non-current Assets: they are entered at nominal value. Said value may be amended in case of impairment, for an amount equal to the amortised cost.
Financial Assets: the Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories identified by IFRS 9: - financial assets measured at amortised cost; - assets at fair value with the contra-item "Other components of comprehensive income" (FVOCI); - assets at fair value with the contra-item "Profit or loss for the year" (FVTPL).
Financial assets measured at amortised cost: this category includes the financial assets for which the following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is the possession of the asset aimed at the collection of contractual financial flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the asset envisage cash flows represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be returned. These mainly refer to receivables from customers and/or loans that contain a significant financial component. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financial component are instead recognised at the price defined for the related transaction. Subsequent measurements of the assets belonging to this category are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate. Any provisions for the write-down of such receivables are determined with the forward looking approach using a three-stage model: 1) recognition of expected losses in the first 12 months upon initial recognition of the receivable if the credit risk has not increased; 2) recognition of expected losses over the life of the receivable if the credit-related risk increases significantly as compared to the initial recognition; interest is recognised on a gross basis; 3) recognition of the additional losses expected over the life of the receivable as the losses occur; interest is recognised on a net basis.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|16 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Assets at fair value with the contra-item "Other components of comprehensive income" (FVOCI): financial assets with the following characteristics are classified in this category: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both through the sale of the asset itself and through the collection of contractual cash flows; and (ii) the contractual terms of the asset include cash flows represented solely by payments of principal and interest on the amount of the principal to be returned. Any write-downs for permanent losses in value, interest income and gains or losses due to exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Assets at fair value with the contra-item "Profit or loss for the year" (FVTPL): this category includes all the financial assets that do not meet the conditions, in terms of business model or characteristics of the flows generated, for the purposes of measurement at amortised cost or at fair value with a contra-entry in the comprehensive income statement. The assets belonging to this category are classified under current or non-current assets according to their natural maturity and recorded at fair value upon initial recognition. During the subsequent measurement, the profits and losses deriving from changes in fair value are reported in the income statement in the period in which they are detected.
Value adjustments: financial assets are measured based on the credit loss assessment model in application of the incurred losses criterion. The Company has decided to assess the credit risk assuming a total write-down of receivables past due by over 365 days and a partial write-down of those overdue by more than 180 days already in the past. The predictive process is supported by the monthly use of the provision for doubtful accounts set aside based on the execution of cycles of reminders and recovery of outstanding receivables. The historical series relating to past years have shown that the write-down made in predictive terms is a reasonable overestimate of the actual losses that the Company incurs due to its end customers.
Trade receivables and other current assets: trade receivables and other current assets, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, are not discounted back and are booked at amortised cost net of the relevant value losses. These are suited to their presumed realisation value through the reporting in a specific adjustment fund, which is constituted when there is objective evidence that the Company will be unable to receive credit for the original value. Provisions to the reserve for doubtful accounts are reported on the income statement. Additionally, the Company sells some of its trade receivables through sale operations of receivables ("factoring"). Factoring transactions are with recourse.
Cash and cash equivalents: they include cash values, values available at sight and other short-term financial investments. They are accounted at nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments: the Company holds derivative instruments for the purposes of hedging its exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates with reference to two loans taken out during 2019 at a variable rate. The instruments used to manage the risk related to the volatility of goods prices basically consist in Interest Rate Swap agreements, aimed at avoiding impacts on the income statement deriving from changes in the interest rates to which the financial charges of the abovementioned loan agreements are indexed. The transactions which, pursuant to risk management policies, satisfy the requirements of the international accounting standards for hedge accounting, are classified as "hedging transactions" (and recognised as set out below). On the contrary, those which, despite having hedging purposes, do not meet the requirements envisaged by the
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|17 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

international standards, are classified as "trading transactions". In this event, the changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur. The fair value is determined based on the reference market value.
Derivatives embedded in financial assets/liabilities are separated and assessed at fair value, except for cases where the strike price of the derivative at the starting date is close to the value determined based on the amortised cost of the reference asset/liability. In this event, the valuation of the embedded derivative is absorbed in the valuation of the asset/financial liability. The fair value measurement of the above-mentioned contracts is performed by using pricing models and based on market data as at 31st December 2019.
Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy based on the methods for determining the fair value itself, or based on the relevance of the information (input) used in determining their value:
(i) Level 1, financial instruments whose fair value is determined on the basis of a price listed in an active market;
(ii) Level 2, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which can be observed directly or indirectly on the market. This category includes instruments valued on the basis of market forward curves and short-term contracts for difference;
(iii) Level 3, financial instruments whose fair value is determined using valuation techniques that use benchmarks which cannot be observed on the market, that is using exclusively internal estimates.
The Company, as of 31st December 2019 has only one type of financial instruments on interest rates falling within the scope of level 1.
Own shares: Re-acquired own shares are taken as a decrease in the assets. The original cost of own shares, revenues from sales and any other subsequent variation are recognised under the net equity.
Benefits for employees: benefits guaranteed to employees, paid when or after employment ceases, by means of programmes with defined benefits (Employees' leaving indemnities) or with other long-term benefits (retirement indemnity) are recognised in the period when the right accrues. The liability related to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognised on an accrual basis consistent with the employment period required to obtain the benefits. Defined benefit plans also include severance indemnity (TFR) owed to the employees of the Company pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, accrued prior to the reform of this regulation occurred in 2007 (Finance Act of 27th December 2006 no. 296), subsequent to which, for companies employing more than 50 persons and for quotas accrued commencing 1st January 2007, the Severance indemnity is classified as a defined contribution plan. The Company's obligations are separately determined for each plan, by estimating the present value of future benefits that employees have accrued during the current year and in previous financial periods. This calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|18 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

The components of the defined benefits are recognised as follows: (i) the re-measurement components of liabilities, which include actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income (loss); (ii) costs related to the provision of services are recognised in the income statement; (iii) net financial charges in the defined benefit liability are recognised in the income statement.
The re-measurement components recognised in Other comprehensive income (loss) are never reclassified in the profit and loss statement of the following years. For the Severance indemnity accrued after 1st January 2007, the company is only required to pay contributions to the State (so-called Fondo INPS) or to a trust fund or a legally separate entity (so-called Fund) and is determined based on contributions due. Moreover, the Company has signed compensation plans partly based on Ascopiave S.p.A. shares and settled through the delivery of shares (stock option plans, long-term incentive plans), recognised as liabilities and measured at fair value at the end of each accounting period and up to the time of payment (approval of 2020 financial statements). Any subsequent change in fair value is recognised in the income statement. The remaining part of the plan instead is paid in the form of options that can only be sold for cash. The cost of cash operations is evaluated initially at the fair value as of the date of allocation. In particular, the plans adopted by the Company include the allocation of rights including acknowledgement in favour of the beneficiaries of an extraordinary payment linked to the achievement of pre-set objectives, the financial settlement of which is based on the trend of the share title. This fair value is booked in the period until maturation with reporting of a corresponding payable. The liability is re-calculated upon each reporting date, until the date of settlement, with all changes made to the fair value reported on the income statement. In 2015, the compensation plans relating to the previous three-year period were settled; as a consequence, 99,078 shares were assigned. Pursuant to the rules governing the plan, there were no other allocations in the period, since the benefits will accrue at the end of the period. These compensation plans are recognised in compliance with the requirements set out in IFRS 2. For more details on the compensations paid during the year 2015, please refer to "Section II" of the Remuneration Report, prepared pursuant to Art. 123-ter, Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 (TUF).

Provisions for risks and charges: The provisions for risks and charges concern costs and charges of a given type, and

of certain or probable existence, which on the closing date of the financial year are undetermined in terms of amount

or due date.

Provisions are reported when:

i)

There likely is a current obligation (legal or implicit) that derives from a past event;

ii)

An outlay of resources is likely in order to meet the obligation;

iii)

A reasonable estimate can be made as to the amount of the obligation.

On the other hand, where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate as to the obligation, or alternatively, it is

deemed that the outlay of financial resources is only possible and not probable, the relevant potential liability is not

entered in the financial statements, but rather mentioned appropriately in the explanatory notes.

Provisions are reported at the representative value of the best estimate of the amount that the company would pay to

extinguish the obligation, or to transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. If the effect of discounting is

significant, the allocations are determined by discounting back the expected future financial flows at a pre-tax rate

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|19 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

which reflects the market's current valuation in relation to time. When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the passing of time is reported as a financial charge.
Financial liabilities: financial liabilities include the medium and long-term loans recorded initially at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred and, subsequently, measured at amortised cost, calculated by applying the effective interest rate, net of principal repayments already made. When a condition of a long-term financing contract is violated, on or before the date of the financial statements, causing the liability to become payable on demand, the liability is classified as current, even if the lender has agreed - after the reference date of the financial statements and before the authorisation for its publishing - not to require the payment because of the breach. The liability is classified as current because, as of the date of the financial statements, the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for at least twelve months after that date.
Trade payables and other liabilities: trade payables, whose expiry is within normal commercial trading terms, refer to financial liabilities resulting from trade transactions and are recognised at amortised cost. Payables in a currency other than the account currency are booked at the exchange rate of the day of the transaction and, subsequently, are converted at the exchange rate as of the date of financial statements. Any profit or loss deriving from conversion is reported in the income statement.
Revenues and costs: revenues and costs are booked on an accrual basis. The recognition of revenue from contracts with customers is based on the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract with the customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations, represented by the contractual promises to transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations identified on the basis of the stand-alone selling price of each good or service; (v) recognition of the revenue when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled, i.e. when the promised good or service is transferred to the customer; the transfer is considered completed when the customer obtains control of the good or service, which can occur continuously (over time) or at a specific time (at a point in time). Revenues are entered net of all discounts, rebates and premiums, as well as the taxes directly connected.
Financial income and expenses: income and costs are booked on an accrual basis according to the interest accrued on the net value of the relevant financial assets and liabilities, using the actual interest rate.
Income taxes: current taxes are calculated based on an estimate of the income before tax and are entered at the amount that is expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. The rates and tax regulations used to calculate the amount are those issued or basically issued upon year end. Current taxes relating to elements reported directly under assets are reported directly as assets and under the other items of the comprehensive income statement. As far as the Tax on Company Revenue (IRES) is concerned, the subsidiaries of Ascopiave S.p.A. exercised the option for the national tax consolidation regime pursuant to art. 117/129 of the Unified Law on Revenue Taxes (TUIR) for the 2019 -2021 three-year period. This option enables the calculation of IRES based on a taxable amount equal to the mathematical sum of the positive and negative taxable amounts of the single companies that comprise the
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|20 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

consolidation. Ascopiave S.p.A. acts as consolidating company and determines a single taxable amount for the Group of companies that are part of the national consolidation regime.
Each of the participating companies transfers its income tax (taxable income or tax loss) to the consolidating company recognising therefore in the income statement the item "tax consolidation charges" or "tax consolidation income" for an amount equal to the current IRES rate for the financial year (or the loss transferred), that will be paid or used by the parent company Ascopiave S.p.A.. Deferred tax assets are reported against all deductible temporary differences and for tax assets and liabilities brought forward, to the extent that the existence of suitable future tax income that enables the use of deductible temporary differences and tax assets and liabilities brought forward is probable, except for the following:
(i) when deferred payable tax assets connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial reporting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a company merger and that, at the time of the transaction itself, has no effect on the profit of the year calculated for the purposes of the statements, nor on the profit or loss calculated for tax purposes;
(ii) regarding taxable temporary differences associated with holdings in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, the deferred tax assets are reported only in the amount in which it is probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the immediate future and that there is suitable tax income against which the temporary differences can be used.
Earnings per share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares net of own shares. For the purposes of the calculation of the basic earnings per share, we specify that the numerator is the profit for the period. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Company. Diluted profit per share is equal to that per share in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.
Asset impairment: the Company performs at least once a year an impairment test on tangible and intangible assets if their useful lives are indefinite or, more often, in the presence of events suggesting that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Amortisation and depreciation: amortisation and depreciation are calculated based on the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the concession; the useful life is determined by the directors, with the assistance of technical experts, when the asset is entered in the financial statements; the assessments about the duration of the useful lives are based on historical experience, market conditions and expectations of future events that could affect the useful life, including technological innovations. On a regular basis, the company evaluates technological and sector changes, dismantling and close-down charges and the recovery value in order to update the asset's remaining useful life. This periodic update may lead to a change in the depreciation/amortisation period and thus the depreciation/amortisation quota for future periods.
Provisions for risks: these provisions have been devised by adopting the same procedures as in the previous years and by referring to the updated reports prepared by the lawyers and consultants who are examining the disputes, as well as based on the procedural developments of the latter.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|21 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Provision for doubtful accounts: the provision for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated losses connected with the receivables of the company. Provisions have been established to cover specific cases of insolvency, as well as in relation to expected bad debts estimated based on experience with respect to receivables with a similar risk profile.
INFORMATION ON MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION ACTIVITIES
Ascopiave S.p.A. is not subject to management and coordination activities by Asco Holding S.p.A. since it operates in conditions of corporate and entrepreneurial autonomy with respect to its parent company. Asco Holding S.p.A. avails itself of some services offered by Ascopiave S.p.A. and other subsidiary companies of the latter, on an arm's length basis, for organisation and economic reasons.

Land and buildings This item is mainly made up of the buildings owned in relation to company headquarters, offices and secondary warehouses. At the end of the year, the item did not register investments and the variation is explained by depreciation.
Plants and machinery The item Plants and machinery decreased from Euro 587 thousand in the previous year, to Euro 530 thousand in the year considered. This change is due to the depreciation of the period for Euro 57 thousand.
Industrial and commercial equipment The item "Industrial and commercial equipment" in the period considered did not register investments and the change is due to the depreciation of the period.
Other assets In the period considered, the item "other assets" registered investments for Euro 620 thousand, mainly related to costs for hardware and telephone equipment.
Tangible assets in progress and advance payments The item mainly includes costs incurred for extraordinary maintenance of company headquarters and/or peripheral warehouses. During the year, the item changed by Euro 364 thousand.
Rights of use The item includes the rights of use related to the first application of IFRS 16 on 1st January 2019. The effect of the application of the new standard mainly concerned operating leases relating to tangible fixed assets such as rental of vehicles and trucks for Euro 205 thousand. During the year, the change recorded by the item, net of the first recognition at cost of the commitments, amounts to Euro 65 thousand, equal to the depreciation for the period.

The shareholders' equity and operating result of the subsidiaries or affiliates shown in the tables above relate to the draft financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2019 and approved by the Boards of Directors of the investee companies.
The comparison between the book value of the investments in subsidiaries and associates and the share pertaining to the Company gives rise to situations in which the value recorded in the financial statements is higher than the total shareholders' equity of the investee at the reporting date. For the purposes of the annual verification of the possible impairment of the carrying amounts of investments in gas distribution subsidiaries, the Directors determine the value-in-use for each of them. The value-in-use is calculated by using the projection of the cash flows contained in the 2020-2022 economic and financial plans of the individual subsidiaries that have been approved by the Board of Directors. After examining the results of the impairment test on the individual shareholdings, no value write-downs were recorded. The main benchmarks adopted upon evaluating the value-in-use, both in terms of growth rates for the periods subsequent to those illustrated in the plans and in terms of the discount rate, are consistent with those considered in the impairment tests of the goodwill allocated to the CGUs in the consolidated financial statements, to which reference should be made for further details. As regards the book value of the investments in EstEnergy S.p.A. and in Hera Comm S.p.A., as they were acquired towards the end of the year, the price paid represents the fair value.

The value corresponds to the net book value of the distribution plants delivered in August 2007 to the same municipality following the date of expiry of the concession, on 31st December 2006. The value of the receivables corresponds to what the municipality of Santorso has been asked to pay as per the "Letta" legislative decree, article 15, paragraph 5, as indemnification of the industrial value of the network, in line with the estimations outlined in a suitable appraisal.
As of 31st December 2019, there is an on-going litigation with the municipality mentioned above in order to define the value of compensation of the delivered distribution systems. The evolution of these disputes can be found in the paragraph "Litigations" of these financial statements.

The item refers to the receivables from the municipalities of Creazzo and Costabissara. As regards the municipality of Creazzo the infrastructure was delivered subsequent to the natural expiry of the concession on 31st December 2004.

In order to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute, on 1st March 2017 the technicians in charge of estimating the plants proposed a comprehensive value of Euro 1,678 thousand (to be paid in instalments over 12 years). The value entered under non-current financial assets represents the portion due beyond 12 months from the reporting date and, due to the duration of the agreed instalments, the item was discounted. The Municipality, with City Council Resolution no. 18 dated 22nd March 2018, definitively approved the settlement deed above, executed on 2nd August 2018.
As regards the receivable from the municipality of Costabissara, it will be collected beyond 12 months from the reporting date. A settlement agreement was signed with the Municipality on 3rd June 2019 for assessing the value of the natural gas distribution infrastructure, which had been delivered on 1st October 2011. The parties agreed an amount of Euro 3,000 thousand, of which Euro 1,000 thousand paid on 5th July 2019, while the remainder will be paid in 12 annual instalments having the same amount.

The Company has performed a full accounting of advance taxes concerning temporary differences between taxable values and book values, as the Company supposes that future tax bases could take up all temporary differences that generated them. In determining the advanced taxes, we referred to IRES (taxes on company income) and, where applicable, to the IRAP in force when the temporary differences are expected to be carried forward. In particular, a 24% IRES tax rate and a 4.2% IRAP rate were applied.

The total value of the temporary differences and the amounts on which the deferred tax assets were calculated are as follows:

The increase in the provision for risks and charges amounting to Euro 352 thousand is mainly explained by the recognition of costs accrued in the period in question for long-term incentive plans.

330 (0) (11) 289

The liability of the severance indemnity is calculated with the actuarial method. Its value is therefore subjected to variation between the various assumptions. The main assumptions used for the measurement of the severance indemnity is the discount rate, the average yearly employee turnover and maximum retiring age of employees. The discount rate used to measure the liability deriving from severance indemnity is determined from market trend of high quality bonds (AA rating or better) with due dates and amounts corresponding to due dates and amounts of expected future payments. For this plan, the average discount rate reflecting the due dates and amounts of future payments for 2019 amounts to 0.79%. The main additional assumptions of the model are:
· Mortality rate: IPS55 survival table · Inability rates: INPS tables year 2000 · Personnel rotation rate: 3.00% · Annual probability rate of TFR down payment: 2.00% · Increase in remuneration rate: 1.50 % · Inflation rate: 0.80%
The sensitivity analysis on the actuarial evaluation of the provision did not highlight substantial discrepancies compared to the value entered in the financial statements. The current cost related to work performance is included as personnel costs, while the interest cost is recorded under financial income and expense.

In fact, in 2019 the national tax consolidation agreement in force as of 31st December 2018 with Asco Holding S.p.A. expired due to the lack of some necessary requirements.

Earnings per share
As required by the IAS 33 accounting standard, the following information is provided about the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to the Company's shareholders by the number of shares, net of own shares. There are no preference dividends, conversions of preferred shares or similar effects that would adjust the results attributable to the holders of ordinary shares. Diluted profit per share is equal to that per share in that ordinary shares that could have a dilutive effect do not exist and no shares or warrants exist that could have the same effect.

The result and the number of ordinary shares used to calculate base earning per share, identified according to the

method set out in IAS 33 are reported below:

Hedging policies
Information pertaining to agreements not stated in the balance sheet Pursuant to art. 2427, first paragraph, point 22-ter, Italian Civil Code, introduced by Legislative Decree 173 on 23rd November 2008, we announce that the company has not entered into agreements not disclosed in the balance sheet.
Management of financial risk: objectives and criteria The main financial liabilities of Ascopiave S.p.A. include bank loans, lease contracts with the possibility of purchase and short-term debit bank balances. The main objective of these financial liabilities is to finance the company's operating activities. Ascopiave S.p.A. holds several financial assets such as trade receivables and short-term deposits and reserves that derive directly from the company's operating activity. The main risks generated by the financial instruments of Ascopiave S.p.A. are the interest rate risk and the liquidity risk. The Board of Directors re-examines and identifies the policies for risk management, described hereinafter.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|58 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Interest rate risk Ascopiave S.p.A. manages its liquidity needs both through temporary credit lines and short-term loans at variable rates which, due to their continuous fluctuation, do not make it easy to hedge against interest rate risk, and through medium/long-term loans with fixed and variable rates. The medium-long term loans, with variable and fixed rates, have a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 165,111 thousand and expiration dates between 1st January 2020 and 28th February 2030. Medium and long term loans at variable rate envisage reimbursement between 2020 and 2025, with residual balance as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 81,500 thousand (Euro 26,250 thousand as of 31st December 2018), represented by:
- Loan with the European Investment Bank disbursed in August 2013 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 21,500 thousand,
- Loan with BNL disbursed in August 2019 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 30,000 thousand, the latter hedged by a financial derivative with effect from February 2020, for which the interest rate risk is therefore neutralised,
- Loan with Crédit Agricole - Friuladria granted in October 2019 with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 30,000 thousand; the latter is hedged by a financial derivative instrument, and therefore its interest rate risk is neutralised.
As of 31st December 2019, the derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates, relating to the loans taken out with BNL and Crédit Agricole - Friuladria, detailed in paragraph no. 20 "Current liabilities on derivative financial instruments" and whose mark to market amounts to Euro 98 thousand in total, are effective. The following loans are not exposed to interest rate risks, as they envisage the application of a fixed rate:
- the loan taken out with BNL in August 2017, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 25,000 thousand,
- the loan signed with Cassa Centrale Banca at the beginning of 2018, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 8,611 thousand,
- the loan taken out with Intesa SanPaolo in November 2019, with a residual debt as of 31st December 2019 of Euro 50,000 thousand.
The loans above are subjected to covenants calculated on the consolidated data of the Ascopiave Group. Please refer to Paragraph no. 16 "Medium and Long Term Loans" for additional details.

The sensitivity analysis, obtained by simulating a variation on interest tax rates applied on the credit lines of the Company equal to 50 basis points in decrease (with a minimum limit of zero basis points) and 200 basis points in increase, maintaining unchanged all the other variables, leads to an estimation of an effect on the result before taxes which is negative for Euro 3,467 thousand (2018: Euro 2,757 thousand) or positive for Euro 867 thousand (2018: Euro 689 thousand).

Receivable risk policy Credit risk represents the Company's exposure to potential losses arising from the counterparties' failure to meet their obligations. The failure or delay in the payment of fees owed may have a negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the Company. Considered the type of business of Ascopiave S.p.A., said risk is of little concern to the Company.

Liquidity risk Ascopiave S.p.A. constantly pursues the aim of maintaining the stability and flexibility between financing sources and uses, in its capacity as treasury manager for the Group. The two main factors influencing the liquidity of Ascopiave S.p.A. are, on the one hand, the resources generated or absorbed by operations or investments, on the other hand, and the expiry and debt renewal characteristics. Under note 16, medium/long-term financial payables are detailed according to their date of expiry, as of 31st December 2019. Liquidity requirements are constantly monitored by the Treasury Department of Ascopiave S.p.A., in order to ensure that financial resources are easily identifiable and collectible, or that appropriate investments are made in relation to cash or cash equivalents. The Directors believe that the reserves and credit lines currently available, as well as those that will be generated by the operating and financial activities, will enable the fulfilment of the requirements connected to investments, management of circulating capital and to the reimbursement of debt upon date of expiry.

Information on Covid 19 During the first months of 2020, the world has been progressively struck by the international health emergency caused by the Covid 19 virus, the so-called Coronavirus. The emergency has affected several countries and, as the days go by, it is spreading and striking many others.

A settlement agreement is being negotiated.
LITIGATIONS ON THE VALUE OF PLANTS ­ ARBITRATIONS As of 31st December 2019 no litigations are pending.
ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2019 the following are pending:
GUIDELINES ­ MINISTERIAL DECREE 22nd MAY 2014 An appeal before the Council of State was filed (with deed dated 16th January 2017) by Ascopiave S.p.A. together with other distribution companies, against the Minister of Economic Development for the cancellation of Judgment no. 10341 dated 17th October 2016, by which the Regional Administrative Court of Latium rejected the main appeal against Ministerial Decree 22nd May 2014 concerning the introduction of the Guidelines for the determination of the residual industrial value and the appeal for "additional grounds" against Ministerial Decree no. 106 dated 20th May 2015, amending Ministerial Decree 226/2011.

|63 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

As part of the same proceedings, the issues of constitutional legitimacy and/or preliminary ruling as concerns Law 9 and 116 of 2014, in the section which has modified art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (private contributions and time limit of agreements' validity) were raised. The Council of State decided to refer the matter (of the legitimacy of the primary regulations) to the examination of the European Court of Justice. The Court of Justice ruled that the European law does not preclude the national legislation challenged (but) in the sense that the law itself does not govern (and therefore is not affected by) the methods for determining the reimbursement value of the outgoing operators. The hearing for the "re-assumption" of the case before the Council of State was held on 18th July. Ascopiave S.p.A.'s lawyers reaffirmed the relevance of the issue of constitutionality of the legislation.
ARERA RESOLUTIONS ARG/GAS 310/2014 and ARG/GAS 414/2014 (now 905/2017) An appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lombardy ­ Milan against the ARERA, for the cancellation of the Resolutions ARG/gas 310 and 414/2014 related to the methods for assessing the RAB RIV delta, pursuant to art. 15, paragraph 5 of Legislative Decree 164/2000 (current text) when the difference is higher than 10%. To date, there are no further procedural steps. Resolutions 310 and 414 were formally repealed by Resolution 905/2017 which, however, essentially reiterated the same regulation. Ascopiave, therefore, together with other appellants, in order to avoid the declaration stating that the appeal would in any case be of no benefit to the claimants, appealed Resolution 905/2017 with "additional grounds". On 3rd December 2019, the Company was notified of the imminent expiration of the proceedings. The Company will consequently file the request for scheduling a hearing, within the deadlines set.
CONTESTATION OF PASUBIO GROUP S.P.A. CONTRACT DOCUMENTS (currently AP Reti Gas Vicenza S.p.A.): 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. filed an appeal before the Regional Administrative Court of Veneto against the Town of Schio and Ascopiave S.p.A. (notified on 10th October 2016), demanding annulation, subject to protective orders, of the temporary award of the tender to Ascopiave S.p.A., or the call for tenders and all subsequent acts, requesting that the tender be awarded to the appellant or, subordinately, be republished. The Administrative Court of Veneto (hearing dated 9th November 2016) overruled the protective order by 2i Rete Gas. The claimant then filed a claim to the Council of State. The C.o.S. overruled the request for a single-judge solution and opted for a full Council sentence. On 2nd February 2017, the Council of State hearing took place. During the hearing, the Council sustained the supervision order 644/2016 of Administrative Court of Veneto, thus rejecting the appeal by 2i Rete Gas S.p.A. for the suspension of application of the tender document pending decision on the main appeal to the Administrative Court of Veneto. As a result, on 3rd April 2017 Ascopiave S.p.A. stipulated a sale agreement to purchase the share interest of Pasubio Group, becoming its sole shareholder. With Judgement no. 925/2019, published on 14th August 2019, the Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeal. The terms for the possible appeal of 2i Rete Gas are currently pending.

|64 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

CIVIL LITIGATIONS ­ NOT CONCERNING CONCESSIONS As of 31st December 2019 the following are pending:
ASCOPIAVE ­ UNIT B: A civil judgment before the Court of Treviso (RG 6941/2013), following the pre-trial technical investigation, in order to obtain compensation for damages to the entrance floor of the "Unit B", was started by Ascopiave S.p.A. against: Bandiera Architetti S.r.l. (Designers), Mr Mario Bertazzon (Contract Manager) and Mr R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali S.r.l. (Contractor). The compensation request refers to an assessment of damage between approximately Euro 127 thousand (Expert witness estimate for full restoration) and Euro 208 thousand (estimate of a Third-party firm for full makeover). All the Parties regularly appeared before the Court. The Court, by Order dated 22nd December 2014, decided the complete renewal of the expert witness board. The "new" Court-appointed Expert witness assessed that the damage suffered by Ascopiave S.p.A. amounts to approximately Euro 120 thousand. Based on the findings contained in the technical report, on 29th March 2016 an attempt was made to reach settlement in court. The attempt failed basically because an agreement was not reached regarding the subdivision of the amount between the debtors. With Judgment no. 2007/2017, the Court accepted the application submitted by Ascopiave S.p.A., ordering the design firm (F.lli Bandiera), its insurance company (Groupama Assicurazioni) and the construction company (Ing. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali SRL) to pay damages, amounting to approximately Euro 208 thousand, and to reimburse the costs of the proceedings (estimated at approximately Euro 17 thousand). Furthermore, the debtors' obligation to assume joint and several liability was ratified. The project management (and consequently the insurance company, Unipol Sai) was found to be uninvolved in the damage, with a right to obtain compensation for the costs of the proceedings, amounting to about Euro 16 thousand. With two separate documents, Groupama Assicurazioni and Ing. R. Paccagnella Lavori Speciali notified the appeal against the First Instance Judgment. Ascopiave S.p.A. entered an appearance in accordance with the legal terms. By Provision dated 7th June 2018, the Court of Appeal partially accepted the suspension request, limiting the provisional enforceability of the First instance sentence to the amount of Euro 150 thousand, against which Ascopiave S.p.A. is entitled to pursue the enforcement. At the hearing of 28th June 2018, the Court of Appeal unified the appeals.
FORCED ENTRY ­ DEFAULT SERVICE Pursuant to the regulation obligation (specifically about Art. 40.2 letter A of the Integrated Text for the Sale of Gas TIVG), AP Reti Gas S.p.A. (as the other distribution companies of the Group) may, pursuant to Art. 700 of the Civil Procedural Code, obtain forced entry to private property in order to disconnect utilities (when the meter is located in a private property) of Default Service (SDD) clients that are in default. Appeals are made against final customers (or utility users).
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|65 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

For this purpose (and to meet provisions of the regulations), the company has created a management procedure that starts with the activation of the SDD and ends with its closure (for any reason) of the SDD. The procedure also envisages to close any controversy via ordinary methods, collection of information, gathering of previous data and/or efforts to contact the involved final customers, notification of delays, past due notifications and, if all of the above prove unsuccessful, the opening of a judicial procedure, normally as an urgent appeal pursuant to Art. 700 of the Civil Procedural Code. Other distribution companies of the Group have opted for the same solution. Currently, for Ascopiave / AP Reti: - 4 procedures are in progress (they have been sent to the Legal Office and are awaiting filing); - 6 procedures have been filed (hearings already scheduled/under scrutiny); - 1 procedure is in execution of judgment; - 10 procedures are being initiated (their appeals are being drafted and sent to the Legal Office); - 3 procedures have been suspended (for various reasons); - 247 procedures have been completed (in various stages). Between 30 and 50 procedures for which legal action is likely to be taken are expected every year for all Group companies. The procedure and the consequent actions undertaken in the preliminarily phase have resulted in a significant reduction in legal actions, compared to the extent originally envisaged. As of 31st December 2019, the total legal fees (including taxes), for Ascopiave S.p.A. / AP Reti Gas S.p.A.'s procedures forwarded to the Legal Office, amount to approximately Euro 212 thousand.
Relationships with Agenzia delle Entrate (Italian Tax Authority)
ROBIN TAX Regarding the outstanding litigations with Agenzia delle Entrate, some claims are pending with local tax agencies related to the silent / express refusal to reimburse the additional IRES tax (so-called Robin Tax). The Companies involved in the afore-mentioned litigations are: Amgas Blu S.r.l., Ascopiave S.p.A., Ascotrade S.p.A., Ap Reti Gas Rovigo S.r.l., Asm Set S.r.l., Blue Meta S.p.A., Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A. (former Pasubio Servizi), Unigas Distribuzione (merged into Ascopiave), Asco Energy S.p.A. (former Veritas Energia). Since 2008, these Ascopiave Group companies are subjected to the additional IRES tax as set forth by Art. 81 of Law Decree 112/2008. Subsequently the Constitutional Court in 2015 declared that said tax would be unconstitutional. In the wake of said sentence, the companies requested the reimbursement of the unwarranted tax that had been paid. The tax authorities did not reply and by doing so they effectively denied the reimbursement, or expressly denied it. Several claims have been filed based on a retroactive interpretation of said sentence, the legitimacy of which was confirmed by a Constitutional Law Attorney. Possible results of said claims are completely unpredictable, as the sustainment of the claim would cause a massive financial burden for the entire country. As far as the expected time of resolution of this litigation, no temporary framework can be provided, as these claims have been filed to various local courts with different response times. So far, only the appeals relating to the companies Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Unigas Distribuzione S.r.l., Ascopiave S.p.A., Edigas Distribuzione Gas S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A. and the merged company
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
|66 Ascopiave S.p.A. ­ Annual Financial Report as of 31st December 2019

Edigas Due S.p.A. have been discussed, while for the company Amgas Blu S.r.l. the merit hearings are still to be scheduled. With reference to the outcome of the litigations in progress, the result of the first instance was favourable to Agenzia delle Entrate and the companies decided to appeal against the judgement of the provincial tax commission. Currently, some regional tax commissions have already confirmed the first instance judgements (Ascopiave S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A.). The other tax commissions, on the other hand, are still awaiting judgment. The Company has decided to appeal in all 3 levels of judgment.
AUDIT OF THE REGIONAL DIRECTION OF VENETO In September 2019, the companies Ascopiave S.p.A. and Ascotrade S.p.A. were inspected by the Regional Direction of Agenzia delle Entrate as regards the Ires, Irap and VAT sectors for the years from 2013 to the date of the inspection. On 29th October 2019 the Report on Findings containing remarks on the direct and indirect taxes related to the years 2013 and 2014 was issued, against which the company presented its briefs. On 31st December 2019, Agenzia delle Entrate issued the tax demand relating to the disputed matters, following which the Company, on 27th February 2020, filed an appeal with the Provincial Tax Commission of Venice, deeming that valid arguments exist to believe that the conduct of the Company is entirely legitimate. The company, aided by the tax advisor, considers the risk as "possible" or "remote" and therefore has not made any provision.

Proposal of the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting
The Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A., considering the results of the period and solidity of the capital, will propose to the Shareholders' Meeting the distribution of a dividend of Euro 0.2133 per share, for a total of Euro 47.8 million; this amount is calculated on the basis of outstanding shares at the end of 2019. Ascopiave S.p.A. announces that, if approved on first call, the dividend will be paid on 13th May 2020 with ex-dividend date on 11th May 2020 (record date on 12th May 2020) and, if approved on second call, the dividend will be paid on 10th June 2020 with ex-dividend date on 8th June 2020 (record date on 9th June 2020). The Board of Directors will not propose to any amount to legal reserve, as it is already equal to one fifth of the share capital.

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

11

The Issuer's Articles of Association that regulate the composition and nomination of the Board (Articles 14 and 15) are qualified to guarantee the respect of the dispositions introduced by Law 262/2005 (Article 147-ter of the Consolidated Financial Law ) and by Legislative Decree no. 303 dated 29th December 2006, and Law dated 11th July 2011 no. 120.
With reference to the structure and appointment of the board of directors, the Company Articles of Association was amended by the Shareholders' Meeting in extraordinary session on 28th April 2017. The amendments approved by the Shareholders' Meeting concern a change in articles 14 (with reference to the composition of the board of directors) and 15 of the Company Articles of Association (with reference to the appointment of the board of directors) in order to introduce an increase in the number of directors from 5 (five) to 6 (six), a reformulation of art. 18 (with reference to the validity of the resolutions of the Board of Directors) in order to introduce the principle of the so-called casting vote of the Chairman in case of equal votes, as well as a renumbering of paragraphs of art. 15.
According to Article 15 of the Company Articles of Association, the members of the Board of Directors are appointed through the so-called list vote based on the lists presented by the shareholders that, alone or with other shareholders, own shares for at least 2.5% of the share capital, or the maximum participation in the share capital required for submitting the lists by the applicable legislative and regulatory provisions ("shareholding"). The shareholding shall be reported in the summons notice of the Assembly, which shall take a decision on the appointment of the board of Directors. Article 15 of the Company Articles of Association also states that the lists presented by the shareholders be deposited at the Company Headquarters within the deadline envisaged, every time, by the current and relevant regulations.
Together with each list, within the afore-stated deadlines, the declarations, with which the single candidates accept the candidature and certify under their responsibility, the non-existence of ineligibility and incompatibility causes, and the possession of the requested data envisaged by the Normative applicable each time must be published. The first candidate of each list must own the requirements of independence envisaged by Article 148, subpar 3 of Legislative Decree dated 24th February 1998, no. 58 (and subsequent amendments) and by the codes of behaviour drawn up by management companies of the market that the Company accepted.
The lists having at least 3 candidates cannot be exclusively composed of candidates of the same gender (male or female). The candidates of the least represented gender cannot be less than one third (rounded up) of all the candidates in the list, pursuant to art. 15 of the Company Articles of Association.
After the vote of the assembly, if two or more lists are submitted: (i) all candidates, up to a maximum of five, will be elected from the list that obtains the highest number of votes and they will be elected as directors, in the progressive order in which they are indicated in this list, except as provided below, to ensure the balance between genders in compliance with the applicable provisions of law and regulation; (ii) the first candidate will be elected from the second list by number of votes obtained and that is not connected in any way, not even indirectly, with the shareholders who presented or voted the list resulting first by number of votes, and he will be elected as director of the list itself;

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

12

(iii) in the event of equality of votes between two or more lists, the candidates of the list that has been presented by the shareholders who own the largest holding or, alternatively, by the largest number of shareholders, will be elected, except as provided below, to ensure the balance between genders in compliance with the applicable provisions of law and regulation;
For the first mandate after the general election of the Board of Directors performer by the shareholders on 28th April 2011, notwithstanding the provisions of Art. 15, the share for the less represented category was equal to one-fifth (rounding up to the higher figure). The share of one-fifth was fulfilled both for the submission of lists with at least three candidates and for the final composition of the Board of Directors, resulting from the election by the Assembly, pursuant to art. 30 of the Articles of Association.
Instead, at the Shareholders' Meeting of 28th April 2017, for the appointment of the second term of the Board of Directors following the entry into force of the law, the share reserved to the less represented gender was equal to one third (rounding up to the higher figure). The appointment mechanism through the so-called list vote guarantees transparency, as well as rapid and adequate information on the personal and professional characteristics of the candidates. The Board of Directors did not set an internal committee for the proposals of appointment as member of the Board of Directors, not deeming it necessary, keeping these functions inside the Board of Directors, in line with the Application Criterion 4.C.2 of the Self-Conduct Code. This choice was dictated by the fact that the applicable regulatory provisions and the provisions of the articles of association - such as, in particular, the appointment through "list vote" ­ give adequate transparency to the recruitment and indication of candidates, also in consideration of the size of the Issuer and of the limited number of members of the administrative and control bodies. If during the financial year, for whatsoever reason, one or more directors taken from the list that obtained the highest number of votes ("Majority Directors") is out, and despite this the majority still holds, the Board will substitute the missing Majority Directors through co-optation, in accordance with Article 2386 C.C., it being understood that if one or more missing majority Directors are Independent directors, other independent directors must be co-opted, respecting applicable regulations governing gender balance. The directors thus remain in charge until the following Meeting that will confirm their appointment or substitution with the ordinary procedures and majorities, as an exception to the list vote system previously indicated. If during the year, for whatsoever reason, one or more directors taken from the first list that obtained the second highest number of votes ("Minority Director") is out and, despite this the majority still holds, the Board will substitute the missing Minority Directors with the first non-elected candidates part of the same list, only if they are still eligible and willing to accept the post, or, if defecting, to the first list following for number of votes between those that achieved a number of votes equal to at least the minimum threshold envisaged in paragraph 15.10 of the Articles of Association , without prejudice, in both cases, to the applicable regulations governing gender balance. The terms of the substitutes elapse along with the directors in charge at the moment of their joining the Board, as an exception to the provisions set forth in Article 2386.1, Civil Code; in the event one or more missing Minority Directors are independent directors, they have to be substituted with other independent directors; if it is not possible to proceed with the afore-stated terms, for insufficient choice on the lists or for the non-availability of the candidates, the Board shall proceed with co-optation, in accordance with Article

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

13

2386 of C.C., of a director chosen by the Board, pursuant to law, in order to respect the legal and regulatory prescriptions related to the presence of the minimum number of independent directors, respecting applicable regulations governing gender balance and also, if possible, the principle of minority representation. The director thus co-opted will remain in charge till the following Meeting that will confirm their appointment or substitution with the ordinary procedures and majorities, as an exception to the list vote system.
The Company's Board of Directors shall propose to the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the 2019 financial statements, the approval of amendments to the Articles of Association aimed at ensuring that the directors are elected according to a criterion ensuring gender balance, based on the requirements of new art. 147-ter, paragraph 1-ter, of the Consolidated Financial Law that provides that "the directors are elected according to a criterion ensuring gender balance. The least represented gender shall have at least two fifths of the elected directors. This allotment criterion shall be applied for six consecutive terms. "
Succession plans In view of the governance structure, of the decision-making system and of the powers, as well as the organizational structure adopted by the Issuer and Ascopiave Group, (where the operating sectors of the companies are divided into activities of raw material distribution and sales to the final customers),aimed at ensuring an adequate separation between the direction, management and control functions and to promote the effective implementation of power balance between the top management, the Board of Directors has decided not to adopt a plan for the succession of executive directors, according to the guidelines 5.C.2 of the Self-Conduct Code. Furthermore, please refer to the replacement procedure of the Directors already envisaged by the existing Articles of Association. In particular, the three-year term of the duration in office of all Directors, pursuant to Art. 15 of the Company Articles of Association require periodic appointments as provided by the relevant Articles of Association In addition, the replacement of the Directors who left office before the expiry is governed by the provisions of the above-mentioned Art. 15 of the Articles of Association.
4.2. STRUCTURE

In addition, the Company's Board of Directors believes that an optimal composition of the Issuer's administration body can be guaranteed by complying with some requirements identified for the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as for the position of member of the Board of Directors.
An adequate diversity of gender, age, seniority, professional and managerial experiences should also be present in the Board of Directors, also taking into account the characteristics and relevance of the previous positions of its members.

(August 2019) and AP Reti Gas Nord Est S.r.l. (from 2020). The Board of Directors made in particular the following assessments:
 the Director is a member of the Executive Committee ("Independent Manager" as provided for by the regulation on functions separation - so-called unbundling), that is, a collegial body expressing and implementing its resolutions through the Executive Committee;
 the Director has not been granted proxies or signature powers in relation to this role;  the Director shall not independently take a decision pertaining to the Executive Committee.

Therefore it decided not to perform the co-option of the resigned director, because of the time needed to identify a new director and the imminence of the Shareholders' Meeting (23/04/2020) held to renew the corporate bodies, among other things, and because the number of independent directors is 3 and therefore s adequate; so, there was no urgency to integrate the Board of Directors

13. APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS
The appointment and replacement of auditors is governed by the laws and regulations of Article 22 of the Issuer's Articles of Association. The Board of Auditors is composed of three statutory auditors and two alternate auditors, whose office lasts three years and which can be re-elected. At least one of the statutory auditors should be: (i) a woman, if the majority of the statutory auditors are men; (ii) a man, if the majority of the statutory auditors are women. In accordance with Article 22 of the Issuer's Articles of Association , the whole Board of Auditors is appointed based on lists presented by Shareholders. Shareholders who alone, or together with other Shareholders, at the time of presentation hold a share of at least 2.5% of the share capital, or, where otherwise, the maximum share of the share capital required for the presentation of lists as specified by applicable provisions of law and regulations, may present lists. The interest share will be specified in the summons notice to the Meeting called to deliberate the appointment of the Board of Auditors. The lists must specify at least one candidate for the office of Statutory Auditor, and one for the office of Alternate Auditor. No candidate may appear in more than one list, at risk of being deemed incompatible. In the lists composed of three or more candidates, the gender of at least one third

(rounded up) of the candidates for the role of statutory auditor and the candidates for the office of alternate auditor must be different from the gender of the other candidates. The lists, signed by the Shareholders presenting them, or by the Shareholder who has been delegated to present them and provided with the documentation specified by this Articles of Association and by current provisions of law and regulations, must be filed at the company headquarters within the terms of the applicable provisions of law and regulations. If, upon expiry of the terms set out by the applicable provisions of law and regulations, only one list of candidates has been presented, or indeed none, the meeting shall deliberate by relative majority of shareholders. In case of a tie between candidates, there will be a second ballot between these, with a further voting by the meeting. Where two or more lists are presented, election of the Board of Auditors shall take place as follows:
(i) in the progressive order in which they have been indicated in the various sections of the list, the following will be appointed from the list that has obtained the greatest number of votes: (a) two statutory auditors and (b) one alternate auditor;
(ii) in the progressive order in which they have been indicated in the various sections of the list, the following will be appointed from the list that has obtained the greatest number of votes, and which is not connected, even indirectly, with the shareholders who presented or voted the list that obtained the greatest number of votes: (a) one statutory auditor, who will also hold the office of Chairman of the Board of Auditors, and (b) one alternate auditor and, where available, further alternate auditors ready to replace the minority member, up to a maximum of three. Where this is not possible, the first candidate of the list having obtained the next greatest number of votes, and which is not connected, even indirectly, with the shareholders who presented or voted the list that obtained the greatest number of votes, will be appointed alternate auditor;
(iii) should votes for two or more lists be equal, the candidates of the list presented by shareholders holding the greatest share, will be appointed, or, subordinate to this, that presented by the greatest number of shareholders, without prejudice to applicable regulations governing gender balance.
Should one or more standing auditors taken from the list that had obtained the greatest number of votes (the `Majority Auditors') stand down during the year, where possible, the alternate auditor from the same list will replace him, without prejudice to applicable regulations governing gender balance. Where proceeding as above is not possible, the Meeting must be called in order to integrate the Board with the ordinary majorities and methods, in accordance with article 2401, paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, as an exception to the list voting system previously specified, respecting applicable regulations governing gender balance. Should one or more standing auditors taken from the list that had obtained the second greatest number of votes (the `Minority Auditors') stand down during the year, where possible, the alternate auditor from the same list will replace him, always in compliance with applicable regulations governing gender balance. Where proceeding as above is not possible, the Meeting must be called in order to integrate the Board with the ordinary majorities and methods, in accordance with article 2401, paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, as an exception to the list voting system previously specified, and in order to respect, where possible, the principle of minority representation. The Meeting held to deliberate on the integration of the Board of Auditors shall proceed in any case with the appointment or replacement of the members of said Board, without prejudice to the need to ensure that the structure of the Board of Auditors complies with the provisions of law and current regulations, and with the Issuer's Articles of Association .

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

46

Without prejudice to that set out by the previous paragraph, should the Meeting integrate the Board of Auditors, it shall resolve with ordinary majorities and methods, as an exception to the list voting system, which will only apply in the event of replacement of the entire Board of Auditors.
The Company's Board of Directors will propose to the Shareholders' Meeting, called to approve the 2019 financial statements, the approval of the amendments to the Articles of Association, aimed at ensuring that the statutory auditors to be elected are divided according to a criterion ensuring the gender balance, pursuant to the new art. 148, paragraph 1-bis of the Consolidated Financial Law, which states that "omisiss ... the least represented gender shall obtain at least two fifths of the effective members of the board of statutory auditors".

The delegated bodies have reported in a suitable and timely manner to the Board of Auditors concerning all activities performed, the general management trends and predictable evolution, as well as on the most important operations in terms of size and characteristics performed by the Issuer and its subsidiaries, specified by the Law and the Articles of Association , and therefore at least once a quarter.
In line with the Application Criterion 8.C.1 of the Self-Discipline Code, the Board of Auditors, at its meeting on 9th May 2017, the first after its appointment, verified the existence of the requirements of independence of its members, in accordance with the provisions in the Guideline 8. C.1 of the SelfDiscipline Code. The verification did not reveal any element that lead to the disappearance of this need for independence. During 2019, namely during the meeting of 4th March 2019, the Board of Auditors verified the continuation of the independence requirements for its members on March 14th 2018, and reported the outcome of these verifications to the Board of Directors. This verification was carried out also during the meeting of 24th January 2020.
***
During the fiscal year, in line with the Application Guideline 2.C.2 of the Self-Discipline Code, the members of the Board of Directors were adequately informed about the main legislative and regulatory developments affecting the industry in which the Issuer operates, as well as about the performance of the corporate bodies functions, through the divulgation of information during meetings and in the preboard report.
***
The Issuer specifies that any Auditor who, on his own behalf or that of third parties, holds an interest in a given Issuer operation, must inform the other auditors and the Chairman of the Board as to the nature, terms, origin and extent of such interest, in a full and timely manner.
The Board of Auditors in the conduct of its business, is regularly coordinates with the Head of Internal Auditing and with the control and risks Committee, in line with the Application Guidelines 8.C.4 and 8. C.5. of the Code.
15. RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SHAREHOLDERS
The Issuer has deemed of his interests - as well as a duty to the market - to set up a continuous dialogue from the time of listing, founded on reciprocal understanding of roles, with the general information of the shareholders. This dialogue will, in any case, take place in compliance with the procedure for the external communication of company documents and information. The article 2.2.3 subpar. 3 lett. k) of the Stock Exchange Regulations also states, with specific reference to companies intending to obtain listing of own shares with the 'STAR' qualification, the compulsory appointment of a professionally qualified person from within their organisational structure (Investor Relator) in charge of specifically managing relationships with investors.

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

50

Regarding the above, and in accordance with the recommendations of Principle 9 of the Self-discipline Code, the Company's Board of Directors appointed during the meeting held on 24th July 2006 Mr. Giacomo Bignucolo as Investor Relator and responsible for relationship with investors. Finally, Ascopiave has set up a specific `investor relations' section within its website (www.gruppoascopiave.it), in which information concerning the company and important for its shareholders is available.

16. MEETINGS

In accordance with Article 11.1 of the Issuer's Articles of Association , the subjects legitimated by the authorised intermediary may participate in the Meetings, in accordance with the current and relevant regulations. Any legitimated subject may be represented by another person, not necessarily a shareholder, upon presentation of a written proxy, in accordance with the current and relevant regulations. The proxy can also be assigned electronically, through the procedures envisaged by regulations currently in force. Moreover, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the summons notice, the electronic notification of the proxy can be sent by accessing the dedicated section of the Company's website, i.e. by sending the document to the certified email address of the Company (Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Company Articles of Association ). The regulations concerning Board activities, applicable to listed companies, have been considerably overhauled, following the coming into effect of Legislative Decree no. 27 dated 27th January 2010, the adoption of Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11th July 2007, on the exercise of certain shareholders' rights in listed companies (the so-called "Shareholders' Rights Directive" or "SHRD"). Now, therefore, the Shareholders' Extraordinary Meeting dated 28th April 2011 has resolved to integrate Article 11 of the Company Articles of Association by adding the paragraph 11.3 which envisages that the Company can appoint for each meeting an individual that may receive a proxy from those who have the right to vote with instructions on how to vote on each or some of the proposals on the agenda. In order to facilitate the Shareholders `participation to the Meetings, the Articles of Association also specifies that the Meeting may take place with interventions in different, separate and distant places that are audio/video connected, as long as formal meeting procedures and the principle of good faith and equal treatment of shareholders, are respected (Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association ).

***

With reference to the Criterion 9.C.3 of the Self-discipline Code, the Company's Ordinary Meeting

held on 5th July 2006 resolved to adopt the Meeting Regulations (subsequently amended by the

Meeting held on 28th April 2008 and by the Meeting held on 28th April 2011), which came into effect

as from the date of the Start of Negotiations(http://www.gruppoascopiave.it/investor-

relations/assemblee.pdf).

These Regulations are specifically aimed at governing

the Shareholders' Meetings, guaranteeing

a correct and orderly holding of such, and,

in particular, the right of each shareholder to intervene on the matters under discussion. It constitutes a

Report on Corporate Governance and Company Structure 2019

51

valid instrument by which to guarantee protection of all Shareholders' rights and the correct formation of the Meeting's will.
Among the other things, the Regulations provides that the Chairman shall lead the discussion, giving the floor to those who may legitimately intervene (i.e. those who have the right to participate in the meeting based on the law and Articles of Association ), who may have requested it. Those with a right to intervene who wish to speak, must request to do so of the Chairman, after his having read the item on the meeting agenda to which the request refers, and after discussion has been opened, before the Chairman declares discussion of the item over. The above mentioned request must be made by the raising of the hand, should the Chairman not have arranged for a written request procedure. Where procedure involves the raising of the hand, the Chairman will allow the person who has raised his hand first to speak. Should it be impossible to establish who raised his hand first, the Chairman will allow participants to speak in accordance with the order established by himself, in his own judgement. Where a written request procedure is implemented, the Chairman shall allow participants to speak based on the order of entry. The Chairman and/or, upon his invitation, the Directors and Auditors, regarding their respective functions or as the Chairman deems fit in relation to the meeting agenda, shall answer those legitimately able to participate, after each intervention, or rather after having completed al interventions on each item on the agenda, in accordance with what specified by the Chairman. Those who have the right to intervene, the Directors and Auditors, have the right to speak on each of the items on the agenda, and to formulate proposals to their regard. Those with a right to intervene can ask questions related to the matters in the agenda even before the meeting, through the procedures specified in the summon notice. The questions submitted prior to the Meeting by those with a right to intervene, are answered during the Meeting itself, provided that the requested information has been accessible according to the applicable regulations and as long as the Chairman is able to give a single answer to the questions concerning the same topic.
***
In light of the amendments to regulations concerning related party transactions pursuant to the Regulations adopted by Consob with resolution no. 17221 on 12th March 2010 (and further amendments) and taken into consideration the new regulations introduced by Legislative Decree. no.27/2010 implementing the Directive 2007/36/EC (the so-called "Shareholders' Rights Directive", the Shareholders' Meeting held on 28th April 2011 has resolved to integrate the Company Articles of Association by adding a new article recorded as "Related party transactions". This regulation gives the Board of Directors the possibility to approve the transactions of greater relevance within the scope of the Board of Directors as well as to implement the transactions of greater relevance within the scope of the Shareholders' Meeting, despite a contrary opinion of the Independent Directors, provided that the shareholders meeting authorizes and approves the transaction's execution and the Shareholder's Meeting itself takes its resolutions both based on the legal majorities and on the favourable vote of the majority of unrelated voting shareholders and provided that the unrelated shareholders present at the Shareholders `Meeting represent at least 10% of the share capital with voting rights. .

The Board has reported back to the Meeting on the activity performed and planned, and has acted to ensure that Shareholders are suitably informed as to all elements necessary in order to make a knowledgeable decision. 2 (two) directors attended the ordinary and extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 23rd April 2019 while the other directors justified their absence. The methods applied by the Compensation Committee Department for exercising its functions were presented to the shareholders, during the meeting of 23rd April 2019, on the Report on Compensation and during the discussion of its contents.
During the fiscal year 2019, the Issuer believed there have been no significant changes to the capitalisation of the Issuer market or to the structure of its subsidiaries that would require changes to be made by the Shareholders' Meeting to the Articles of Association , in relation to the percentages specified for the year of the prerogatives protecting minorities. To this regard, we would specify that in applying Article 144 quarter of the Consob Issuer Regulations 11971/1999 for the presentation of lists for the appointment of members of the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors, Articles 15.2 and 22.2 of the Issuer's Articles of Association requires a percentage threshold of 2.5% of the share capital with voting rights, or other percentage that may be specified or stated by provisions of law or regulations.
The Shareholders' Meeting of Ascopiave S.p.A. of 23rd April 2019, in extraordinary session, modified art. 6 of Ascopiave's Articles of Association in order to introduce the mechanism for increasing the voting right, pursuant to art. 127-quinquies of the Consolidated Financial Law.
The Regulations for the increased vote and the related request form for the registration in the special list for the increased vote are available on Ascopiave website at www.gruppoascopiave.it, "Corporate Governance" Section - "Increased Vote".
For further information on the increased vote, please refer to the paragraph "Securities conferring special rights".

OF ASCOPIAVE S.P.A.
(pursuant to Article 153 of Legislative Decree 58/1998 and Article 2429, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code)
Dear Shareholders,
the Board of Statutory Auditors, pursuant to Article 153 of Legislative Decree 58/1998 (TUF / Consolidated Law on Finance) and Article 2429, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code, is called on to report to the Shareholders' Meeting on the supervisory activities carried out by it as well as on any omissions and improper events it may have detected. The Board of Statutory Auditors can also make comments and proposals regarding the financial statements, their approval and other matters within its jurisdiction.
During the year, the supervisory tasks, attributed to the Board of Statutory Auditors by the applicable provisions of law and regulations, were carried out.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 2403 of the Civil Code ("Duties of Statutory Auditors"), the Board of Statutory Auditors has performed its duties by supervising compliance with the law and the Articles of Association, compliance with the principles of correct administration and in particular, the adequacy and proper functioning of the organizational, administrative and accounting system adopted by the Company.
The task of the statutory audit of the accounts pursuant to Article 14 of Legislative Decree 39/2010 has been assigned to the external auditing company Pricewaterhouse Coopers S.p.A. (PWC).
During the financial year ended 31st December 2019, we carried out the supervisory activities required by law, according to the rules of conduct for the Board of Statutory Auditors recommended by the National Council of Chartered Accountants and Accounting Experts.
With regard to the activities carried out during the year, also in compliance with the indications provided by CONSOB communication DEM / 102SS64 of 6th April, 2001, its subsequent amendments and additions, and with the indications contained in the Code of Conduct, we report the following:
1) The Board of Statutory Auditors supervised compliance with the law and the articles of association by respecting the periodicity provided for in Article 23, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Association. We obtained information from the Directors on the activities and on the main operations approved from an economic, financial and equity viewpoint, which were implemented by the Company, its subsidiaries and associates, during the year. In this regard, we can reasonably affirm that these operations comply with the law and the Articles of Association and that they are not manifestly imprudent, risky or in conflict with the resolutions passed by the corporate bodies or such as to compromise the integrity of the company's equity. Furthermore, from the information provided by the Directors to us, in accordance with the law, no operations carried out by them are deemed to be in conflict with the interests of the Company.
2) We assessed as complete the information provided by the Board of Directors in the management report, with regard to atypical and / or unusual transactions, including intra-group transactions and transactions with related parties. The Board of Statutory Auditors also assessed the information provided by the Board of Directors in the notes to the financial statements relating to intercompany and related party transactions, of an ordinary nature, and we believe these transactions to be congruous and in the Company's interests.
3) The external auditors PWC S.p.A., have released the reports pursuant to Articles 14 and 16 of Legislative Decree 39/2010, regarding the separate financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of the

During this first phase, interested operators submitted expressions of interest and non-binding offers, all of which were collected by 15th April 2019. Over twenty operators were contacted to participate in the selection process. At the end of the selection process, a partnership was started with HERA Group and on 17th June 2019, ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. and HERA S.p.A. approved the signing of a binding Term Sheet for the development of a leading company within the territories of the North-East with over one million energy customers. At the same time, they agreed to a reorganization of their respective gas distribution activities.
The Term Sheet, finalized in a framework agreement by the deadline of 31st July 2019, defined the perimeters involved, the economic terms of the agreement, as well as the related governance elements.

The framework agreement was signed on 30th July 2019, and from that date, all "Signing to Closing" activities have been carried out. On 19th December 2019, as communicated to the market, the partnership between HERA Group and ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. was finalized and became operational. in the commercial energy sector, with Ascopiave consolidating its Venetian leadership in gas distribution. The operation sanctioned the birth, through the company EstEnergy S.p.A., of the largest energy operator in the North-East and ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. acquired new assets in the distribution of gas, strengthening its position in the sector and reaching 775,000 managed users. All the commercial activities of the Ascopiave Group were concentrated in EstEnergy S.p.A., through the sale of the equity investments held in the subsidiaries Ascotrade S.p.A., Ascopiave Energie S.p.A., Blue Meta S.p.A., of the joint ventures Asm Set S.r.l. and Etra Energia S.r.l. and the investment in Sinergie Italiane S.r.l., valued at a total of 474,200 million Euros. ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. accounted for the disposal of these companies by recording a net result from discontinued operations / assets held for sale of  503,384 thousand, referring for  474,598 thousand to the capital gain generated by the disposal of the companies, net of costs incurred and the related tax effect, and for  28,786 thousand to dividends collected in the period. Therefore, at the end of the partnership process, EstEnergy S.p.A. share capital is held for 52% by HERA Group and 48% by ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. (which purchased its stake at a price of 395.9 million euros, based on an equity value of 100% of EstEnergy S.p.A. equal to 824.9 million euros). In line with the Shareholders' Agreement signed, in the composition of the Board of Directors of EstEnergy S.p.A., made up of five members, the appointment of two directors, including the Chairman, as well as the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors was reserved to ASCOPIAVE S.p.A.. As part of the transaction, for a period of seven years, ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. was granted the option of withdrawal, exercisable annually, at an exercise price equal to the higher of (i) the fair market value of the investment calculated at exercise date and (ii) the value of the investment, revalued for an annual interest of 4%, net of the share of dividends received, and in any case, not less than the value of the investment itself. As regards the reorganization of the gas distribution activities, ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. acquired from HERA Group, for a price of 168 million Euros, a perimeter of concessions comprising approximately 188,000 users located in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, which were conferred from 31st December 2019, into the newly established company called Ap Reti Gas Nord-Est Srl . With this operation, the Ascopiave Group reached the milestone of managing around 775,000 users and over 12,000 kilometers of network, consolidating its national ranking. Finally, as required by the agreement signed at the end of July 2019 ASCOPIAVE S.p.A. purchased 3% of the capital of Hera Comm S.r.l., at a price of 54 million Euros and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Nicola Cecconato was appointed to the company's Board of Directors. Finally, Hera Comm S.r.l. directly acquired 100% of the capital of Amgas Blu, a company wholly owned by ASCOPIAVE S.p.A., active in the province of Foggia with around 50,000 customers at a price of  42.5 million. 21) The Board of Statutory Auditors has also received analytical information on the impairment test performed by the auditing firm EY S.p.A. confirming the values of goodwill and some high-value financial assets entered in the balance sheet. The related details have been provided by the Board of Directors in the financial statements and are consistent with international accounting principles and Consob guidelines.
The Board of Statutory Auditors is not aware of other facts or elements that are relevant and / or worthy of being brought to the attention of the Shareholders' Meeting.
In consideration of the above, on the basis of the control activity carried out during the year, there are no impediments to the approval of the financial statements at 31st December 2019 and to the proposal of the Board of Directors, with regard to the destination of the result of the fiscal period.

Independent auditor's report
in accordance with article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 27 January 2010 and article 10 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014
To the shareholders of Ascopiave SpA
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ascopiave Group (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2019, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2019, and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report. We are independent of Ascopiave SpA (the Company) pursuant to the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian law. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters Recoverability of Goodwill

Auditing procedures performed in response to key audit matters

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements "Goodwill"

As of 31 December 2019, the Ascopiave Group recorded a goodwill amounting to Euro 47,914 thousand, representing 4% of total assets, partly referred to the major value resulted from the transfer of the gas distribution networks carried out by shareholders and partly referred to the consideration paid at the time of acquisition of some company branches belonging to the business of gas distribution.
We focused on this item of the financial statements since the assessment of the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the cash generating units represented by the distribution of gas ("Gas distribution") implies a high degree of evaluation and judgment as it requires Company management to use assumptions and a certain level of discretion in developing the evaluation model.

Our audit procedures concerned the recoverability of the goodwill value and were performed by carrying out the following tests:
- We performed an understanding and evaluation of the methodology adopted by the company's management to test the recoverability of the values allocated to the two cash generating units for the distribution of gas ("Gas distribution").
- Procedures were furthermore carried out in order to obtain audit evidence on the estimation of cash flow projections and on the data included in the business plans for the period 2020-2022, also with reference to the various scenarios assumed for the valuation of the cash generating unit "Gas distribution".

The valuation of the recoverable amount of the

-

cash generating units has been carried out by the

Company management using the discounted cash

flow method ("DCF"), discounting at a rate

representing the cost of capital the operating cash

flows generated by cash generating units, as per the 2020­2022 business plan, and the terminal

value assessed on the basis of the estimate of a

permanent sustainable profitability forecasted on

the expected profitability for the year 2022.

In particular, it should be noted that the current sectorial legislation provides that the natural gas

distribution service is awarded according to

bidding procedures to be carried out with a

predefined timing. Since the renewal of the

concessions has a certain degree of uncertainty, with reference to the valuation of the cash

generating unit "Gas distribution" the Company management assumed two alternative scenarios:

a) Obtainment of the renewal of all the concessions and assignments in place as at 31 December 2019 in 2022;
b) Termination of the gas distribution service in

Discussions were held with the Company management in order to understand and examine the business strategies and a critical analysis was performed on the most significant assumptions that underlie the new industrial plan, also using sector references and comparisons between the previous years' budgeted and final results.
Experts from the PwC network have been involved to conduct a critical examination of the model used and the calculation of the Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and of the expected long-term growth rate (g) used in the test development.
An independent sensitivity analysis was developed on the WACC and g rates applied for the determination of the recoverable values of the two cash generating units, recalculating the recovery values through rates that differ by half a percentage point compared to

2022, realizing a reimbursement value of the plants in concession regime pursuant to art.15 of the Legislative Decree n°164/2000.

Auditing procedures performed in response to key audit matters
those used.
- We tested the correct determination of the assets and liabilities book value attributed to each cash generating unit, including the allocated goodwill, to compare it with the recoverable amount.

- Finally, the completeness and correctness of the disclosure in the financial statements has been evaluated, taking into consideration the applicable financial statement framework.

Extraordinary operations

Note 4 to the financial statements "Share interests"

- The acquisition by AcegasApsAmga SpA of AP

Also thanks to the support granted by the PwC network experts, we:
- Conducted interviews with the Company management in order to understand and analyze this extraordinary operation through the analysis of the agreements signed between the parties;
- Analyzed the assessments made by the management in determining the transaction pursuant to the provisions of IFRS 5 as for discontinued operations, IFRS 3 as for business combinations, IAS 28 as for Investments in associates and IFRS 9 as for minor investments and the put options;

The 100% acquisition of AP Reti Gas Nord Est Srl has been recorded pursuant to IFRS 3 "Business combinations". As a result of the above acquisition, at 31 December 2019 the Group posted a goodwill temporarily amounting to Euro 14.140 thousand. The acquisition of 48% of EstEnergy SpA and of Hera Comm Nord Est Srl have been recorded pursuant to IAS 28 "Investments in associates" and to IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments", respectively.

Prior to entering this operation in the company accounts, management had to:

- Recognize and measure the acquired assets and liabilities and determine the goodwill, if any, resulting from the transaction in compliance with IFRS 3;
- Assess the need to set out financial assets in the financial statements resulting from possible contractual terms including put options on the investments held in EstEnergy SpA and Hera Comm Srl.

Given its significance, the economic and financial effects on the Group financial statements and its complexity, the transaction represented a key issue in the audit of the consolidated financial statements.

Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05 and, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriate application of the going concern basis of accounting, and for disclosing matters related to going concern. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate Ascopiave SpA or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The board of statutory auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, the Group's financial reporting process.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.

As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:

·

We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial

statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures

responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting

from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

·

We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design

audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;

·

We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

·

We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists

related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to

5 di 7

continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required

to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going

concern;

·

We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial

statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements

represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

·

We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the

entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated

financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of

the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated

financial statements.

We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

We also provided those charged with governance with a statement that we complied with the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable under Italian law and communicated with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determined those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We described these matters in our auditor's report.

Additional Disclosures required by Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014
On 23 April 2015, the shareholders of Ascopiave SpA in general meeting engaged us to perform the statutory audit of the Company's and consolidated financial statements for the years ending 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2023.
We declare that we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5, paragraph 1, of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 and that we remained independent of the Company in conducting the statutory audit.
We confirm that the opinion on the consolidated financial statements expressed in this report is consistent with the additional report to the board of statutory auditors, in its capacity as audit committee, prepared pursuant to article 11 of the aforementioned Regulation.

Independent auditor's report
in accordance with article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 27 January 2010 and article 10 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014
To the shareholders of Ascopiave SpA
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Ascopiave SpA (the Company), which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2019, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as of 31 December 2019, and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the regulations issued to implement article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 38/05.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of this report. We are independent of the Company pursuant to the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian law. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Recoverability of the investments' value

Note 3 to the financial statements "Share interests"

As of 31 December 2019 Ascopiave SpA recorded shareholdings totalling Euro 1.014.648 thousand, representing 87% of total assets.
We focused on this item of the financial statements since the assessment of the recoverability of the investments' value recorded in the financial statements implies a high degree of evaluation and judgment as it requires Company management to use assumptions and a certain level of discretion in developing the evaluation model.
The valuation of the recoverable amount of the investments has been carried out by the Company management using the discounted cash flow method ("DCF"), discounting at a rate representing the cost of capital the operating cash flows generated by the companies, as per the 2020-2022 business plan for each investee company, and the terminal value assessed on the basis of the estimate of a permanent sustainable profitability forecasted on the expected profitability for the year 2022.
In this respect, it should be noted that the current sectorial legislation provides that the natural gas distribution service is awarded according to bidding procedures to be carried out with a predefined timing. Since the renewal of the concessions has a certain degree of uncertainty, with reference to the valuation of companies belonging to the gas distribution sector, such as AP Reti Gas SpA, AP Reti Gas Rovigo Srl, Edigas Esercizio Distribuzione Gas SpA, AP Reti Gas Nord Est Srl and AP Reti Gas Vicenza SpA, the management assumed two alternative scenarios:
a) Obtainment of the renewal of all the concessions and assignments in place as at 31 December 2019 in 2022;
b) Termination of the gas distribution service in 2022, realizing a reimbursement value of the plants in concession regime pursuant to art.15

Our audit procedures concerned the recoverability of the investment's value and were performed by carrying out the following tests:
- We performed an understanding and evaluation of the methodology adopted by the company's management to test the recoverability of the investments' value for the subsidiaries belonging to the gas distribution.
- Procedures were furthermore carried out in order to obtain audit evidence on the estimation of cash flow projections and on the data included in the business plans for the period 2020-2022 used for each investment, also with reference to the various scenarios assumed for the valuation of those belonging to the gas distribution sector.
- Discussions were held with the Company management in order to understand the business strategies and a critical analysis was performed on the most significant assumptions that underlie the new industrial plans, also using sector references and comparisons between the previous years' budgeted and final results.
- Experts from the PwC network have been involved to conduct a critical examination of the model used and the calculation of the Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the expected longterm growth rate (g) used in the test development.
- An independent sensitivity analysis was developed on the WACC and g rates applied for the determination of the recoverable values of the investments,

Extraordinary operations

Note 3 to the financial statements "Share interests"
In 2019 the Ascopiave Group signed a trade agreement for the development of a partnership with the Hera Group consisting, in short, of the following operations:
- The sale to Hera SpA of the total investment (49%) held in EstEnergy SpA, which has approved a share capital increase in favor of the new shareholders Hera SpA and Hera Comm Srl;
- The sale to EstEnergy SpA of the total investment held by the parent company Ascopiave SpA in the trade companies: Ascotrade SpA - Ascopiave Energie SpA - Blue Meta SpA - Etra Energia Srl - Asm Set Srl Sinergie Italiane Srl in liquidazione;
- The sale to Hera Comm Srl of the total investment held by the parent company Ascopiave SpA in Amgas Blu Srl;
- The subsequent reacquisition of 48% of the new EstEnergy SpA which, in the meantime, has also acquired the entire investment of Hera Comm Srl in Hera Comm Nord Est Srl (previously Energia Base Trieste Srl); the latter, in turn, has been transferred by Hera Comm Srl the business unit relating to the sale of electricity, natural gas and value-added services called "Ramo Clienti Veneto HC ";
- The acquisition by AcegasApsAmga SpA of AP Reti Gas Nord Est Srl, acquirer of the business unit of AcegasApsAmga SpA relating to the gas distribution service in the

Also thanks to the support granted by the PwC network experts, we:
- Conducted interviews with the Company management in order to understand and analyze this extraordinary operation through the analysis of the agreements signed between the parties;
- Analyzed the assessments made by the Directors in determining the transaction pursuant to the provisions of IFRS 5 as for discontinued operations, IAS 28 as for Investments in associates and IFRS 9 as for minor investments and the put options;
- Analyzed the fair assessment of sale and acquisition prices in compliance with the underlying agreements and the reasonableness of the assessments made by the Company management not to carry the financial asset resulting from the related agreements;
- Analyzed the new shareholders agreements regulating the governance of EstEnergy SpA in order to confirm the assessment made by the management as concerns the actual loss of common control in the company;

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED NON FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 3, PARAGRAPH 10, OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE NO. 254/2016 AND ARTICLE 5 OF CONSOB REGULATION NO. 20267 OF JANUARY 2018
YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Independent auditor's report on the consolidated nonfinancial statement
pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 and article 5 of CONSOB Regulation No. 20267 of January 2018
To the Board of Directors of Ascopiave S.p.A.
Pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree No. 254 of 30 December 2016 (the "Decree") and article 5 of CONSOB Regulation No. 20267/2018, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on the consolidated non-financial statement of Ascopiave S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (hereafter the "Group") for the year ended 31 December 2019 prepared in accordance with article 4 of the Decree, presented in a specific section of the Report on Management, and approved by the Board of Directors on 13 March 2020 (hereafter the "NFS").
Responsibility of the Directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors for the NFS
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with article 3 and 4 of the Decree, with the "GRI-Sustainability Reporting Standards" defined in 2016 (hereafter the "GRI Standards") and, limited to some indicators, with the "G4 Sector Disclosure ­ Electric Utilities" defined in 2013 (hereafter "G4 Sector Disclosure"), indicated at paragraph "Comment on the methods adopted" of the NFS, identified by them as the reporting standards.
The Directors are responsible, in accordance with the law, for the implementation of internal controls necessary to ensure that the NFS is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or unintentional errors.
Moreover, the Directors are responsible for identifying the content of the NFS, within the matters mentioned in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group and to the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Group's activities, its performance, its results and related impacts.
Finally, the Directors are responsible for defining the business and organisational model of the Group and, with reference to the matters identified and reported in the NFS, for the policies adopted by the Group and for the identification and management of risks generated and/or faced by the Group.
The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, compliance with the Decree.

Auditor's Independence and Quality Control
We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italy 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations.

Auditor's responsibilities

We are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the compliance of the NFS with the Decree, with the GRI Standards and, limited to some indicators, with the G4 Sector Disclosure. We conducted our engagement in accordance with "International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) ­ Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information" (hereafter "ISAE 3000 Revised"), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised ("reasonable assurance engagement") and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain evidence considered useful.

In particular, we performed the following procedures:

1.

analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and

characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process

used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standards adopted;

2.

analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to

assess their compliance with the Decree;

3.

comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with that reported in Ascopiave

Group's Consolidated Financial Statements;

4.

understanding of the following matters:

- business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;

- policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;

- main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree.

With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below;

2 of 3

5.

understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the

significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held

meetings and interviews with the management of Ascopiave S.p.A. and with the personnel of

AP Reti Gas S.p.A. and we performed limited analysis of documentary evidence, to gather

information about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing

and submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the

preparation of the NFS.

Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:

- at holding level,

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with available evidence;
b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the information;

- for the subsidiary AP Reti Gas S.p.A., which was selected on the basis of its activities, its contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and its location, we carried out site visits during which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators.

Conclusions
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of Ascopiave Group as of 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree, with the GRI Standards and, limited to some indicators, with the "G4 Sector Disclosure ­ Electric Utilities", indicated at paragraph "Comment on the methods adopted".
