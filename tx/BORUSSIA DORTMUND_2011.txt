LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,

The 2010/2011 fiscal year that we are reporting on now was marked by an amazing, practically breathtaking development on the sporting front. At the end of the 2010/2011 National League season, Borussia Dortmund had claimed the German football championship. Considering that BVB's personnel expenses for the team are merely average for the National League, this can rightly and fairly be called a sensation.
It is also pleasing to note that the economic development of the company Borussia Dortmund has been able to keep the pace with the sporting development. The increased annual profit provides an indicator for the furious fiscal year, driven by sharply increased sales.
When you consider these numbers with the background that the financial fruits of the excellent sporting work will not be harvested for Borussia

Dortmund from the participation in the lucrative Champions League until the 2011/2012 fiscal year, you can predict that our company is developing on a sustainable path for long-term success.
Borussia Dortmund will continue to follow its solid strategy in the ongoing fiscal year and not make any paradigm changes. We will continue to adhere to the philosophy of forming and developing world-class young players and the guideline of striving for a maximum of sporting success without taking on new loans.
Our appeal to you, dear shareholders, is that you do not overload our young team and Borussia Dortmund with exaggerated expectations in the light of the sporting successes they achieved. We are well equipped for the future, but we have not forgotten the difficult situation in which our company found itself just a few years ago.

Hans-Joachim Watzke Managing Director (Chairman)

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

In the completed 2010/2011 fiscal year Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA achieved almost the best possible sporting success by winning the German championship and the direct qualification for the group phase of the UEFA Champions League associated with that. The most impressive thing here was the type and manner of this unplanned and unexpected success. One of the youngest, if not the youngest, Bundesliga (top German football league) teams of all time showed breathtakingly beautiful attacking football and took the hearts of supporters all over the country "by storm". The emotion and intensity of this success was demonstrated impressively by the 400,000 people who attended the championship celebrations on the 15th May 2011. This sporting history success was also reflected in the company results status for the 2010/2011 fiscal year, which the supervisory board assessed as being positive all round. In this context the supervisory board were particularly pleased to see an increase in the share price.
SUPERVISORY BOARD ACTIVITY, MEETINGS
In the fiscal year of 2010/2011 the supervisory board concerned itself intensively with the status and development of the company and the group. In doing so it performed its duties and exercised its rights pursuant to the law and by articles of the company without limitation.
Four supervisory board meetings took place in the 2010/2011 fiscal year (on the 9th September 2010, 30th November 2010, 23rd February 2011 and 20th June 2011) and one constitutive supervisory board session (on the 30th November 2011). As the supervisory board only has six members it did not set up any committees; all deliberations and resolutions were made in the plenum of the supervisory board. There are no procedures about the frequency of participation of the members in the meetings that have

to be reported. Resolutions were adopted in compliance with the provisions in the articles of the company and the law.
During the reporting period the supervisory board were kept up to date in a timely and comprehensive manner verbally and in writing by the management in the sense of § 90 of the German Stock Companies Act (AktG). In doing so the main topics were the course of business, the liquidity, revenue and financial situation, company planning (in particular financial, investment and HR planning), the risk situation and company and group risk management in both company and group and strategic topics. The supervisory board was also kept informed between its meetings by means of written documents. The financial reports during the year (i. e. six month financial report and quarterly financial reports) were also subjects of the information and also the subsequent discussion and review. The chair of the supervisory board also had regular contact with the management between the meetings; he received information about the current developments in the business outlook and significant business events in an ongoing manner. The supervisory board is convinced that the management fulfilled its duties to provide the information in a complete, continuous and timely manner.
The general partner and its managing director were advised and monitored by the supervisory board during the management of the company. The basis for doing so was the reports from the management and the questioning and discussion in the supervisory board. The supervisory board considered the legality and the orderliness of the management of the company, the efficacy of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system, the capacity of the company organisation and its operating efficiency. The reports and consulting also included questions about the development in sport.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

Furthermore, the supervisory board concerned itself with the financial accounting for the 2009/2010 fiscal year as well as the preparation of the shareholders' meeting in the previous year. In doing so the independence of the auditor was checked before the supervisory board decided on its candidate. Furthermore, the supervisory board concerned itself with the order conditions and the commissioning of the auditor elected in the previous year's shareholders' meeting.
ANNUAL AND GROUP REPORT 2010/2011
The annual report for Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA and the group report on the 30th June 2011 as well as the management report for the company and the group management report (which include respectively the discussions on the information pursuant to § 289 Par. 4 and/or § 315 Par. 4 of the German Commercial Code [HGB]) prepared and presented in a timely manner by the management were audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Dortmund, which was commissioned as the auditor, with inclusion of the bookkeeping pursuant to legal provisions and furnished in each case with an unreserved audit opinion. With regard to the existing early recognition system for risks, the auditor found that the management took the measures required pursuant to § 91 Par. 2 AktG in an appropriate manner and that the monitoring system is suitable for recognising developments which may endanger the survival of the company in an early manner.
The annual report and group report as well as the management report for the company and the group management report with the risk report and the corresponding audit reports were presented to all members of the supervisory board in a timely manner. These were discussed, explained and reviewed in de-

tail together with the management in the presence of the auditor by the supervisory board in its meeting on the 14th September 2011. In doing so the auditor reported on the significant results of its audits, and also those regarding internal control and the risk management system with regard to the financial accounting process and explained them. The auditor and the management answered questions asked by the supervisory board.
The supervisory board adopted the result of the audit by the auditor and did not raise any objections after the final result of its own audits. In its meeting on the 14th September 2011 the supervisory board approved both the annual report of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA from the 30th June 2011 and also the group report on the 30th June 2011.
Besides this the report compiled by the general partner pursuant to § 312 AktG about the relationships with affiliated companies (dependency report) for the 2010/2011 fiscal year was also the subject of a separate audit by the supervisory board. The dependency report was also audited by the auditor and furnished with the following audit opinion:
,,Having conducted a proper audit and appraisal we confirm that
1. the factual information in the report is correct, 2. the benefits offered by the company were not
unreasonably high for the legal transactions listed in the report."
The audit report of the auditor on the dependency report was also presented to the supervisory board. These documents were explained and audited by the supervisory board at its above-mentioned meeting with the auditor and the management. After the final result of its audit the supervisory board did not raise any objections against the declaration by the

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

general partner at the end of the dependency report. The supervisory board took note of the result of the audit of the dependency report by the auditor with approval.
The supervisory board suggests to the shareholders' meeting that the annual report from the 30th June 2011 should be adopted. In its meeting on the 14th September 2011 the supervisory board also explained and reviewed the profit distribution proposal of the general partner, taking into account the shareholders' interests and the status of the company, namely its financial and capital structure; in doing so the supervisory board put the proposal to the management at the shareholder meeting, that they resolve to post the accumulated profits of EUR 2,921,768.61 declared in the 2010/2011 fiscal year in other retained earnings. Furthermore, the supervisory board proposes that the general partner, Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH, is discharged for the 2010/2011 fiscal year.

PERSONAL INFORMATION
At the end of the shareholders' meeting on the 30th November 2010 Mr Othmar Freiherr von Diemar and Mr Ruedi Baer resigned from the supervisory board. Messrs Gerd Pieper, Harald Heinze, Christian Kullman, Bernd Geske, Friedrich Merz and Peer Steinbrück were elected to the supervisory board at the shareholders' meeting on the 30th November 2010. In its constitutive meeting on the 30th November 2010 subsequent to the shareholders' meeting the supervisory board then re-elected Mr Gerd Pieper as its chair and Mr Harald Heinze as his deputy respectively.
The supervisory board thanks the management, the advisory board and all employees for their great level of commitment and successfully performed work. A warm thank you also to Borussia Dortmund's business partners, limited partners and fans for their trust.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The supervisory board and the management of the general partner also concerned themselves with the topic of corporate governance during the reporting period. The supervisory board also examined the efficiency of its work, namely the frequency of its meetings, their preparation and execution and also the supply of information. The current Compliance Statement was adopted at the same time as the resolution making on the report at hand and takes into account the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version dated 26th May 2010. The complete declaration can be permanently accessed on the internet at http://eng.borussia-aktie.de, under the heading "Corporate Governance". There are additional descriptions and explanations about this pursuant to Figure 3.10 of the Code in a separate section of the Company Report (Corporate Governance Report).

BVB-SHARES

SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE

During the reporting period for financial year 2010/2011 (1 July 2010 ­ 30 June 2011), the performance of BVB-shares was influenced primarily by the extremely good season, which started with participation at the group stage of the UEFA Europa League and ended with the team becoming the 2010/2011 German champion. The ensuing financial boost extended to nearly all revenue areas. As a result, the shares trended significantly upward to reach the EUR 3.00 mark for the first time in five years (unless otherwise indicated, the following share price data is based on the closing share price of BVB-shares in XETRA trading; where necessary, figures have been rounded up to the nearest second decimal place).
The shares of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien started the new 2010/2011 financial year at EUR 1.05 on 1 July 2010 and did not fall below this level during the entire reporting period. At the beginning of August, the share price began rising slowly, driven by initial euphoria at the start of the season as season ticket sales set a new all-time record and the team won its opening game in the DFB-Cup. On 2 August 2010, BVB-shares were listed at EUR 1.06 and on 19 August 2010 at EUR 1.14. On 20 August 2010, the Company announced the provisional figures for the 2009/2010 financial year (see ad hoc disclosure dated 20 August 2010). The shares traded at EUR 1.15 on that date, at which level they remained until mid-September 2010 when the sustained winning streak in the Bundesliga ­ including a 3:1 away win against FC Schalke 04 ­ and the club's qualification for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League pushed the share price significantly upward. On 20 September 2010, BVB-shares were quoted at EUR 1.12, on 28 September at EUR 1.30 and on 30 September 2010 at EUR 1.38. The share price rose further in October on the back of additional Bundesliga victories. On the evening of 15 October 2010, Borussia Dortmund regained the top spot in the Bundesliga table for the first time in seven

years. BVB-shares climbed to EUR 1.56 on the next trading day (18 October 2010). This marked the start of a remarkable upward trend for the shares during the reporting period. Driven by victory after victory, the shares were quoted at EUR 1.82 on 21 October 2010, and on 8 November 2010 they broke the EUR 2.00 barrier for the first time in more than three years to close at EUR 2.09. The upward trend continued unabated. The shares listed at EUR 2.45 on 9 November 2010, EUR 2.63 on 10 November 2010, and EUR 2.70 on 12 November 2010. After the team consolidated the top spot in the league table following match day 12, the share price responded by breaking the EUR 3.00 barrier for the first time in more than five years to list at EUR 3.36 on 15 November 2010. On 16 November 2010, the shares reached their reporting season high at a closing price of EUR 3.43, boosted by positive Company financial news such as the net profit generated in the first quarter of financial year 2010/2011 (see ad hoc disclosure of 12 November 2010). Although the club continued winning in the Bundesliga, from that point on the share price was significantly impacted by profit taking, which resulted in a volatile showing with high trading volumes. BVB-shares traded at EUR 3.12 on 17 November 2010, EUR 3.30 on 19 November 2010, EUR 2.93 on 23 November 2010, EUR 3.30 on 26 November 2010 and EUR 3.06 on 29 November 2010. On 30 November 2010 ­ the date of the General Shareholders' Meeting ­ the share price was quoted at EUR 2.97. After Borussia Dortmund clinched the "Autumn Championship" in the 2010/2011 Bundesliga season, the share subsequently trended downward due to further profit taking, as is typical in the market at year end. On 3 December 2010 the share price was EUR 2.86, on 7 December 2010 EUR 2.46 and on 9 December 2010 EUR 2.36 before rising again amidst expectations of winning the final game in Seville on 15 December 2010 and advancing to the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa League 2010/2011. On 13 December 2010, BVB-shares were listed at EUR 2.59,

on 14 December 2010 at EUR 2.75 and on 15 December 2010 at EUR 2.84. On 16 December 2010, after the team failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa League following the draw in the game against FC Sevilla on 15 December 2010 in the last game of the group stage, the share price dropped to EUR 2.48, at which level it remained until the end of 2010. The price of BVB-shares held at that level until 30 December 2010 to close out the 2010 calendar year at EUR 2.55. They started the new

calendar year at EUR 2.63 on 3 January 2011. On 14 January 2011, the shares traded at EUR 2.75 prior to the start of the second half of the season with an away match in Leverkusen. After an impressive away win, BVB-shares rose to EUR 2.95 on the next trading day (17 January 2011) and reached EUR 3.04 on 21 January 2011. Despite profit taking, which resulted in a drop in the share price to EUR 2.88 on 27 January, BVB-shares stabilised in the following period thanks to continued club successes. The shares traded at

13

PIECE

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

EUR 2.80 on 25 February 2011, the date of publication of the semi-annual figures (see ad hoc disclosure of the same date). After another impressive away win at FC Bayern München, BVB-shares rose to EUR 2.99 on the next trading day (28 February 2011) and reached EUR 3.03 on 4 March 2011. However, the share prices moved downward in the following period due to renewed profit taking amidst high trading volumes. BVB-shares were quoted at EUR 2.90 on 11 March 2011, EUR 2.74 on 14 March 2011 and EUR 2.49 on 15 March 2011. At the end of March, however, the price recovered as the club's athletic success continued and it strengthened its hold on the top of the table. The shares traded at EUR 2.76 on 31 March 2011, EUR 2.89 on 4 April 2011 and EUR 3.01 on 20 April 2011. The price was at EUR 3.10 on 30 April 2011, the last trading day before the weekend on which the

team had the chance to finally clinch the German championship. After Borussia Dortmund did in fact assure itself of the championship through a 2:0 win against 1. FC Nürnberg, profit taking again led to a volatile price trend amidst heavy trading. BVB-shares thus traded at EUR 2.86 on 2 May 2011, the first trading day after clinching the German championship, and at EUR 2.67 and then EUR 2.52 on the next two days. The shares were quoted at EUR 2.43 on 13 May 2011, the date of publication of the figures for the third quarter of financial year 2010/2011 (see ad hoc disclosure of the same date). By 18 May 2011 the price had fallen to EUR 2.09. The shares then made a notable recovery to list at EUR 2.59 on 1 June 2011 and EUR 2.48 on 15 June 2011, the price at which the BVB-shares closed the eventful 2010/2011 financial year on 30 June 2011.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Clearly structured and implemented Corporate Governance is very important at Borussia Dortmund. It represents responsible and transparent term company management and control oriented to longterm added value. Efficient cooperation between management and Supervisory Board, respect of the shareholders' interest, openness and transparency

of corporate communication are key aspect of good corporate governance. This is a key issue for the management of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH as general partner of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA ("Group") and the advisory board of the group.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. KGaA

The statutory framework of Corporate Governance is regulated by the German Corporate Law. According to § 161 AktG (German Companies Act), executive committee and Supervisory Board of a public company are obliged to declare once every year whether and in how far the recommendations of the "Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code" in the German Corporate Governance Codex ("Codex") published in the official part of the electronic Federal Gazette were observed (with reference to the past) and are observed (with reference to the future); in case recommendations are not followed, § 161 (1) first clause AktG (German Companies Law) stipulates that an explanation is made with regard to the reasons.
As a rule, the Codex is reviewed once annually and amended as required. It contains basic statutory provisions on the management and supervision of German listed companies based on internationally and nationally recognised standards for good and responsible corporate governance. It aims to make the

German system of corporate governance transparent and understandable in an effort to boost the confidence of international and national investors, customers, employees and the general public in the management and supervision at German listed companies.
Many of the Codex's recommendations ("should" provisions) are tailored exclusively to stock corporations and are at most applicable by analogy to partnerships limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaften auf Aktien, "KGaA"), i.e. to our Company.
A KGaA is a hybrid corporate form combining elements of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) and a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft). It is a separate legal entity whose share capital is divided into shares which are held by at least one shareholder (the general partner) that has unlimited liability as against creditors of the Company and limited partners (Kommanditaktionäre) that are not personally liable for the debts of the Company (§ 278 (1) AktG ­ German Companies Act).

16

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The key differences between a KGaA and a German stock corporation can be characterized as follows:
· Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA has no Management Board. Instead the general partner, Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH, is solely responsible for its management and representation. This company in turn is represented by one or more managing directors; its sole shareholder is Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund.
· The rights and duties of the Supervisory Board appointed by the General Shareholders' Meeting of the KGaA are limited. Specifically, it has no authority to appoint and dismiss managing directors at Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH or regulate the terms of their contracts. Nor does the Supervisory Board have authority to adopt rules of procedures for the general partner or a catalogue of business transactions requiring its approval. Rather, such rights and duties are vested in the governing bodies of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH, namely its Advisory Board and the Executive Committee created by the Advisory Board.
· Additional distinctions exist with respect to the General Shareholders' Meeting of the KGaA, which are primarily controlled by § 285 and 286 (1) AktG (German Company Law) and the statutes of our company.
Consequently, the management of the general partner and the Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA are required to provide a

Compliance Statement (Entsprechenserklärung) pursuant to § 161 AktG (German Company Law), taking into account the organisational distinctions of the legal form of a KGaA and their configuration in the Articles of Association. The Compliance Statement must be made permanently accessible to the shareholders on the website of the company. This is done on our investor relations website at http://eng.borussia-aktie.de, category "Corporate Governance (CG)". The Compliance Statement made in 2011 is also printed in the appendix of this Corporate Governance Report.
This Corporate Governance Report of our company will be published in the annual report for the financial year 2010/2011 which will be published on our investor relations website at http://eng.borussiaaktie.de, category "Publications".
Transparency
Our company informs the limited partners and shareholder associations, financial analysts and the interested public regularly as to the company's condition and any material changes in its business.
On our website, we publish in particular ad hoc information, corporate new as well as the directors' dealings information, shareholder structure, the currently valid statutes and the financial calendar we have received. A summarising overview as to the company's important publications in the fiscal year 2010/2011 is also provided in the "Annual Document" according to § 10 WpPG (Securities Prospectus Act) which is also entered on our website http://eng.borussia-aktie.de in the category "Corporate Governance (CG)".

The financial calendar includes the company's key dates and can also be viewed at http://eng.borussiaaktie.de, category "Financial Calendar".
The financial statement press conference on the "preliminary" figures of the previous fiscal year will be ­ as in the previous years ­ shown in real time via live stream on the internet and can be followed by the interested public.

Publication of analysts' recommendations and research studies on our website http://eng.borussiaaktie.de under the category "Capital Market View" also serves purpose of communication with market participants. In addition, extensive further information on the company is published on this website. Further information on the company for our customers and fans as well as the interested public is published on our website www.bvb.de.

The General Shareholders' Meeting in the previous year was held on 30 November 2010 in Dortmund in compliance with the relevant notice and form requirements for its convening. In compliance with the German Corporate Governance Codex, the reports and documents required by law were available; they were sent to the limited partners at their request and also published on the website of the company together with the agenda. The resolutions on all items of the agenda were made with approval in a range between 92.7% to 99.9% of the votes.
The next General Shareholders' Meeting of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA is scheduled for Monday, 21 November 2011 in Dortmund.
The financial reports in the course of the year will be published at the intervals recommended by the Codex. Our company provides detailed information on this by means of so-called "Preliminary Announcements". Compilation of the consolidated accounts and the interim financial reports follows the IFRS accounting standards. The annual results of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA have been drawn up in accordance with the HGB (German Commercial Code).
Following the suggestions of the Codex, the information has been made available on our website and also in English.

Compensation of the Managing Directors
The Executive Committee of the Advisory Board of the general partner and not the Supervisory Board of our company is responsible for determining the compensation of the members of the management. Compensation of the managing directors consists of two components: A fixed amount and a variable component. The fixed amount is defined in the contract and paid in twelve equally monthly rates. The variable part of the compensation depends on the course of business and is defined according to the net income before taxes and management compensation. Additionally granted non-cash and fringe benefits essentially include insurance benefits at normal market rates and provision of a company car. There are no stock option programmes or similar incentives. The compensation components provided are individually and in total adequate. The compensation of the members of the management are stated in total as well as itemised in the appendix of the annual statement and consolidated accounts.
Compensation of the Members of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board supervises the management. In our company, it consists of six members who are all appointed by the General Shareholders' Meeting. According to § 13 (1) of the statutes, the members of

18

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

the Supervisory Board receive exclusively a fixed and comparatively small compensation of annually  7,000; the chairman twice the amount and his deputy one and a half times the amount. The compensation of the members of the Supervisory Board is stated in the appendix of the consolidated accounts. With consideration of the easy calculability according to the above explanation, this information is not itemised but stated as a total sum. In the fiscal year 2010/2011 the company did not pay any other compensation or benefits to the members of the Supervisory Board.

Report on ownership of company shares by members of the company management and the Supervisory Board
By 30 June 2011, one member of the company management owned 4,545 registered shares of our company. The members of the Supervisory Board at the same time owned a total of 6,536,553 registered shares. The (total) ownership of shares by members of the company management and the Supervisory Board is 6,541,098 registered shares and thus more than 1% of the shares issued by Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA.

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD OF BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. KGaA PURSUANT TO §161 AktG DATED 14 SEPTEMBER 2011

The company management of the general partner (Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH) and the Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA declare pursuant to §161 AktG that for Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA since the last compliance statement dated 09 September 2010 the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Codex ("DCGK") in the version dated 26 May 2010 have been and are followed, apart from the following differences which are partly due to the organisational distinctions of the legal form of a KGaA and their configuration in the statutes of our company:
At Section 2.3.3 Clause 2: Support of the limited partners is not carried out in absentee ballot, because the statutes of the company do not provide permission for this type of voting procedure.
At Section 3.8 Paragraph 3: The D&O insurance does not provide for a deductible and it is not intended to change this, because changing in our understanding would not have any behaviour-guiding effect on members of the board nor would it be suitable as motivational aid.
At Section 4.2.1 Clause 2: The Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA does not have competence to appoint or discharge of managing directors at Borussia Dortmund GeschäftsführungsGmbH or regulate the terms of their contracts; this is executed by the Executive Committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH. Since January 2006, the management consists of Hans-Joachim Watzke (chair of the management) and Thomas Treß (managing director). Their business areas were sufficiently defined in the terms of their contracts;

furthermore, the managing directors execute their authorities in the sense of legal provisions and the provision of the statutes together in close cooperation; therefore the competent bodies of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführung-GmbH do not deem it necessary to prepare additional standing orders for the company management.
At Section 4.2.2 Paragraph 1: § 7 of the statutes of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA stipulates that the general partner has the right to compensation for the personnel and material costs incurred for management of the company plus remuneration of 3% of the otherwise generated annual surplus of the company. Compensation and the compensation system for the management of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH have been and are otherwise decided and revised regularly by the executive committee created there (difference to the competence of the Supervisory Board stipulated in Section 4.2.2 Paragraph 1 due to the legal form).
At Section 4.2.3 Paragraph 2 Clause 4 and paragraph 3 Clause 3: The executive committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH decides on the compensation structure of its managing directors without including negative developments for the configuration of variable compensation components of managing directors; also, retroactive change of the success objectives or of comparing parameters is not excluded. With regard to organisational distinctions of the legal form of a KGaA, the corresponding recommendations do not seem applicable nor are they regarded as sensible in this case.
At Section 4.2.3 Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 5: The Codex recommends for joint-stock companies that

20

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

they include so-called "compensation caps" for cases of premature termination of activity on the Supervisory Board without important reason in the contracts of the Supervisory Board or on the occasion of premature termination of activity on the Supervisory Board as a result of change of control. The executive committee has decided and will decide in the future in case of imminent (re-) appointments of managing directors of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH without making provisions in terms of so-called "compensation caps", because executive committee and managing directors do not regard the above recommendations with regard to the organisational distinctions of the legal form of a KGaA and their configuration in the statutes of the company.
At Section 4.2.3 Paragraph 6: The chairman of the Supervisory Board has not reported and will not report to the General Shareholders' Meeting on the basic outlines of the compensation system and its changes, because the Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA ­ as stated above ­ is not competent to appoint and dismiss managing directors of Borussia Dortmund GeschäftsführungsGmbH or for regulating the terms of their contracts. Furthermore, system information has been and will be provided in the paragraph "Compensation Report" of the annual report and individual information on compensation for managing directors in the appendix of the annual report and consolidated accounts; this is deemed sufficient.
At Section 4.3.4 Clause 3: Important businesses between the general partner and certain individuals close to it on the one hand with the company and on the other hand in the sense of §§ 89, 112 in connection with §§ 278 Paragraph 3, 283 No. 5 AktG (e.g. granting of loans) require cooperation of the Supervisory Board. In this sense the recommendation has been followed. Furthermore, the

Supervisory Board is not authorised to adopt a catalogue of business transactions requiring its approval for the general partner or its managing directors.
At Section 4.3.5: The Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA does not have competence to approve of additional activities of managing directors of the general partner as it has no competence to appoint or discharge of managing directors at Borussia Dortmund GeschäftsführungsGmbH or regulate the terms of their contracts; this is executed by the Executive Committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH.
At Section 5.1.2 Paragraph 1 Clauses 2 and 3: Longterm succession planning in our company is carried out by the managing directors and ­ since the Supervisory Board has no personnel competence ­ the executive committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH. The latter also ensures the "diversity" to be achieved when staffing the management. With regard to the number of two managing directors that are currently deemed sufficient for the company and whose positions have been filled for the foreseeable future, it does not seem feasible to aspire to an adequate consideration of women recommended by the authors of the Codex in the near future.
At Section 5.1.2 Paragraph 2 Clause 2: The executive committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH has decided and will decide on re-appointment of its managing directors in the absence of special circumstances as necessary before the end of one year or the end of the existing appointment. The orientation of the personnel decision towards an element of time and circumstance is not deemed sensible with regard to organisational distinctions of the legal form of a KGaA and the desire to implement a higher degree of flexibility.

21

BORUSSIA DORTMUND Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA

At Section 5.1.2 Paragraph 2 Clause 3: The age limit for managing directors of the general partner has been and will be decided by the executive committee of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH whenever (re-)appointments of managing directors are imminent without any general type of definition in this regard. Definition of an age limit is not deemed sensible.
At Section 5.2 Paragraph 2, 5.3.1 Clause 1, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3: Committees, especially and audit committee have not been and will not be installed by the Supervisory Board, because it is comprised of only six persons and decision-making committees must be comprised of three persons. The existing practice of treating all imminent topics in the full Supervisory Board will be maintained in the future. The practiced waiver of forming a nominating committee by the Supervisory Board recommended in the Codex applies accordingly. Furthermore, it is comprised only of representatives of the shareholders as required by the Codex for formation of the nominating committee.
At Section 5.4.1 Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3: Concrete objectives for its composition with consideration of specific topics described in the Codex with "Age Limit for Members of the Supervisory Board" and "Diversity" or "Adequate Participation of Women" have not been and will not be defined by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board holds the opinion that such restrictions with regard to other criteria for suggestions concerning election of members of the Supervisory Board are not appropriate; rather it wants to decide about its composition individually in any given concrete situation.
At Section 5.4.3 Clause 3: Candidate suggestions for the president of the Supervisory Board have not

and will not be published, because the Supervisory Board deems individual election of its members for sufficient and voting in the General Shareholders' Meeting in favour or against a candidate with regard to his position in the Supervisory Board not practicable.
At Section 5.4.6 Paragraph 2 Clause 1 and Paragraph 3 Clause 1 and 2: According to § 13 (1) of the statutes, the members of the Supervisory Board receive exclusively a fixed and comparatively small compensation of annually  7,000; the chairman twice the amount and his deputy one and a half times the amount. Information on the total compensation of the Supervisory Board in the Corporate Governance Report as well as in the appendix of the consolidated accounts have been and will be deemed sufficient.
At Section 5.5.3 Clause 1: It has been and will remain reserved not to follow the recommendation that the Supervisory Board in its report to the General Shareholders' Meeting should report on any conflicts of interest and their treatment. The principle of confidentiality of deliberations in the Supervisory Board (cf. § 116 Clause 2 AktG and Clause 3.5 Paragraph 1 Clause 2 of the Codex) has had and will have priority.
At Section 7.1.2 Clause 2: The recommendation to deliberate half-yearly and any quarterly financial reports between management and Supervisory Board before they are published has not been and will not be followed, because the objective of publication of financial reports in the course of the year immediately after they have been drawn up receives priority. However, deliberation and control of such financial reports is carried out by the Supervisory Board.

22

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

At Section 7.1.2 Clause 4: Financial reports in the course of the year have been and will be published within due time which in individual cases (i.e. for the half-yearly financial report, since it optionally undergoes a review by the auditor) may exceed 45 days from the end of the reporting period.

At Section 7.1.3: At Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH the scope of compensation for its managing directors do not include stock option programmes or similar stock-oriented incentives; therefore no concrete information has been and will be made in the Corporate Governance Report in this regard.

BUSINESS TREND AND FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS

LOOKING BACK ON FINANCIAL YEAR 2010/2011

The achievements of the 2010/2011 financial year, both athletically and from a business perspective, eclipsed even the boldest of hopes and expectations as Borussia Dortmund not only capped off the financial year by winning the German Football Championship but also reported a net profit of more than 9 million euros!
The biggest milestone of the past financial year was the culmination of the team's sensational athletic performance in winning the 2011 German Football Championship to make it the reigning Bundesliga champion for the seventh time in the history of Borussia Dortmund. The brilliant performance of Coach Jürgen Klopp's young team was applauded throughout the entire German football landscape, well beyond the circle of BVB sympathizers.
Borussia Dortmund has succeeded in putting together a fresh and enthusiastic team that is hungry for success, without having gone into financial debt to do so. This means that the Company will have the anticipated proceeds from the Champions League at its full disposal, as no loans were taken out on the road to the international competition that would have to be

serviced. Borussia Dortmund will continue to pursue its philosophy of developing first-class young players in the future as well.
One thing is certain: for young, ambitious players, Borussia Dortmund is the team to be on. This is demonstrated not only by the policy pursued jointly by the management and by sport director Michael Zorc of securing long-term relationships with key players, but also by the fact that five members of the German national team now come from Borussia Dortmund: Mats Hummels, Marcel Schmelzer, Kevin Großkreutz, Sven Bender and Mario Götze.
Borussia Dortmund will keep this paradigm in place. Transfer income and expenses are again balanced for the current season. The personnel budget for licensed players has been raised to meet the coming challenges of the Champions League.
The trend in sponsoring proceeds has been extraordinarily good, and by selling 53,000 season tickets, Borussia Dortmund set a new record, both internally and for the entire Bundesliga.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN GERMAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL

Match attendance
As reported by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, a new attendance record was set in the 2010/2011 season with an average of 42,101 attendees at the 306 first-division matches. The increase of 0.7% on the previous season allowed the 42,000 mark to be broken for the first time ever. The previous record was 41,905 attendees per match, set in the 2008/2009 season.
Apart from winning the German championship, Borussia Dortmund led the pack in attendance figures as well with 78,416 spectators per game to fill the stadium at 97.23% capacity.
Bundesliga TV marketing
According to a statement made by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH on 20 June 2011, the League Association has taken a crucial step with respect to marketing Bundesliga media rights. The German Federal Cartel Office informed DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH that it may continue to pursue its proven practice of centralised marketing based on the Federal Cartel Office's initial assessment following a comprehensive market survey and an analysis of the concepts submitted for the distribution of media rights. Accordingly, a call for tenders may be put out for a distribution option involving an early highlight report on Saturdays on the Internet and for smart phones as an alternative to a scenario involving an early free TV report. In the opinion of the Federal Cartel Office, it is important that the bidding process be transparent and discrimination-free, particularly with regard to the packaging of the rights. In the coming weeks, DFL will design the call for tenders in close cooperation with the Federal Cartel Office to include at least two distribution scenarios aimed at encouraging competition. The call for tenders is expected to be put out at the end of 2011.

BVB total
Borussia Dortmund is now in the television business too. Since January 2011, Borussia Dortmund has been the first Bundesliga team to offer its own TV package in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom. In addition to all of Borussia Dortmund's official matches, "BVB Total" includes reports, current news and a look behind the scenes. All BVB Bundesliga matches are broadcast live, and matches in other competitions are available via delayed streaming. "BVB Total" can be seen on Deutsche Telekom's "Liga Total!" platform, which is part of its "Entertain" product.
Like other teams, Borussia Dortmund has already been offering interviews and match highlights via the internet. However, this is the first time that a team is using its own TV channel as a marketing tool in Germany.
UEFA club licensing
In its regulations on club licensing and financial fair play (2010 version), UEFA has defined the rights, obligations and responsibilities of all parties involved in the UEFA club licensing procedure and described the requirements that a club must fulfil to obtain a license entitling it to take part in UEFA club competitions.
The measures introduced as part of UEFA's new regulations on club licensing and financial fair play are intended to encourage clubs to manage their finances better and to strike a sustainable balance between income, expenses and investments. The most important factor in receiving future permission to play from UEFA is the break-even requirement, which will take effect at the end of the 2012 reporting year, be reviewed during the 2013/2014 European Cup season and result in sanctions in cases of non-adherence.

25

BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund

International competitions
After eleven years, the Bundesliga has recaptured the right to have four teams in the Champions League. Thanks to the successes of German teams in international competitions, Germany has secured third place in the UEFA five-year rankings behind England and Spain. The third-place spot guarantees three fixed slots in the European premier league, with the fourth-ranked Bundesliga team able to play its way in to the Champions League. However, this will not affect the coming season. Not until the 2012/2013 season will Germany be able to send

four teams to the Champions League. The German premier league last sent four clubs to this lucrative European competition in the 2001/2002 season.
Germany's advance has come at the expense of Italy's Serie A, which the Bundesliga has pushed back from third to fourth place in the UEFA five-year rankings. Since the 2006/2007 season ­ which was weak from a German perspective ­ will no longer be included in the rankings as of the start of the coming season, the Bundesliga is currently in second place in interim scoring for 2011/2012, just ahead of Spain.

GROUP STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

In addition to its core activities of playing football and marketing SIGNAL IDUNA PARK, Borussia Dortmund has established football-related lines of business. At present, the Company holds direct and indirect interests in the following companies: BVB Stadionmanagement GmbH (100.00%), BVB Stadion Holding GmbH (100.00%), Sports & Bytes GmbH

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

SPORTS MANAGEMENT
Although our successful restructuring has led to financially stable results, in the future we will nonetheless continue to focus on achieving success on the field under a cost-optimised budget. To accomplish this objective, Borussia Dortmund will continue to put together a competitive team in the future with an emphasis on young, promising players.
Our sporting objectives will be aligned with our financial circumstances, meaning that the makeup of the squad and its cost structure will continue to depend on calculable variables on the income side. Qualifying for and successfully participating in international competitions would provide the financial flexibility for additionally reinforcing the squad. Our medium-term goal must therefore be for the team to establish a presence in European competitions.

The operating result ­ which at Borussia Dortmund refers to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) ­ is a key indicator for measuring success. For this reason, we constantly monitor our segments' operating results using monthly comparisons of budgeted and actual situations. To optimize the operating result, the main factors to leverage are sales revenues, which can be additionally improved in the major revenue categories of ticketing, sponsorship, TV marketing and merchandising, and operating expenses, which can be lowered through disciplined management.
In the coming years we will concentrate on generating steady sales growth while limiting operating expenditure. The decisive factor in this respect will be qualifying for international competitions.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
A key goal of the management of Borussia Dortmund is to achieve a lasting increase in profitability along with bolstering its financial strength. In addition to steadily improving the operating result, the generation of positive cash flows is therefore the most important financial objective of our Company. We seek to optimise cash flows by concentrating on the "operating result" and "investments" as impacting factors.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The capital management responsibilities of the Company's management involve stabilising and increasing the equity of Borussia Dortmund as calculated in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). One of the main ways in which we will reach these objectives is by improving the operating result and making effective investments.

CORPORATE STRATEGY

Borussia Dortmund continues to pursue its mediumterm goal of re-establishing itself as one of the leading football clubs in the Bundesliga. After having successfully reorganised the Company, restructured our financial liabilities and made investments in our professional squad, we consider ourselves to be on the right path. As the first and thus far only German listed football company, we have expanded our financial base by

exclusively marketing the rights to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK, using the "Borussia Dortmund" brand more effectively and establishing football-related lines of business. However, professional football with its classic revenue sources of TV marketing, sponsorship, ticketing and merchandising will remain the Group's core business in future. Borussia Dortmund is confident that it will be able to further stabilise and expand its position for the following reasons:

30

MANAGEMENT REPORT

· Borussia Dortmund is in sporting terms one of the most successful, well known and popular German football clubs with an outstanding fan base that gives it one of the highest average spectator numbers in Europe.
· A football company can only be financially successful if it enjoys sporting success over the long term. In order to make its financial performance less dependent on short-term sporting success in the future, Borussia Dortmund will continue to push ahead with marketing its brand name both nationally and internationally.
· Germany continues to be Europe's largest football market, although it lags behind certain other European markets in financial terms. This means that Germany has major growth potential.
All financial activities of Borussia Dortmund are geared toward the target groups relevant to a football club: its fans, members and business partners. Products and services should be tailored to these groups as closely as possible. Borussia Dortmund intends to use the brand potential at its disposal to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities inherent in professional club football at an international level.
Its current business strategy can principally be summarised as follows: · Sustainably adjusting athletic prospects · Intensifying the promotion of up and coming
talent · Increasing fan involvement · Taking advantage of the "Borussia Dortmund"
brand

ments and decisions must under certain circumstances be postponed to the extent these would only be possible by incurring new debt. Moreover, a player might be sold based on financial considerations in cases where this would not have happened had the decision been made purely on the basis of sporting criteria.
Thus a conflict arises between the pursuit of financial interests and sporting interests, i.e. a situation in which sporting considerations and financial considerations may be at odds with each other, particularly if the club continually falls short of its sporting goals. In such cases, management weighs the opportunities and risks to find a solution that does adequate justice to the Company's strategic objectives.
Sponsorship plays a key role in this context. Over the years, sponsorship has grown to become one of the Company's largest revenue categories. In contrast to central TV marketing, where distribution is already clearly defined in advance, Company management is itself able to determine the requirements for and direction of sponsoring activities and, if necessary, change the strategy implemented as circumstances change. The key figures for the sponsoring segment have already been budgeted for the coming years based on commitments from SIGNAL IDUNA (until 2016) and Evonik Industries AG (until 2013), the Company's chief partners.
Revenues from international competitions are more difficult to budget for, since they depend solely on the team's athletic performance.

However, financial performance and the business trend are largely dependent on sporting success. Since sporting success is very difficult to plan, the best that management can do is to create a good foundation for success. Investments, particularly in the professional squad, are therefore a necessary prerequisite for achieving sporting objectives such as qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. However, in order to meet financial objectives, planned invest-

Another key strategic management parameter is transfer income. It must be decided whether to sell sought-after players or to retain them to pursue greater athletic goals over the long term.
Achieving positive operating results and making the investments that depend on such results, mainly in the professional squad, should enable cash flows to stabilise at a positive level on a lasting basis.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This past season was one of the most successful financial years ever for Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien (Borussia Dortmund) , not only in terms of athletic success but also from a business perspective. Demand for the Borussia Dortmund brand has increased even more thanks to the team's winning the German championship, playing in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League and, most of all, the likeability and genuine nature of the players and their enthusiasm for football. During the reporting period (1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011), the Company generated sales of

EUR 136,402 thousand (previous year: EUR 100,889 thousand) and gross sales of EUR 140,541 thousand, a rise of EUR 37,207 thousand on the previous financial year.
Borussia Dortmund ended the financial year with a net profit of EUR 9,539 thousand under HGB, an improvement of EUR 12,326 thousand.
The result from operating activities (EBIT) increased by EUR 13,440 thousand on the prior year to EUR 12,426 thousand in 2010/2011. .

BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund

The performance of the individual sales items is described in the following:
Income from match operations
Income from match operations amounted to EUR 27,679 thousand, an increase of EUR 4,280 thousand on the prior year.
With an average attendance of 78,416 to put SIGNAL IDUNA PARK at 97% capacity throughout the season, Borussia Dortmund again increased revenue from Bundesliga ticket sales, which rose by EUR 1,714 thousand year on year to EUR 23,502 thousand. Borussia Dortmund thus made a major contribution to the Bundesliga's new attendance record. The 18 Bundesliga teams welcomed an average of 42,101 attendees per home game to 306 games for the highest spectator numbers in the history of the football league. Borussia Dortmund's leading position in the market is not only due to the success enjoyed in the past season but also to our loyal fans and the unique atmosphere at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
Borussia Dortmund generated proceeds from international ticket sales of EUR 3,350 thousand based on participation in the UEFA Europa League and the four home games this involved. In the previous year, Borussia Dortmund did not play in any international competitions after having failed to qualify on the last day of play. Match operations generated an additional EUR 827 thousand from friendly matches, the two away games in the DFB-Cup and matches played by the regional league team.
Income from advertising
Sponsorship income increased by EUR 11,090 thousand year on year to EUR 49,939 thousand, again making this the main sales item of Borussia Dortmund in financial year 2010/2011. Sales from sponsorship constitutes approximately 36.6% of total sales.
In addition to our main sponsor, Evonik Industries AG, SIGNAL IDUNA, which owns the naming rights for the "nicest stadium" in the world, and equipment supplier Kappa Deutschland GmbH, other renowned companies acting as Champion Partners for Borussia Dortmund were the Radeberger Group,

SEAT Deutschland GmbH, Sparda Bank Münster eG and SPREHE Geflügel- u. Tiefkühlfeinkost Handels GmbH & Co. KG. For the coming financial year, we have acquired even more prominent companies as Champion Partners. At the end of the 2010/2011 season, the hospitality areas of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK ­ the "regulars' table" level, the business club, Borussia Park and the "Rote Erde Club" ­ were at 94% capacity, up from 90% in 2009/2010. Also quite popular among companies were our "incentives packages" ­ offers for business clients wishing to invite guests to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK for specific games only. Demand for the local derby, and particularly for the last game of the season, was so immense that Borussia Dortmund had to set up an additional hospitality area under a tent in order to satisfy most of the requests for space. In June 2011 it already was clear that capacity of 100% would be possible even before the new Bundesliga season started.
Advertising income also included the bonuses associated with qualifying for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, winning the German championship and accordingly qualifying for the 2011/2012 UEFA Champions League.
Income from media exploitation rights and joint marketing
Income from TV marketing increased to EUR 32,094 thousand in the financial year just ended, a rise of EUR 11,003 thousand compared to financial year 2009/2010. Income from national TV marketing rose by EUR 6,579 thousand to EUR 26,775 thousand based on the club's top ranking at the end of the season and No. 2 spot in the weighted four-year rankings.
Television income of EUR 4,944 thousand was generated from participation in international competition (qualifying round and subsequent group stage). Starting at the group stage, UEFA is in charge of TV marketing of the UEFA Europa League, which in addition to the market pool includes fixed and performance-based bonuses as well as match bonuses from centralised marketing. In the qualifying round, the television rights may still be offered decentrally on the market.

34

MANAGEMENT REPORT

An additional EUR 375 thousand was generated based on participation in two DFB-Cup matches and membership of the U23 team in the regional league.
Transfer income
At EUR 12,995 thousand, transfer income exceeded the previous year's figure by EUR 8,063 thousand.
In the financial year under review, Nuri Sahin was transferred along with Nelson Valdez, Tamas Hajnal and Markus Feulner. The transfer income reported in 2009/2010 came primarily from the transfer of Alexander Frei to FC Basel.
Retail, conference, catering and other income
Borussia Dortmund registered an additional increase in sales in the areas of retail, conference, catering and other income, which increased by EUR 1,077

thousand between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011 to reach EUR 13,695 thousand.
The breakdown of sales by division is as follows: Catering improved by 3.66% to EUR 9,035 thousand, primarily thanks to the four additional home games due to participation in the UEFA Europa League at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
Rental and lease income, advance booking fees and other ticketing fees increased by EUR 713 thousand over the prior-year figure to EUR 4,511 thousand.
Other operating income improved by EUR 1,694 thousand as compared to the previous reporting period to EUR 4,139 thousand, mainly as a result of inclusion of professional squad members Bender, Götze, Großkreutz, Hummels and Schmelzer on the German national team.

CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES

Staff costs
Staff costs amounted to EUR 57,388 thousand in 2010/2011, up from EUR 44,578 thousand in the previous year. Staff costs for the professional squad increased by EUR 12,018 thousand over the prioryear figure to EUR 49,471 thousand. In addition to the increase in the professional squad budget, which was planned in advance, bonus payments correlating with the team's success on the field played a large part in the rise in staff costs. However, staff costs also increased by approximately EUR 1,888 thousand in the retail and administrative areas as a result of the championship bonuses, though also due to establishment of a marketing department and increasing our employee base to enable us to handle forthcoming projects and meet rising demand for services. By contrast, staff costs for other match operations, which include the U23 team and the U19 junior team, decreased by EUR 1,096 thousand due in part to relegation of the U23 team to the regional league.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment rose by

EUR 284 thousand to EUR 10,623 thousand in the reporting period. Intangible assets were the main factor in the increase.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses amounted to EUR 60,104 thousand in the reporting period compared with EUR 49,431 thousand in the previous year.
Apart from the increase in match operations of EUR 3,526 thousand due to the additional organisation of international games and travel to away matches abroad, the greatest increase in other operating expenses related to advertising expenses, including marketing agency fees, which rose by EUR 3,359 thousand, and transfer expenses (primarily writedowns of carrying amounts), which rose by EUR 2,431 thousand.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs amounted to EUR 401 thousand in 2010/2011, down from EUR 1,644 thousand in the prior year.

FINANCIAL POSITION

ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE
After taking into account the net profit for the year, Borussia Dortmund had equity in the amount of EUR 98,533 thousand as at 30 June 2011. This corresponds to an equity ratio of 47.08%.

ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
In financial year 2010/2011 Borussia Dortmund invested EUR 8,630 thousand in intangible assets, nearly all of which was attributable to investments in the player base.

Liabilities fell by EUR 3,138 thousand as against the figures at the end of last year's reporting period. The decrease was broken down as follows:
Trade payables increased by EUR 1,552 thousand, and liabilities to affiliates rose by EUR 1,432 thousand.
Financial liabilities decreased by EUR 10,025 due to scheduled repayments as well as a significant reduction in drawings on credit lines.
Other liabilities increased by a further EUR 3,903 thousand as of the balance sheet date as a result of wage and tax liabilities not yet due.

Cash payments for property, plant and equipment during the same period amounted to EUR 2,131 thousand and included fixtures for the Brackel training centre, among other things.
ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY
As at 30 June 2011, Borussia Dortmund held cash of EUR 697 thousand, none of which was subject to restrictions.
The Group had access to an additional EUR 10,000 thousand in overdraft facilities as at the reporting date, EUR 2,246 thousand of which had been drawn down as at the end of the reporting period.
Proceeds from the sale of player registrations amounted to EUR 3,159 thousand in the past financial year. Payments for investments in the professional squad amounted to EUR 8,622 thousand.

NET ASSETS

Total assets of Borussia Dortmund increased from EUR 201,310 thousand to EUR 209,288 thousand. The increase resulted mainly from the rise in trade

receivables, which had grown by EUR 10,684 thousand as at the reporting date. This increase was offset in part by the decrease in fixed assets.

36

MANAGEMENT REPORT

OVERALL SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE

Borussia Dortmund ended the financial year with a net profit of EUR 9,539 thousand, a year-on-year improvement of EUR 12,326 thousand.
The equity ratio is stable and, taking into account the net profit for the year, amounts to 47.08%. As at

30 June 2011, Borussia Dortmund held cash of EUR 697 thousand, none of which was subject to restrictions. The Group had access to an additional EUR 10,000 thousand in overdraft facilities as at the reporting date, EUR 2,246 thousand of which had been drawn down as at 30 June 2011.

REMUNERATION REPORT

The structure of the management remuneration system is determined and regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Advisory Board. The Executive Committee of the Advisory Board of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH is also responsible for determining the remuneration of management in detail and setting the appropriate amount of remuneration. The principal criteria for determining the appropriate amount of remuneration are the responsibilities of the particular member of management, his personal performance and the financial situation, profits and future prospects of Borussia Dortmund .
Management remuneration comprises two components: a fixed amount and a variable component. The fixed remuneration component is stipulated by contract and is paid out in twelve equal monthly instalments. The variable remuneration component is based on the business trend and is dependent on net profit for the year before tax and the managing

directors' remuneration. Any additional non-cash or ancillary benefits granted relate primarily to insurance benefits at standard market conditions and provision of a company car. The Group does not offer any stock option plans or similar incentive plans. The remuneration components provided are reasonable both in and of themselves and taken as a whole.
Remuneration of the Supervisory Board is governed by § 13 of the Articles of Association, pursuant to which each member of the Supervisory Board receives fixed remuneration amounting to EUR 7 thousand; the Chairman receives twice that amount and the Deputy Chairman one and a half times that amount. Value added tax is reimbursed to the members of the Supervisory Board.
The disclosures required by § 285 No. 9 of the HGB are included in the notes to the financial statements.

OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT

The divisions of Borussia Dortmund are exposed to a wide variety of risks that are inseparably linked to the conduct of business. A functioning control and monitoring system is essential to the early identification and assessment of and systematic response to these risks. It is the responsibility of the Group's internal risk management system to monitor and control such potential risks.
The risk management system is based on principles and guidelines laid out by the management. These principles and guidelines are designed to facilitate the early identification of any irregularities so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. In order to ensure the highest possible level of transparency, risk management has been incorporated into the organisational structure of the Group as a whole. All departments and divisions are required to immediately report any market-relevant changes in the risk portfolio to the management. The risk management system is also an integral component of the overarching planning, steering and reporting process.

This year, the risk inventory procedure implemented with the objective of cataloguing and assessing all risks has again proven effective as a management tool. Risks are identified, discussed and reviewed in consideration of current circumstances in one-onone meetings or plenary sessions in order to assess the current likelihood of their occurring and the extent of the losses they might entail. In so doing, particular emphasis is placed on high priority risks that could significantly jeopardise the ability of the Borussia Dortmund Group to continue as a going concern. Thus the organisational groundwork has been laid to enable the Group to identify any changes to the risk situation that may emerge early on.
Regular risk reports to the governing bodies of Borussia Dortmund keep them informed of the Group's current risk profile, enabling them to monitor and manage risk.

THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS

The key features of the accounting process-related internal control and risk management system employed by Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KG can be described as follows:
· Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KG distinguishes itself through its clear organisational and corporate structures as well as its control and monitoring structures;

· the internal control and risk management systems as they relate to the accounting process form an integral part of operational and strategic planning processes;
· responsibilities have been clearly assigned in all areas of the accounting process (such as financial accounting and management cost accounting);
· reporting is carried out in monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual intervals, whereby a distinction

38

MANAGEMENT REPORT

is made between matters requiring immediate action by the Company and those involving Company strategy; · the computer systems used in accounting are protected from unauthorised access; · an adequate system of internal guidelines has been established and is updated as needed; · the departments involved in the accounting process fulfil quantitative and qualitative requirements; · the completeness and accuracy of the accounting data is checked regularly by reviewing samples and conducting plausibility tests, both manually and by means of software employed for this purpose; · the principle of dual control is adhered to at all points in the Group's accounting-related processes;

· the management receives reports at scheduled intervals throughout the process or more frequently if necessary;
· the Supervisory Board deals with the key accounting issues, risk management and the audit engagement, among other things.
The accounting process-related internal control and risk management system, the key features of which are described above, ensures that transactions can be correctly recorded, prepared and accounted for in the financial statements.

SPECIFIC RISKS

STRATEGIC RISK
The economic trend of a football company depends on its athletic performance. However, this can only be planned to a certain extent, meaning that financial and corporate planning must be aimed at maintaining the profitability of the company ­ even in the face of setbacks ­ so as to avoid risks to the Company's future existence. Long-term affiliations and partnerships ensure a certain level of planning security, independently of sporting success. Moreover, it is important to reconcile the conflict between pursuing athletic objectives ­ including taking the measures necessary to achieve such objectives ­ and meeting financial requirements such as assuring adequate liquidity.
In addition, in order for its team to participate in Bundesliga matches Borussia Dortmund requires a licence, which is issued for each season by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH. Issue of this licence has a significant impact on the Company's financial position and financial performance by its very nature. As in previous years, Borussia Dortmund has been issued a licence for the coming season without any conditions or requirements.

PERSONNEL RISK
The importance of human resources to companies is growing. Thus personnel risk represents a central risk category in a company's risk management organisation.
The core business of Borussia Dortmund ­ participating in Bundesliga matches ­ is largely dependent on the Company's human resources. Athletic success, which forms the basis for economic success, is heavily dependent on the professional sports squad and the quality of the players. Intensive scouting and medical examinations are intended to help the Company avoid making ill-advised investments in signing new players. Absences of key players, for example due to injury, cannot be foreseen and, as a result, may jeopardise the ability of the Company to meet internally defined objectives.
Yet in the non-sports segments as well, the use of qualified specialists and executives is essential for the Group; thus it is important that the Company retain them over the long term.

39

BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund

MACROECONOMIC RISK
The trend in future funding through sponsorship is difficult to foresee. Borussia Dortmund has laid the groundwork for the coming years by entering into long-term contracts with major sponsors. Since many companies ­ primarily SMEs ­ are currently employing caution in waiting to see how the market will develop, we cannot yet reliably forecast whether last years' total volume in sponsorship can be achieved again this year.
Given current circumstances, it should be noted that it is impossible to plan and manage the risk of interruptions to match operations, for example due to outbreak of an epidemic. Nor is it possible to foresee the potential financial ramifications of such a situation.

COMPETITIVE RISK
The UEFA regulations on club licensing and financial fair play were adopted in May 2010. The regulations aim
· to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances
· to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues
· to protect the integrity and smooth running of competitions
· to encourage responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football clubs
· to ensure that clubs settle their liabilities punctually · to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of
European club football.

Borussia Dortmund has been subject to tax audits and audits by social security authorities in the past. Borussia Dortmund is of the opinion that its tax returns were submitted completely and correctly and that its social security contributions were paid in full and on time. However, should the tax or social security authorities view the situation differently due to a diverging assessment of the facts, it is possible that they could later make additional claims that could impact the Company's financial position and performance.

The process will be introduced gradually starting with the 2011/2012 season. Starting with the reports on liabilities and future financial information, the most important factor in receiving permission to play from UEFA in the future will be the break-even requirement, which will take effect at the end of the 2012 reporting year, be reviewed during the 2013/ 2014 European Cup season and result in sanctions in cases of non-adherence. The club monitoring procedure will be supervised by UEFA's Club Financial Control Panel, which may request additional information from the licence applicant and/or the licensing body at any time during this process.

40

MANAGEMENT REPORT

FINANCIAL RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK
Borussia Dortmund bears the financing risk related to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK. The Group is presently not subject to any interest rate risk thanks to the fixedinterest credit agreements entered into for the coming years.
Management has entered into interest rate swap transactions with German Landesbanken (i.e. banks local to Germany's individual states or "Länder") in order to lock in low interest rates over the medium to long term and hedge the risk of changes in cash flows due to changing interest rates.
CREDIT RISK
Borussia Dortmund conducts business exclusively with third parties of high credit standing. Credit risk may arise in the context of player transfers and long-term sponsorship agreements as well as from centralised marketing agreements.
One fixed-interest loan with a principal amount of EUR 20,000 thousand and which matures in June 2013 is subject to covenants with respect to the Group's equity ratio and interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) as stated in the consoli-

dated financial statements. In addition, covenants are in place in relation to an overdraft facility in the amount of EUR 5,000 thousand. These covenants relate to the equity ratio, net debt/EBITDA and the interest coverage ratio. The covenants are reviewed on an annual basis. As at the end of the reporting period, all covenants had been complied with.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable at any point in time to meet regular payment obligations on time and in the full amount.
Regular reporting and strict controls aimed at adherence to target figures, approved budgets and KPIs ensure that the Company's liquidity remains a transparent variable. Liquidity is constantly monitored through liquidity planning, which takes expected cash flows into consideration. As with any planning, an inherent risk exists in that current estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from the planning statements. However, there is a general risk that budgeted proceeds may not be realised due, for example, to agreements not being able to be honoured as entered into due to the poor economic climate and/or insolvency of the customer.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF RISK POSITION

With regard to the risks discussed in this report and the review of the overall risk position, no risks were identified in the financial year under review that would contribute to a permanent or material deterioration in the financial position or financial performance of either the Group or its individual companies.

A review of the risk position indicated that the aggregate total of the individual risks defined within the risk areas does not pose a threat to the ability of Borussia Dortmund to continue as a going concern.

Thanks to its risk management system, Borussia Dortmund is in a position to comply with the statutory provisions on control and transparency in the Company.

REPORT ON EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS

ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY

Borussia Dortmund capped off the past 2010/2011 season by winning the German championship and taking a firm grasp on the Bundesliga table following match day 34. The team's playing success, by virtue of which it qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League, has also increased its financial prospects in nearly all income areas.

Notwithstanding these new circumstances, Borussia Dortmund still intends to leverage its stable, robust equity base and continue to avoid incalculable financial risk in pursuing its athletic goals.

EXPECTED GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

In the 2011/2012 season the Bundesliga is anticipating being rewarded for its sustainable management and outstanding athletic performance: the Bundesliga has been promised the right to send a fourth team to the UEFA Champions League, the premiere league in European club football, starting in the 2012/2013 season.
Changes are also on the horizon in national cup competition. The German Football Association (DFB) is hoping to use its new strategy for marketing the DFB-Cup to generate additional sales for the clubs competing for the trophy starting in 2012. Contrary to the model practiced to date of offering the national cup matches and the international matches as a package, starting this year the call for tenders will go out for the DFB-Cup as a separate segment according to General Secretary Wolfgang Niersbach. At present, subscription broadcaster Sky as well as ARD and ZDF own the broadcasting rights, which generate approximately EUR 50 million for DFB. These are distributed among the 64 qualifying teams, depending on how well they place. The plan to market the

DFB-Cup separately is aimed at making the Cup competition more attractive for private free TV channels in addition to realizing opportunities for creating new marketing content. Telekom, which already reports on the Bundesliga under its "Liga total!" brand, could also be interested.
On 6 June 2011, DFB announced on its website that it would be conducting an open, transparent and discrimination-free bidding process for award of the audio-visual media rights to the men's DFB-Cup competition matches and the final match of the women's DFB-Cup competition in the Federal Republic of Germany. The call for tenders will apply to the four seasons from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. Companies interested in acquiring these rights were able to register with DFB until 21 June 2011.
In the area of ticket sales, Borussia Dortmund set a new season ticket league record by selling 53,000 tickets for the 2011/2012 season. The new "Vorwerk Lounge" in the southeast corner of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK also caters to rising demand for hospitality seats.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

EXPECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ANTICIPATED EARNINGS TREND
As in previous years, success on the field will be a major factor in determining our earnings trend. We have laid the foundation for generating additional sales from international competition by qualifying for participation in the UEFA Champions League.
The management assumes that in financial year 2011/2012 and the following financial year, a net profit will be reported in the single-entity financial statements of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA in addition to a consolidated net profit.
ANTICIPATED SALES TREND
Borussia Dortmund generated sales of EUR 136,402 thousand in the financial year just ended, an increase of EUR 35,513 thousand on the previous season.

ANTICIPATED TREND IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES
Strict cost controls enable the management to minimise other operating expenses and to identify and realise savings potentials.
However, the trend in operating expenses depends to a great extent on the number of official matches in a season, meaning that forecasting changes in this item always involves a prediction of athletic performance.
Staff costs will again remain on a level with those in the previous financial year, although Borussia Dortmund has been able to maintain the core team and even to strengthen it in some respects.

The income situation could be similar in the following year thanks to the team's qualification for the UEFA Champions League.

EXPECTED DIVIDENDS

Given the Company's current and non-current financial liabilities, which still amount to EUR 61,108 thousand, a dividend payment would not be appro-

priate until Borussia Dortmund has re-established itself on the international sporting scene and generated long-term, substantial profits.

PROJECTED FINANCIAL POSITION

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIALP LANNING
We are continuing to focus our investing activities on our professional squad and on additional measures to modernise SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
Thus, we will concentrate on the core business of Borussia Dortmund Group and, in so doing, will not be taking any financial risk that cannot be calculated in advance. In essence, this means that we will only be incurring capital expenditure to the extent permitted by our anticipated financial leeway. As part of capital expenditure planning, Borussia Dortmund

will thus not count on any uncertain sporting successes which, if they failed to materialise, would lead to substantial new debt.
ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY TREND
Repayments of the long-term loans to finance the stadium continue to be made on schedule. Moreover, Borussia Dortmund has been able to make substantial investments in strengthening the professional squad. Going forward, we will continue to use non-earmarked funds to strengthen the athletics department while ensuring that Borussia Dortmund remains solvent at all times.

OPPORTUNITIES

Borussia Dortmund's greatest opportunities lie in unlocking and exploiting additional sales potential by participating in international competitions such as the UEFA Champions League. In addition, an international presence would almost certainly have a positive impact on the merchandising business.
Further significant earnings potential would result from successful participation in the DFB-Cup, the

German cup competition. However, the financial benefits also depend, to a large extent, on which teams we are drawn against.
Moreover, the management is aware of the fact that Borussia Dortmund has high-quality young players on its squad who are greatly valued on the market and have a high transfer potential.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE

The past season exceeded even the boldest of expectations and put Borussia Dortmund in a position to reap the financial fruits of its success on a lasting basis. Media coverage of the team's participation in

the UEFA Champions League, the prestige of winning the championship and a likeability factor that cannot be put into numbers will also translate into financial benefits.

REPORT ON POST-BALANCE SHEET DATE EVENTS

Borussia Dortmund was pleased to welcome three new Champion Partners in July and August of 2011. Borussia Dortmund succeeded in acquiring Wilo, the world's leading high-tech pump manufacturer located in Dortmund, as a new Champion Partner. Wilo already has a tradition of involvement with Borussia Dortmund, as SIGNAL IDUNA PARK is fully equipped with Wilo products.

Borussia Dortmund then started the 2011/2012 Bundesliga season with a heated 3:1 win over Hamburger SV. The opening game of the current German champion was viewed by football fans in 199 countries all over the world. The season started well on the whole as the young team followed a 0:1 loss in their first away game at TSG Hoffenheim with a 2:0 victory against 1. FC Nürnberg on match day 3.

Borussia Dortmund's second new Champion partner is Yanmar, a manufacturer of industrial engines as well as agricultural and construction machinery headquartered in Osaka, Japan. This partnership is of particular interest to Yanmar owing to BVB professional Shinji Kagawa, whose football roots are with Cerezo Osaka, of which Yanmar has been the main sponsor for some time.

Participation in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League is yet another step for Borussia Dortmund on the way to international success. The drawing for the Champions League group stage held on 25 August 2011 in Monaco has provided the team with a challenge, having set it against some interesting and strong opponents in European professional football.

Another new Champion Partner of Borussia Dortmund is Q-Cells, a globally leading photovoltaics company.
After a good showing in the preseason (including beating out Mainz 05, Hamburger SV and Bayern München to win the T-Home Cup), Coach Jürgen Klopp's team started the regular season with a clear 3:0 win in the first round of the DFB-Cup at an away game against third-division team SV Sandhausen. For the following round in October, Borussia Dortmund drew a home game at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK against second-division team Dynamo Dresden.

Our Supervisory Board member Bernd Geske has once again increased his voting interest in Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA to the current 11.25%. As at 8 August 2011, the shareholder structure of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA was as follows:

Bernd Geske: BV. Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund: Free float:

OTHER DISCLOSURES

REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 289 (4) OF THE HGB

The following information has been provided by the Company in response to the requirements of § 289 (4) Nos. 1 to 9 of the HGB:
1. The share capital of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA amounts to EUR 61,425,000.00 and is divided into 61,425,000 no-par value ordinary bearer shares. All of the shares have been admitted to trading on the Regulated Market (General Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and to the over-the-counter markets (Open Market) in Berlin, Bremen, Stuttgart, Munich, Hamburg and Düsseldorf. Each no-par value share entitles the holder to one vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Company has only one class of shares, and all shares carry the same rights and obligations. All other rights and responsibilities attaching to the Company's shares are determined in accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, "AktG").
2. There are no restrictions affecting the voting rights or transfer of the shares.
3. Interests in the share capital of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA exceeding 10% of the voting rights as at 30 June 2011: Bernd Geske (10.63%)
4. There are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.
5. There is no control of voting rights in cases in which employees are shareholders.
6. Because of its legal form as a partnership limited by shares, Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA does not have a management board. Instead, management and representation of the Company is the responsibility of the general partner. The

provisions of § 6 No. 1 of the Articles of Association stipulate that Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH, with registered offices in Dortmund, is to act as such an executive body on a permanent basis and not for a limited period of time by virtue of its status as a shareholder. The appointment and removal of managing directors of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH is governed by § 8 No. 6 of its shareholders' agreement and is the responsibility of the Executive Committee of its Advisory Board, and therefore not of the Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA.
In principle, changes may be made to the Articles of Association of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA only by a resolution of its General Shareholders' Meeting, which, in accordance with § 133 (1) of the AktG, must be passed by a simple majority of votes and also, in accordance with § 15 No. 3 of the Articles of Association of the Company in conjunction with § 179 (1) and (2) of the AktG, by a simple majority of the capital represented on the date of the resolution, except to the extent that mandatory statutory provisions or the Articles of Association stipulate otherwise. A mandatory provision of statute requires that a resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting be passed by a majority of three-quarters of the share capital represented on the date of the resolution in the event of changes to the Articles of Association relating to the object of the Company (§ 179 (2) sentence 2 AktG), the issuance of non-voting preferred shares (§ 182 (1) sentence 2 AktG), capital increases involving the disapplication of pre-emptive subscription rights (§ 186 (3) AktG), the creation of conditional capital (§ 193 (1) AktG), the creation of authorised capital (§ 202 (2) AktG) ­ where appropriate with authorisation to disapply pre-emptive subscription rights (§ 203 (2) sentence 2 in conjunction

46

MANAGEMENT REPORT

with § 186 (3) AktG) ­, the ordinary or simplified reduction of share capital (§ 222 (1) sentence 2 and § 229 (3) AktG) or a change of legal form (§ 233 (2) and § 240 (1) of the German Reorganisation and Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz, "UmwG")). In addition, capital increases, other changes to the Articles of Association and other decisions of a fundamental nature may only be resolved with the approval of the general partner in accordance with § 285 (2) sentence 1 of the AktG. The Supervisory Board is authorised in accordance with § 12 No. 5 of the Articles of Association to resolve changes to the Articles of Association which relate only to the wording thereof, in particular in connection with the amount of capital increases from authorised and conditional capital.
7. The general partner is authorised until 29 November 2015, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital by a maximum of EUR 30,712,500.00 in total by issuing new no-par value ordinary bearer shares against cash and/or in-kind contributions on one or more occasions (Authorised Capital 2010). The limited liability shareholders have a statutory pre-emptive right over new shares issued by the Company. Such new shares may also be subscribed by a bank or a company in accordance with § 53 (1) Sentence 1 or § 53b (1) sentence 1 or (7) of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz, "KWG") if it agrees to offer them to the limited liability shareholders for subscription. However, the general partner is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to decide to disapply the statutory pre-emptive subscription rights of the limited liability shareholders. Pre-emptive subscription rights may be disapplied a) with respect to fractional amounts arising as a consequence of subscription ratios; b) in the event of capital increases against cash contributions up to a total amount of 10% of the share capital existing on the date of

registration of the Authorized Capital 2010 or, if lower, 10% of the share capital existing on the date of exercise of the authorisation (in each case taking into account any other authorisations made use of during the effective period of this authorisation for the disapplication of pre-emptive subscription rights pursuant to or through the corresponding application of § 186 (3) sentence 4 of the AktG), provided the issue amount of the new shares does not fall significantly below the market price; c) in the event of capital increases against inkind contributions, particularly for the purpose of acquiring companies, equity investments, real estate, rights and claims against the Company.
The general partner is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and the terms and conditions of the share issue.
In the event of a takeover bid for shares issued by the Company and admitted to trading on a regulated market, the general statutory responsibilities and powers apply to the general partner in other respects. For example, if a takeover bid were to be received, the general partner and the Supervisory Board would be required to issue and publish a response to the bid, giving their reasons, in accordance with § 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz, "WpÜG") to enable the limited liability shareholders to make a decision on the bid on an informed basis. Moreover, in accordance with § 33 of the WpÜG, once a takeover bid has been announced, the general partner may not take any actions outside the ordinary course of business that could frustrate the success of the bid, unless those actions have been authorised by the General Shareholders' Meeting, or the Supervisory Board has given its

47

BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund

approval of the actions or the actions relate to obtaining a competing bid. In making their decisions, the general partner and the Supervisory Board are bound to have regard to the interests of the Company, its employees and its shareholders. At the end of the reporting period, the Articles of Association did not contain any provisions within the meaning of §§ 33a ­ 33c of the WpÜG (European prohibition on frustrating action, European breakthrough rule, reservation of reciprocity).

8. The Company is not a party to any material agreements which are conditional on a change of control following a takeover bid for the issued shares of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA.
9. The Company is not a party to any compensation agreements that would apply in the event of a takeover bid.

STATEMENT BY THE GENERAL PARTNER ON RELATIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES

The Dependent Company Report prepared by Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA pursuant to § 312 of the AktG sets out the relations with Ballspielverein Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund as the controlling entity and its affiliated companies. The general partner ­ represented by its Managing Directors ­ has issued the following concluding declaration:

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

NOTES GENERAL DISCLOSURES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The annual financial statements of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA for the 2010/2011 financial year have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, "HGB") and the particular accounting requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, "AktG"). There is an additional obligation in accordance with § 315a (1) HGB to prepare consolidated financial statements applying international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.
The balance sheet classifications comply with the classification format under commercial law in accordance with § 266 HGB, while the income statement has been prepared in the vertical format using the nature of expense method in accordance with § 275 HGB. The additional information to be provided in accordance with the statutory requirements is presented in the notes for reasons of clarity and accessibility.
As a result of the fact that BV. Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund holds 100% of the shares in Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH and is therefore regarded indirectly as a controlling company, Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA qualifies as a dependent company within the meaning of § 17

AktG and accordingly is required to prepare a Dependent Company Report in accordance with § 312 AktG. This report must also contain the statutory concluding statement required in accordance with § 312 AktG which must be included in the management report.
Prior-year figures were not adjusted in accordance with Article 67 (8) sentence 2 of the Introductory Act of the German Commercial Code (Einführungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch, "EGHGB"). Due to the first-time adoption of the provisions set forth under the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz, "BilMoG"), the provisions of §§ 252 (1) no. 6, 265 (1) and 284 (2) no. 3 HGB were applicable in accordance with Article 67 (8) sentence 1 EGHGB.
Compliance with the new provisions of the HGB (BilMoG) meant that the accounting policies applied in the previous year were not carried over completely into the current year. The transition to the new HGB provisions resulted primarily in the following change: equity now contains a presentation of treasury shares in accordance with BilMoG, in which the nominal amount of the treasury shares is deducted from equity under subscribed capital on the face of the balance sheet; furthermore, a reserve for treasury shares is also presented.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fixed assets Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation based on their expected useful lives or at the lower fair value. Player registrations reported in these financial statements are measured at cost, taking into account the decision of the Federal Court of Finance (Bundesfinanzhof,

"BFH") of 26 August 1992, I R 24/91 and the FIFA Regulations on the "Status and Transfer of Players" contained in circular no. 769 of 24 August 2001 which came into force on 21 September 2001, and are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the term of the individual contracts for professional players.

53

BORUSSIA DORTMUND GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. Items with a value between EUR 150.00 to EUR 1,000.00 were recognised as an omnibus item and will be written down over a period of five years. Depreciation and amortisation are based on the economic useful lives of assets.
Long-term financial assets were measured at cost or the lower fair value in case of permanent impairment.
Inventories Inventories are measured at cost less any discounts, subject to the strict lower of cost or market principle.

Prepaid expenses Prepaid expenses consist principally of prepayments relating to the professional squad and insurance premiums. The amounts are reversed rateably over the terms/lives of the individual items.
Provisions Provisions are recognised for all identifiable uncertain liabilities. They are carried at the settlement amounts deemed necessary as dictated by prudent business judgement.
Liabilities Liabilities are recognised at the settlement amount.

Receivables and other assets, cash funds Receivables and other assets are measured at their nominal amounts. General valuation allowances are made for the overall credit and interest-rate risk while separate allowances are recognised for identifiable individual risks. Noninterest-bearing items with a remaining maturity over one year are reported at their discounted present value.
Cash-in-hand and bank balances are recognised at their nominal amounts.

Deferred income In addition to the license fee received in the course of a true sale of receivables in 2007/2008 from the marketing company SPORTFIVE GmbH & Co. KG for the entire term of the agreement, deferred income also includes payments received from ticketing and sponsoring for the 2010/2011 season, and subsequent years. The amounts are reversed rateably over the periods to which they relate.

NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEET

Fixed assets The breakdown of fixed assets is as follows:
EUR '000 Intangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets Long-term financial assets

30/06/2010
21,571 28,443 139,920 189,934

Computer software, purchased trademark rights and player registrations are reported as intangible fixed assets. Changes in this item during financial year 2010/2011 related primarily to additions (EUR 8,561 thousand), offset by amortisation (EUR 8,741 thousand) and write-downs of carrying amounts (EUR 2,307 thousand) in connection with the professional squad. Additions resulted from transfer payments made in relation to the players Robert Lewandowski and Moritz Leitner, as well as subsequent costs for the acquisition of existing transfer rights. Disposals related primarily to the players Nelson Valdez and Tamas Hajnal.
Tangible fixed assets consist principally of real property in the stadium site and the adjoining area "Am Luftbad". They also include the commercial premises constructed on land subject to hereditary building rights and buildings and sporting facilities at the training ground, the youth centre, the catering extensions and other movable components of the stadium, as well as operating and office equipment at these facilities and at the administrative headquarters. The training ground in Dortmund-Brackel was constructed by DSW 21 Dortmunder Stadtwerke AG and let to the Company on a long-term lease.

Investments in the reporting period related primarily to the expansion of operating and office equipment in the stadium and on the training grounds.
Long-term financial assets, in addition to the direct equity investments described in more detail in the list of direct shareholdings, largely comprise a tenant's loan relating to the administration building reported under other loans.
The Company has entered into control and profit and loss transfer agreements with its subsidiaries BVB Stadionmanagement GmbH, BVB Merchandising GmbH and BVB Stadion Holding GmbH. For its part, BVB Stadion Holding GmbH has entered into profit and loss transfer agreements with BVB Stadion GmbH and BVB Beteiligungs-GmbH.
The development of gross fixed assets and of accumulated depreciation and amortisation for the individual items of fixed assets are shown in the following analysis:

Provisions for taxes include the tax obligation in respect of the financial year ended.
Other provisions primarily include provisions for

outstanding invoices (EUR 1,372 thousand), provisions for employer's liability insurance schemes (EUR 516 thousand) and staff-related obligations (EUR 1,375 thousand).

Deferred taxes Changes in the amortisation and depreciation methods used in the financial accounts and the tax accounts result in differences in fixed assets, triggering deferred tax liabilities.
Similarly, the Company has recognised tax loss carryforwards which are being realised due to expected future profits in subsequent years. As a

result, the Company was able to recognise deferred tax assets. Netting results in surplus assets. The Company opted not to recognise these based on the option pursuant to BilMoG in accordance with § 274 HGB (new version).
The average tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes is 32.20 percent.

AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the annual financial statements ­ consisting of the balance sheet, income statement and notes ­ together with the bookkeeping system and the management report of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund, for the financial year from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011.

We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch ­ German Commercial Code] and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [in Deutschland] (IDW).

The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the books and records, the annual financial statements and the management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Company's management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and the management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the results of our audit, the annual financial statements comply with the statutory requirements and the supplementary provisions in the Articles of Association and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Company Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co.

BUSINESS TREND AND FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS

LOOKING BACK ON FINANCIAL YEAR 2010/2011

The achievements of the 2010/2011 financial year, both athletically and from a business perspective, eclipsed even the boldest of hopes and expectations as Borussia Dortmund not only capped off the financial year by winning the German Football Championship but also reported a consolidated net profit of more than 5 million euros!
The biggest milestone of the past financial year was the culmination of the team's sensational athletic performance in winning the 2011 German Football Championship to make it the reigning Bundesliga champion for the seventh time in the history of Borussia Dortmund. The brilliant performance of Coach Jürgen Klopp's young team was applauded throughout the entire German football landscape, well beyond the circle of BVB sympathizers.
Borussia Dortmund has succeeded in putting together a fresh and enthusiastic team that is hungry for success, without having gone into financial debt to do so. This means that the Company will have the anticipated proceeds from the Champions League at its full disposal, as no loans were taken out on the road to the international competition that would have to be serviced. Borussia Dortmund will continue to pursue its philosophy of developing firstclass young players in the future as well.

One thing is certain: for young, ambitious players, Borussia Dortmund is the team to be on. This is demonstrated not only by the policy pursued jointly by the management and by sport director Michael Zorc of securing long-term relationships with key players, but also by the fact that five members of the German national team now come from Borussia Dortmund: Mats Hummels, Marcel Schmelzer, Kevin Großkreutz, Sven Bender and Mario Götze.
Borussia Dortmund will keep this paradigm in place. Transfer income and expenses are again balanced for the current season. The personnel budget for licensed players has been raised to meet the coming challenges of the Champions League.
The trend in sponsoring proceeds has been extraordinarily good, and by selling 53,000 season tickets, Borussia Dortmund set a new record, both internally and for the entire Bundesliga.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN GERMAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL

Match attendance
As reported by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, a new attendance record was set in the 2010/2011 season with an average of 42,101 attendees at the 306 first-division matches. The increase of 0.7% on the previous season allowed the 42,000 mark to be broken for the first time ever. The previous record was 41,905 attendees per match, set in the 2008/2009 season.
Apart from winning the German championship, Borussia Dortmund led the pack in attendance figures as well with 78,416 spectators per game to fill the stadium at 97.23% capacity.

Bundesliga TV marketing
According to a statement made by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH on 20 June 2011, the League Association has taken a crucial step with respect to marketing Bundesliga media rights. The German Federal Cartel Office informed DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH that it may continue to pursue its proven practice of centralised marketing based on the Federal Cartel Office's initial assessment following a comprehensive market survey and an analysis of the concepts submitted for the distribution of media rights. Accordingly, a call for tenders may be put out for a distribution option involving an early highlight report on Saturdays on the Internet and for smart phones as an alternative to a scenario involving an

early free TV report. In the opinion of the Federal Cartel Office, it is important that the bidding process be transparent and discrimination-free, particularly with regard to the packaging of the rights. In the coming weeks, DFL will design the call for tenders in close cooperation with the Federal Cartel Office to include at least two distribution scenarios aimed at encouraging competition. The call for tenders is expected to be put out at the end of 2011.
BVB total
Borussia Dortmund is now in the television business too. Since January 2011, Borussia Dortmund has been the first Bundesliga team to offer its own TV package in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom. In addition to all of Borussia Dortmund's official matches, "BVB Total" includes reports, current news and a look behind the scenes. All BVB Bundesliga matches are broadcast live, and matches in other competitions are available via delayed streaming. "BVB Total" can be seen on Deutsche Telekom's "Liga Total!" platform, which is part of its "Entertain" product.
Like other teams, Borussia Dortmund has already been offering interviews and match highlights via the internet. However, this is the first time that a team is using its own TV channel as a marketing tool in Germany.
UEFA club licensing
In its regulations on club licensing and financial fair play (2010 version), UEFA has defined the rights, obligations and responsibilities of all parties involved in the UEFA club licensing procedure and described the requirements that a club must fulfil to obtain a license entitling it to take part in UEFA club competitions.

The measures introduced as part of UEFA's new regulations on club licensing and financial fair play are intended to encourage clubs to manage their finances better and to strike a sustainable balance between income, expenses and investments. The most important factor in receiving future permission to play from UEFA is the break-even requirement, which will take effect at the end of the 2012 reporting year, be reviewed during the 2013/2014 European Cup season and result in sanctions in cases of non-adherence.
International competitions
League. Thanks to the successes of German teams in international competitions, Germany has secured third place in the UEFA five-year rankings behind England and Spain. The third-place spot guarantees three fixed slots in the European premier league, with the fourth-ranked Bundesliga team able to play its way in to the Champions League. However, this will not affect the coming season. Not until the 2012/2013 season will Germany be able to send four teams to the Champions League. The German premier league last sent four clubs to this lucrative European competition in the 2001/2002 season.
Germany's advance has come at the expense of Italy's Serie A, which the Bundesliga has pushed back from third to fourth place in the UEFA five-year rankings. Since the 2006/2007 season ­ which was weak from a German perspective ­ will no longer be included in the rankings as of the start of the coming season, the Bundesliga is currently in second place in interim scoring for 2011/2012, just ahead of Spain.

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

SPORTS MANAGEMENT
Although our successful restructuring has led to financially stable results, in the future we will nonetheless continue to focus on achieving success on the field under a cost-optimised budget. To accomplish this objective, Borussia Dortmund will continue to put together a competitive team in the future with an emphasis on young, promising players.
Our sporting objectives will be aligned with our financial circumstances, meaning that the makeup of the squad and its cost structure will continue to depend on calculable variables on the income side. Qualifying for and successfully participating in international competitions would provide the financial flexibility for additionally reinforcing the squad. Our medium-term goal must therefore be for the team to establish a presence in European competitions.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
A key goal of the management of Borussia Dortmund is to achieve a lasting increase in profitability along with bolstering its financial strength. In addition to steadily improving the operating result, the generation of positive cash flows is therefore the most important financial objective of our Company. We seek to optimise cash flows by concentrating on the "operating result" and "investments" as impacting factors.

The operating result ­ which at the Borussia Dortmund Group refers to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) ­ is a key indicator for measuring success. For this reason, we constantly monitor our segments' operating results using monthly comparisons of budgeted and actual situations. To optimize the operating result, the main factors to leverage are sales revenues, which can be additionally improved in the major revenue categories of ticketing, sponsorship, TV marketing and merchandising, and operating expenses, which can be lowered through disciplined management.
In the coming years we will concentrate on generating steady sales growth while limiting operating expenditure. The decisive factor in this respect will be qualifying for international competitions.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The capital management responsibilities of the Company's management involve stabilising and increasing the equity of the Borussia Dortmund Group as calculated in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). One of the main ways in which we will reach these objectives is by improving the operating result and making effective investments.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

CORPORATE STRATEGY

The Borussia Dortmund Group continues to pursue its medium-term goal of re-establishing itself as one of the leading football clubs in the Bundesliga. After having successfully reorganised the Company, restructured our financial liabilities and made investments in our professional squad, we consider ourselves to be on the right path.
As the first and thus far only German listed football company, we have expanded our financial base by exclusively marketing the rights to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK, using the "Borussia Dortmund" brand more effectively and establishing football-related lines of business. However, professional football with its classic revenue sources of TV marketing, sponsorship, ticketing and merchandising will remain the Group's core business in future. The Borussia Dortmund Group is confident that it will be able to further stabilise and expand its position for the following reasons:

mance less dependent on short-term sporting success in the future, the Borussia Dortmund Group will continue to push ahead with marketing its brand name both nationally and internationally.
· Germany continues to be Europe's largest football market, although it lags behind certain other European markets in financial terms. This means that Germany has major growth potential.
All financial activities of the Borussia Dortmund Group are geared toward the target groups relevant to a football club: its fans, members and business partners. Products and services should be tailored to these groups as closely as possible. The Borussia Dortmund Group intends to use the brand potential at its disposal to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities inherent in professional club football at an international level.

· Borussia Dortmund is in sporting terms one of the most successful, well known and popular German football clubs with an outstanding fan base that gives it one of the highest average spectator numbers in Europe.
· A football company can only be financially successful if it enjoys sporting success over the long term. In order to make its financial perfor-

Its current business strategy can principally be summarised as follows:
· Sustainably adjusting athletic prospects · Intensifying the promotion of up and coming
talent · Increasing fan involvement · Taking advantage of the "Borussia Dortmund"
brand

However, financial performance and the business trend are largely dependent on sporting success. Since sporting success is very difficult to plan, the best that management can do is to create a good foundation for success. Investments, particularly in the professional squad, are therefore a necessary prerequisite for achieving sporting objectives such as qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. However, in order to meet financial objectives, planned investments and decisions must under certain circumstances be postponed to the extent these would only be possible by incurring new debt. Moreover, a player might be sold based on financial considerations in cases where this would not have happened had the decision been made purely on the basis of sporting criteria.
Thus a conflict arises between the pursuit of financial interests and sporting interests, i.e. a situation in which sporting considerations and financial considerations may be at odds with each other, particularly if the club continually falls short of its sporting goals. In such cases, management weighs the opportunities and risks to find a solution that does adequate justice to the Company's strategic objectives.

Sponsorship plays a key role in this context. Over the years, sponsorship has grown to become one of the Company's largest revenue categories. In contrast to central TV marketing, where distribution is already clearly defined in advance, Company management is itself able to determine the requirements for and direction of sponsoring activities and, if necessary, change the strategy implemented as circumstances change. The key figures for the sponsoring segment have already been budgeted for the coming years based on commitments from SIGNAL IDUNA (until 2016) and Evonik Industries AG (until 2013), the Company's chief partners.
Revenues from international competitions are more difficult to budget for, since they depend solely on the team's athletic performance.
Another key strategic management parameter is transfer income. It must be decided whether to sell sought-after players or to retain them to pursue greater athletic goals over the long term.
Achieving positive operating results and making the investments that depend on such results, mainly in the professional squad, should enable cash flows to stabilise at a positive level on a lasting basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This past season was one of the Borussia Dortmund Group's most successful financial years ever, not only in terms of athletic success but also from a business perspective. Demand for the Borussia Dortmund brand has increased even more thanks to the team's winning the German championship, playing in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League and, most of all, the likeability and genuine nature of the players and their enthusiasm for football. During the reporting period (1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011), the Group generated revenue of EUR 151,478 thousand (previous

year: EUR 110,142 thousand) and gross revenue of EUR 155,785 thousand, a rise of EUR 43,563 thousand on the previous financial year.
The Group ended the financial year with a net profit of EUR 5,400 thousand under IFRS, an improvement of EUR 11,549 thousand.
The result from operating activities (EBIT) increased by EUR 15,416 thousand on the prior year to EUR 14,908 thousand in 2010/2011.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

The performance of the individual revenue items is described in the following:
Income from match operations
Income from match operations amounted to EUR 27,679 thousand, an increase of EUR 4,280 thousand on the prior year.

Income from advertising
Sponsorship income increased by EUR 11,109 thousand year on year to EUR 49,972 thousand, again making this the main revenue item of the Borussia Dortmund Group in financial year 2010/2011. Revenue from sponsorship constitutes approximately 33% of total revenue.

With an average attendance of 78,416 to put SIGNAL IDUNA PARK at 97% capacity throughout the season, Borussia Dortmund again increased revenue from Bundesliga ticket sales, which rose by EUR 1,714 thousand year on year to EUR 23,502 thousand. The Borussia Dortmund Group thus made a major contribution to the Bundesliga's new attendance record. The 18 Bundesliga teams welcomed an average of 42,101 attendees per home game to 306 games for the highest spectator numbers in the history of the football league. Borussia Dortmund's leading position in the market is not only due to the success enjoyed in the past season but also to our loyal fans and the unique atmosphere at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
The Company generated proceeds from international ticket sales of EUR 3,350 thousand based on participation in the UEFA Europa League and the four home games this involved. In the previous year, Borussia Dortmund did not play in any international competitions after having failed to qualify on the last day of play.
Match operations generated an additional EUR 827 thousand from friendly matches, the two away games in the DFB-Cup and matches played by the regional league team.

In addition to our main sponsor, Evonik Industries AG, SIGNAL IDUNA, which owns the naming rights for the "nicest stadium in the world", and equipment supplier Kappa Deutschland GmbH, other renowned companies acting as Champion Partners for Borussia Dortmund were the Radeberger Group, SEAT Deutschland GmbH, Sparda Bank Münster eG and SPREHE Geflügel- u. Tiefkühlfeinkost Handels GmbH & Co. KG. For the coming financial year, we have acquired even more prominent companies as Champion Partners.
At the end of the 2010/2011 season, the hospitality areas of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK ­ the "regulars' table" level, the business club, Borussia Park and the "Rote Erde Club" ­ were at 94% capacity, up from 90% in 2009/2010. Also quite popular among companies were our "incentives packages" ­ offers for business clients wishing to invite guests to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK for specific games only. Demand for the local derby, and particularly for the last game of the season, was so immense that Borussia Dortmund had to set up an additional hospitality area under a tent in order to satisfy most of the requests for space. In June 2011 it already was clear that capacity of 100% would be possible even before the new Bundesliga season started.

Advertising income also included the bonuses associated with qualifying for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, winning the German championship and accordingly qualifying for the 2011/2012 UEFA Champions League.
In January 2011, the Borussia Dortmund Group introduced a new marketing concept. It is the first Bundesliga club to offer its own television product via Sports & Bytes, a wholly-owned Group subsidiary. "BVB Total" includes reports, current news and a look behind the scenes in addition to all of Borussia Dortmund's official matches. It can be viewed on Deutsche Telekom AG's "Liga Total!" platform, which is part of its "Entertain" product.
Income from TV marketing
Income from TV marketing increased to EUR 32,094 thousand in the financial year just ended, a rise of EUR 11,003 thousand compared to financial year 2009/2010.
Income from national TV marketing rose by EUR 6,579 thousand to EUR 26,775 thousand based on the club's top ranking at the end of the season and No. 2 spot in the weighted four-year rankings.
Television income of EUR 4,944 thousand was generated from participation in international competition (qualifying round and subsequent group stage). Starting at the group stage, UEFA is in charge of TV marketing of the UEFA Europa League, which in addition to the market pool includes fixed and performance-based bonuses as well as match bonuses from centralised marketing. In the qualifying round, the television rights may still be offered decentrally on the market.
An additional EUR 375 thousand was generated based on participation in two DFB-Cup matches and membership of the U23 team in the regional league.

Transfer income
At EUR 12,995 thousand, transfer income exceeded the previous year's figure by EUR 8,063 thousand.
In the financial year under review, Nuri Sahin was transferred along with Nelson Valdez, Tamas Hajnal and Markus Feulner. The transfer income reported in 2009/2010 came primarily from the transfer of Alexander Frei to FC Basel.
Income from retail, catering and licences including other income
The Borussia Dortmund Group registered an additional increase in revenue in the areas of retail, catering, licences and other income, which increased by EUR 6,881 thousand between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011 to reach EUR 28,738 thousand.
The breakdown of revenue by division is as follows:
Although merchandise sales got off to a slow start in the past fiscal year, BVB Merchandising GmbH ultimately contributed 9.7% to Group revenue, making it one of the Borussia Dortmund Group's main income drivers. Sales of items bearing the Borussia Dortmund logo grew by EUR 5,542 thousand over the prior financial year to EUR 14,010 thousand due to the German championship and the fans' high level of identification with the team, its coach and the Borussia Dortmund club. In addition to jerseys, which were the highest selling item at 20.16% of total merchandise sales, and products related to the German championship (198,053 items sold), the production and sale of World Cup merchandise proved to be a moneymaker in the 2010/2011 season. Demand for merchandise remained high even in June 2011, especially for jerseys for the upcoming season.
Catering improved by 3.66% to EUR 9,035 thousand, primarily thanks to the four additional home games

due to participation in the UEFA Europa League at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
Rental and lease income, advance booking fees and other ticketing fees increased by EUR 870 thousand over the prior-year figure to EUR 5,233 thousand.

Other operating income improved by EUR 2,227 thousand as compared to the previous reporting period to EUR 4,307 thousand, mainly as a result of inclusion of professional squad members Bender, Götze, Großkreutz, Hummels and Schmelzer on the German national team.

CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES

Staff costs
Staff costs amounted to EUR 61,541 thousand in 2010/2011, up from EUR 47,961 thousand in the previous year. Staff costs for the professional squad increased by EUR 12,018 thousand over the prioryear figure to EUR 49,471 thousand. In addition to the increase in the professional squad budget, which was planned in advance, bonus payments correlating with the team's success on the field played a large part in the rise in staff costs. However, staff costs also increased by approximately EUR 2,655 thousand in the retail and administrative areas as a result of the championship bonuses, though also due to establishment of a marketing department and increasing our employee base to enable us to handle forthcoming projects and meet rising demand for services. By contrast, staff costs for other match operations, which include the U23 team and the U19 junior team, decreased by EUR 1,096 thousand due in part to relegation of the U23 team to the regional league.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment
Depreciation, amortisation and impairment rose by EUR 375 thousand to EUR 17,534 thousand in the re-

porting period. Intangible assets were the main factor in the increase.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses amounted to EUR 54,144 thousand in the reporting period compared with EUR 42,927 thousand in the previous year.
Apart from the increase in match operations of EUR 3,445 thousand due to the additional organisation of international games and travel to away matches abroad, the greatest increase in other operating expenses related to advertising expenses, including marketing agency fees, which rose by EUR 3,338 thousand, and transfer expenses (primarily writedowns of carrying amounts), which rose by EUR 2,431 thousand.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs amounted to EUR 5,412 thousand in 2010/2011, down from EUR 5,669 thousand in the prior year.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

NET ASSETS

Total assets of the Borussia Dortmund Group increased from EUR 215,161 thousand to EUR 221,726 thousand. The increase resulted mainly from the rise in trade and other receivables, which had grown by EUR

15,457 thousand as at the reporting date. This increase was offset in part by the decrease in fixed assets.

OVERALL SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE

The Borussia Dortmund Group ended the financial year with a consolidated net profit of EUR 5,400 thousand and total comprehensive income of EUR 5,632 thousand, an improvement of EUR 11,549 thousand and EUR 11,781 thousand respectively. The equity ratio is stable and, taking into account the net profit for the year, amounts to 30.50%. As at

30 June 2011, Borussia Dortmund held cash of EUR 1,087 thousand, none of which was subject to restrictions. The Group had access to an additional EUR 10,000 thousand in overdraft facilities as at the reporting date, EUR 2,246 thousand of which had been drawn down as at 30 June 2011.

REMUNERATION REPORT

The structure of the management remuneration system is determined and regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Advisory Board. The Executive Committee of the Advisory Board of Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH is also responsible for determining the remuneration of management in detail and setting the appropriate amount of remuneration. The principal criteria for determining the appropriate amount of remuneration are the responsibilities of the particular member of management, his personal performance and the financial situation, profits and future prospects of the Borussia Dortmund Group.
Management remuneration comprises two components: a fixed amount and a variable component. The fixed remuneration component is stipulated by contract and is paid out in twelve equal monthly instalments. The variable remuneration component is based on the business trend and is dependent on net profit for the year before tax and the managing di-

rectors' remuneration. Any additional non-cash or ancillary benefits granted relate primarily to insurance benefits at standard market conditions and provision of a company car. The Group does not offer any stock option plans or similar incentive plans. The remuneration components provided are reasonable both in and of themselves and taken as a whole.
Remuneration of the Supervisory Board is governed by § 13 of the Articles of Association, pursuant to which each member of the Supervisory Board receives fixed remuneration amounting to EUR 7 thousand; the Chairman receives twice that amount and the Deputy Chairman one and a half times that amount. Value added tax is reimbursed to the members of the Supervisory Board.
The disclosures required by § 314 (1) No. 6 of the HGB are included in the notes to the financial statements.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT

The divisions of the Borussia Dortmund Group are exposed to a wide variety of risks that are inseparably linked to the conduct of business. A functioning control and monitoring system is essential to the early identification and assessment of and systematic response to these risks. It is the responsibility of the Group's internal risk management system to monitor and control such potential risks.
The risk management system is based on principles and guidelines laid out by the management. These principles and guidelines are designed to facilitate the early identification of any irregularities so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. In order to ensure the highest possible level of transparency, risk management has been incorporated into the organisational structure of the Group as a whole. All departments and divisions are required to immediately report any market-relevant changes in the risk portfolio to the management. The risk management system is also an integral component

of the overarching planning, steering and reporting process.
This year, the risk inventory procedure implemented with the objective of cataloguing and assessing all risks has again proven effective as a management tool. Risks are identified, discussed and reviewed in consideration of current circumstances in one-onone meetings or plenary sessions in order to assess the current likelihood of their occurring and the extent of the losses they might entail. In so doing, particular emphasis is placed on high priority risks that could significantly jeopardise the ability of the Borussia Dortmund Group to continue as a going concern. Thus the organisational groundwork has been laid to enable the Group to identify any changes to the risk situation that may emerge early on. Regular risk reports to the governing bodies of the Borussia Dortmund Group keep them informed of the Group's current risk profile, enabling them to monitor and manage risk.

THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS

The key features of the accounting process-related internal control and risk management system employed by the Borussia Dortmund Group can be described as follows: · the Borussia Dortmund Group distinguishes it-
self through its clear organisational and corporate structures as well as its control and monitoring structures; · the internal control and risk management systems as they relate to the accounting process form an integral part of operational and strategic planning processes; · responsibilities have been clearly assigned in all areas of the accounting process (such as financial accounting and management cost accounting); · reporting is carried out in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual intervals, whereby a distinction is made between matters requiring immediate action by the Company and those involving Company strategy; · the computer systems used in accounting are protected from unauthorised access; · an adequate system of internal guidelines has been established and is updated as needed;

· the departments involved in the accounting process fulfil quantitative and qualitative requirements;
· the completeness and accuracy of the accounting data is checked regularly by reviewing samples and conducting plausibility tests, both manually and by means of software employed for this purpose;
· the principle of dual control is adhered to at all points in the Group's accounting-related processes;
· the management receives reports at scheduled intervals throughout the process or more frequently if necessary;
· the Supervisory Board deals with the key accounting issues, risk management and the audit engagement, among other things.
The accounting process-related internal control and risk management system, the key features of which are described above, ensures that transactions can be correctly recorded, prepared and accounted for in the financial statements.

SPECIFIC RISKS

STRATEGIC RISK
The economic trend of a football company depends on its athletic performance. However, this can only be planned to a certain extent, meaning that financial and corporate planning must be aimed at maintaining the profitability of the company ­ even in the face of setbacks ­ so as to avoid risks to the Company's future existence. Long-term affiliations and

partnerships ensure a certain level of planning security, independently of sporting success. Moreover, it is important to reconcile the conflict between pursuing athletic objectives ­ including taking the measures necessary to achieve such objectives ­ and meeting financial requirements such as assuring adequate liquidity.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

In addition, in order for its team to participate in Bundesliga matches Borussia Dortmund requires a licence, which is issued for each season by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH. Issue of this licence has a significant impact on the Company's financial position and financial performance by its very nature. As in previous years, Borussia Dortmund has been issued a licence for the coming season without any conditions or requirements.
PERSONNEL RISK
The importance of human resources to companies is growing. Thus personnel risk represents a central risk category in a company's risk management organisation.
The core business of the Borussia Dortmund Group ­ participating in Bundesliga matches ­ is largely dependent on the Company's human resources. Athletic success, which forms the basis for economic success, is heavily dependent on the professional sports squad and the quality of the players. Intensive scouting and medical examinations are intended to help the Company avoid making ill-advised investments in signing new players. Absences of key players, for example due to injury, cannot be foreseen and, as a result, may jeopardise the ability of the Company to meet internally defined objectives.
Yet in the non-sports segments as well, the use of qualified specialists and executives is essential for the Group; thus it is important that the Company retain them over the long term.
MACROECONOMIC RISK
The trend in future funding through sponsorship is difficult to foresee. The Borussia Dortmund Group has laid the groundwork for the coming years by entering into long-term contracts with major sponsors. Since many companies ­ primarily SMEs ­ are

currently employing caution in waiting to see how the market will develop, we cannot yet reliably forecast whether last years' total volume in sponsorship can be achieved again this year.
Given current circumstances, it should be noted that it is impossible to plan and manage the risk of interruptions to match operations, for example due to outbreak of an epidemic. Nor is it possible to foresee the potential financial ramifications of such a situation.
The Borussia Dortmund Group has been subject to tax audits and audits by social security authorities in the past. The Borussia Dortmund Group is of the opinion that its tax returns were submitted completely and correctly and that its social security contributions were paid in full and on time. However, should the tax or social security authorities view the situation differently due to a diverging assessment of the facts, it is possible that they could later make additional claims that could impact the Company's financial position and performance.
COMPETITIVE RISK
The UEFA regulations on club licensing and financial fair play were adopted in May 2010. The regulations aim
· to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances
· to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues
· to protect the integrity and smooth running of competitions
· to encourage responsible spending for the longterm benefit of football clubs
· to ensure that clubs settle their liabilities punctually
· to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of European club football.

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

The process will be introduced gradually starting with the 2011/2012 season. Starting with the reports on liabilities and future financial information, the most important factor in receiving permission to play from UEFA in the future will be the breakeven requirement, which will take effect at the end of the 2012 reporting year, be reviewed during the

2013/2014 European Cup season and result in sanctions in cases of non-adherence. The club monitoring procedure will be supervised by UEFA's Club Financial Control Panel, which may request additional information from the licence applicant and/or the licensing body at any time during this process.

FINANCIAL RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK
The Borussia Dortmund Group bears the financing risk related to SIGNAL IDUNA PARK. The Group is presently not subject to any interest rate risk thanks to the fixed-interest credit agreements entered into for the coming years.
Management has entered into interest rate swap transactions with German Landesbanken (i.e. banks local to Germany's individual states or "Länder") in order to lock in low interest rates over the medium to long term and hedge the risk of changes in cash flows due to changing interest rates.
CREDIT RISK
The Group conducts business exclusively with third parties of high credit standing. Credit risk may arise in the context of player transfers and long-term sponsorship agreements as well as from centralised marketing agreements.
One fixed-interest loan with a principal amount of EUR 20,000 thousand and which matures in June 2013 is subject to covenants with respect to the Group's equity ratio and interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) as stated in the consoli-

dated financial statements. In addition, covenants are in place in relation to an overdraft facility in the amount of EUR 5,000 thousand. These covenants relate to the equity ratio, net debt/EBITDA and the interest coverage ratio. The covenants are reviewed on an annual basis. As at the end of the reporting period, all covenants had been complied with.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable at any point in time to meet regular payment obligations on time and in the full amount.
Regular reporting and strict controls aimed at adherence to target figures, approved budgets and KPIs ensure that the Company's liquidity remains a transparent variable. Liquidity is constantly monitored through liquidity planning, which takes expected cash flows into consideration. As with any planning, an inherent risk exists in that current estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from the planning statements. However, there is a general risk that budgeted proceeds may not be realised due, for example, to agreements not being able to be honoured as entered into due to the poor economic climate and/or insolvency of the customer.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF RISK POSITION

With regard to the risks discussed in this report and the review of the overall risk position, no risks were identified in the financial year under review that would contribute to a permanent or material deterioration in the financial position or financial performance of either the Group or its individual companies.
Thanks to its risk management system, the Borussia Dortmund Group is in a position to comply with

the statutory provisions on control and transparency in the Company.
A review of the risk position indicated that the aggregate total of the individual risks defined within the risk areas does not pose a threat to the ability of the Borussia Dortmund Group to continue as a going concern.

REPORT ON EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS

ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP

The Borussia Dortmund Group capped off the past 2010/2011 season by winning the German championship and taking a firm grasp on the Bundesliga table following match day 34. The team's playing success, by virtue of which it qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League, has also increased its financial prospects in nearly all income areas.

Notwithstanding these new circumstances, the Borussia Dortmund Group still intends to leverage its stable, robust equity base and continue to avoid incalculable financial risk in pursuing its athletic goals.

EXPECTED GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

In the 2011/2012 season the Bundesliga is anticipating being rewarded for its sustainable management and outstanding athletic performance: the Bundesliga has been promised the right to send a fourth team to the UEFA Champions League, the premiere league in European club football, starting in the 2012/2013 season.
Changes are also on the horizon in national cup competition. The German Football Association (DFB) is hoping to use its new strategy for marketing the DFBCup to generate additional revenues for the clubs competing for the trophy starting in 2012. Contrary to the model practiced to date of offering the national cup matches and the international matches as a pa-

ckage, starting this year the call for tenders will go out for the DFB-Cup as a separate segment according to General Secretary Wolfgang Niersbach. At present, subscription broadcaster Sky as well as ARD and ZDF own the broadcasting rights, which generate approximately EUR 50 million for DFB. These are distributed among the 64 qualifying teams, depending on how well they place. The plan to market the DFB-Cup separately is aimed at making the Cup competition more attractive for private free TV channels in addition to realizing opportunities for creating new marketing content. Telekom, which already reports on the Bundesliga under its "Liga total!" brand, could also be interested.

93

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

On 6 June 2011, DFB announced on its website that it would be conducting an open, transparent and discrimination-free bidding process for award of the audio-visual media rights to the men's DFB-Cup competition matches and the final match of the women's DFB-Cup competition in the Federal Republic of Germany. The call for tenders will apply to the four seasons from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. Companies in-

terested in acquiring these rights were able to register with DFB until 21 June 2011.
In the area of ticket sales, the Borussia Dortmund Group set a new season ticket league record by selling 53,000 tickets for the 2011/2012 season. The new "Vorwerk Lounge" in the southeast corner of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK also caters to rising demand for hospitality seats.

EXPECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ANTICIPATED EARNINGS TREND
As in previous years, success on the field will be a major factor in determining our earnings trend. We have laid the foundation for generating additional revenue from international competition by qualifying for participation in the UEFA Champions League.
The management assumes that in financial year 2011/2012 and the following financial year, a net profit will be reported in the single-entity financial statements of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA in addition to a consolidated net profit.
ANTICIPATED REVENUE TREND
The Borussia Dortmund Group generated revenue of EUR 151,478 thousand in the financial year just ended, an increase of EUR 41,336 thousand on the previous season.

ANTICIPATED TREND IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES
Strict cost controls enable the management to minimise other operating expenses and to identify and realise savings potentials.
However, the trend in operating expenses depends to a great extent on the number of official matches in a season, meaning that forecasting changes in this item always involves a prediction of athletic performance.
Staff costs will again remain on a level with those in the previous financial year, although the Borussia Dortmund Group has been able to maintain the core team and even to strengthen it in some respects.

The income situation could be similar in the following year thanks to the team's qualification for the UEFA Champions League.

EXPECTED DIVIDENDS

Given the Group's current and non-current financial liabilities, which still amount to EUR 61,108 thousand, a dividend payment would not be appropriate

until the Borussia Dortmund Group has re-established itself on the international sporting scene and generated long-term, substantial profits.

94

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

PROJECTED FINANCIAL POSITION

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIALP LANNING
We are continuing to focus our investing activities on our professional squad and on additional measures to modernise SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
Thus, we will concentrate on the core business of the Borussia Dortmund Group and, in so doing, will not be taking any financial risk that cannot be calculated in advance. In essence, this means that we will only be incurring capital expenditure to the extent permitted by our anticipated financial leeway. As part of capital expenditure planning, the Borussia Dortmund Group

will thus not count on any uncertain sporting successes which, if they failed to materialise, would lead to substantial new debt.
ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY TREND
Repayments of the long-term loans to finance the stadium continue to be made on schedule. Moreover, Borussia Dortmund has been able to make substantial investments in strengthening the professional squad. Going forward, we will continue to use non-earmarked funds to strengthen the athletics department while ensuring that the Borussia Dortmund Group remains solvent at all times.

OPPORTUNITIES

The Borussia Dortmund Group's greatest opportunities lie in unlocking and exploiting additional revenue potential by participating in international competitions such as the UEFA Champions League. In addition, an international presence would almost certainly have a positive impact on the merchandising business.
Further significant earnings potential would result from successful participation in the DFB-Cup, the

German cup competition. However, the financial benefits also depend, to a large extent, on which teams we are drawn against.
Moreover, the management is aware of the fact that the Borussia Dortmund Group has high-quality young players on its squad who are greatly valued on the market and have a high transfer potential.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE

The past season exceeded even the boldest of expectations and put the Borussia Dortmund Group in a position to reap the financial fruits of its success on a lasting basis. Media coverage of the team's parti-

cipation in the UEFA Champions League, the prestige of winning the championship and a likeability factor that cannot be put into numbers will also translate into financial benefits.

REPORT ON POST-BALANCE SHEET DATE EVENTS

Borussia Dortmund was pleased to welcome three new Champion Partners in July and August of 2011. Borussia Dortmund succeeded in acquiring Wilo, the world's leading high-tech pump manufacturer located in Dortmund, as a new Champion Partner. Wilo already has a tradition of involvement with Borussia Dortmund, as SIGNAL IDUNA PARK is fully equipped with Wilo products.
Borussia Dortmund's second new Champion partner is Yanmar, a manufacturer of industrial engines as well as agricultural and construction machinery headquartered in Osaka, Japan. This partnership is of particular interest to Yanmar owing to BVB professional Shinji Kagawa, whose football roots are with Cerezo Osaka, of which Yanmar has been the main sponsor for some time.
Another new Champion Partner of Borussia Dortmund is Q-Cells, a globally leading photovoltaics company.
After a good showing in the preseason (including beating out Mainz 05, Hamburger SV and Bayern München to win the T-Home Cup), Coach Jürgen Klopp's team started the regular season with a clear 3:0 win in the first round of the DFB-Cup at an away game against third-division team SV Sandhausen. For the following round in October, Borussia Dort-

mund drew a home game at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK against second-division team Dynamo Dresden.

Borussia Dortmund then started the 2011/2012 Bundesliga season with a heated 3:1 win over Hamburger SV. The opening game of the current German champion was viewed by football fans in 199 countries all over the world. The season started well on the whole as the young team followed a 0:1 loss in their first away game at TSG Hoffenheim with a 2:0 victory against 1. FC Nürnberg on match day 3.

Participation in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League is yet another step for Borussia Dortmund on the way to international success. The drawing for the Champions League group stage held on 25 August 2011 in Monaco has provided the team with a challenge, having set it against some interesting and strong opponents in European professional football.

5. There is no control of voting rights in cases in which employees are shareholders.
6. Because of its legal form as a partnership limited by shares, Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA does not have a management board. Instead, management and representation of the Company is the responsibility of the general partner. The provisions of § 6 No. 1 of the Articles of Association stipulate that Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH, with registered offices in Dortmund, is to act as such an executive body on a permanent basis and not for a limited period of time by virtue of its status as a shareholder. The appointment and removal of managing directors of

Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH is governed by § 8 No. 6 of its shareholders' agreement and is the responsibility of the Executive Committee of its Advisory Board, and therefore not of the Supervisory Board of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA. In principle, changes may be made to the Articles of Association of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA only by a resolution of its General Shareholders' Meeting, which, in accordance with § 133 (1) of the AktG, must be passed by a simple majority of votes and also, in accordance with § 15 No. 3 of the Articles of Association of the Company in conjunction with § 179 (1) and (2) of the AktG, by a simple majority of the capital represented on the date of the resolution, except to the extent that mandatory statutory provisions or the Articles of Association stipulate otherwise.

sentence 1 of the AktG. The Supervisory Board is authorised in accordance with § 12 No. 5 of the Articles of Association to resolve changes to the Articles of Association which relate only to the wording thereof, in particular in connection with the amount of capital increases from authorised and conditional capital. 7. The general partner is authorised until 29 November 2015, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital by a maximum of EUR 30,712,500.00 in total by issuing new no-par value ordinary bearer shares against cash and/or in-kind contributions on one or more occasions (Authorised Capital 2010). The limited liability shareholders have a statutory preemptive right over new shares issued by the Company. Such new shares may also be subscribed by a bank or a company in accordance with § 53 (1) Sentence 1 or § 53b (1) sentence 1 or (7) of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz, "KWG") if it agrees to offer them to the limited liability shareholders for subscription. However, the general partner is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to decide to disapply the statutory pre-emptive subscription rights of the limited liability shareholders. Pre-emptive subscription rights may be disapplied a) with respect to fractional amounts arising as a
consequence of subscription ratios; b) in the event of capital increases against cash
contributions up to a total amount of 10% of the share capital existing on the date of registration of the Authorized Capital 2010 or, if lower, 10% of the share capital existing on the date of exercise of the authorisation (in each case taking into account any other authorisations made use of during the effective period of this authorisation for the disapplication of pre-emptive subscription rights pursuant to or through the corresponding application of § 186 (3) sentence 4 of the AktG), provided the issue amount of the new shares does not fall significantly below the market price; c) in the event of capital increases against inkind contributions, particularly for the purpose of acquiring companies, equity investments, real estate, rights and claims against the Company.

The general partner is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and the terms and conditions of the share issue.
In the event of a takeover bid for shares issued by the Company and admitted to trading on a regulated market, the general statutory responsibilities and powers apply to the general partner in other respects. For example, if a takeover bid were to be received, the general partner and the Supervisory Board would be required to issue and publish a response to the bid, giving their reasons, in accordance with § 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbsund Übernahmegesetz, "WpÜG") to enable the limited liability shareholders to make a decision on the bid on an informed basis. Moreover, in accordance with § 33 of the WpÜG, once a takeover bid has been announced, the general partner may not take any actions outside the ordinary course of business that could frustrate the success of the bid, unless those actions have been authorised by the General Shareholders' Meeting, or the Supervisory Board has given its approval of the actions or the actions relate to obtaining a competing bid. In making their decisions, the general partner and the Supervisory Board are bound to have regard to the interests of the Company, its employees and its shareholders. At the end of the reporting period, the Articles of Association did not contain any provisions within the meaning of §§ 33a ­ 33c of the WpÜG (European prohibition on frustrating action, European breakthrough rule, reservation of reciprocity).
8. The Company is not a party to any material agreements which are conditional on a change of control following a takeover bid for the issued shares of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA.
9. The Company is not a party to any compensation agreements that would apply in the event of a takeover bid.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIC PRINCIPLES

BASIS AND METHODS OF PREPARATION
Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA ("BVB") has its registered office at Rheinlanddamm 207-209, 44137 Dortmund, Germany. BVB's professional team has participated in the Bundesliga for more than three decades. In addition, BVB Group companies are engaged in the sale of merchandise, the provision of internet and travel agency services, the running of a medical rehabilitation centre and the operation of the football stadium in Dortmund, SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.
The general partner, BVB GeschäftsführungsGmbH, is responsible for management and representation of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA. Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH is for its part represented by Managing Directors Hans-Joachim Watzke (Chairman) and Thomas Treß; its sole shareholder is BV. Borussia 09 e.V. Dortmund.
These consolidated financial statements of BVB for the financial year from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, including the prior-year information, were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted in the European Union and in force at the end of the reporting period, and the supplementary provisions of German commercial law required to be observed in accordance with § 315a (1) HGB. The term "IFRS" includes the recent International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the International Accounting Standards (IASs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in London as well as the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).

BVB applied the following Standards, Interpretations and amendments to existing Standards, as adopted by the European Union, for the first time in the 2010/2011 financial year:
· In October 2008, the IFRIC published Interpretation 15 "Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate". The Interpretation clarifies the accounting practice for the recognition of revenue by real estate developers for sales of units before construction is complete. IFRIC 15 provides guidance on how to determine whether an agreement for the construction of real estate is within the scope of IAS 11 or IAS 18. The Interpretation must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The application of the Interpretation has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In November 2008, the IASB published a restructured version of IFRS 1 "First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards". The new structure of IFRS 1 is intended in particular to more easily accommodate future amendments to this Standard, as well as to simplify its application. The new version of this Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In January 2009, the IFRIC published Interpretation IFRIC 18 "Transfers of Assets from Customers", which provides additional guidance on how to account for transfers of assets from customers. IFRIC 18 clarifies the requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an

104

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant, and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services. The Interpretation must be applied for financial years beginning after 31 October 2009. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In April 2009, the IASB published the second collection of amendments to IFRSs: "Improvements to IFRSs 2009". A total of fifteen minor amendments were made to ten existing Standards and two Interpretations. Unless otherwise set forth in the relevant standard, the amendments are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The application of the amendments has no material impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In June 2009, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment ­ Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions", to clarify how an individual subsidiary in a group should account for group cash-settled share-based payment arrangements in its own financial statements. The amendments to IFRS 2 also incorporate guidance previously included in IFRIC 8 "Scope of IFRS 2" and IFRIC 11 "IFRS 2--Group and Treasury Share Transactions". The amended Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.

· In July 2009, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 1 "Additional Exemptions for Firsttime Adopters". The amendments relate to the retrospective application of IFRSs for entities in the oil and gas industry in special situations. They are intended to ensure that the entities do not incur disproportionately high expenses in their transition to IFRSs. The new version of this Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In October 2009, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation". The amendment governs the accounting by the issuer for rights issues, options and warrants denominated in a currency other than the issuer's functional currency. The amended Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 February 2010. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In November 2009, the IFRIC published the Interpretation IFRIC 19 "Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments". This Interpretation clarifies the requirements of IFRSs, when an entity renegotiates the terms and conditions of a financial liability with the creditor and the creditor accepts these, that the financial liability is extinguished in full or in part with shares or other equity instruments of the entity. The Interpretation must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The application of the

105

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In January 2010, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 1 "Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters". The amendments exempt firsttime adopters of IFRSs from the requirement to provide the comparative prior-period information required by the March 2009 amendments to IFRS 7. This amendment is intended to ensure that first-time adopters benefit from the transitional provisions of the amended IFRS 7. The new version of this Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The application of the amended version of the Standard has no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In May 2010, the IASB published the third collection of amendments to IFRSs: "Improvements to IFRSs 2010". Minor amendments were made to eight Standards and one Interpretation. Unless otherwise set forth in the relevant standard, the amendments are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The amendments to IFRS 3 "Business Combinations", IAS 21 "The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates", IAS 28 "Investments in Associates" and IAS 31 "Interests in Joint Ventures" are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The application of the amendments has no material impact on the presentation of the financial statements.

The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued by the IASB and the IFRIC and adopted by the European Union, but were not applied in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2011 because they were not yet applicable for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2010:
· In November 2009, the IASB published a revised version of IAS 24 "Related Party Disclosures". The revised version simplifies the disclosure requirements for governmentrelated entities and clarifies the definition of a related party. The amended Standard must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The application of the revised version of the Standard has no material impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
· In October 2010, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures". The amendments allow users of financial statements to improve their understanding of transfer transactions of financial assets. The amendments must be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. The application of the revised version of the Standard has no material impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
At present, BVB cannot definitively assess the impacts that the first-time adoption of these Standards, amendments to Standards or amendments to the Interpretations will have.

CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES
The annual financial statements of the companies included in BVB's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, using consistent accounting policies.
The end of the reporting period for the consolidated financial statements is the end of the reporting period of the parent company.
Intercompany revenues, income and expenses, and all receivables and liabilities between companies included in the consolidated financial statements are eliminated on consolidation.
A subsidiary is generally any company over which the parent has the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities (controlled entity). The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether one entity has control over another entity. Subsidiaries are generally included in the consolidated financial statements (full consolidation) from the date on which control is transferred.
Acquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition cost is equal to the fair value of the assets given, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities incurred or assumed on the date of the transaction. The costs associated with the acquisition are recognised as

an expense. When consolidated for the first time, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair values, regardless of the size of the minority interest.
Any excess of the acquisition cost over the share of equity acquired at fair value is recognised as goodwill. If the acquisition costs are lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the measurement of net assets is reviewed and the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Minority interests represent the share of net assets that is not attributable to the Group. These are reported separately in consolidated equity and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes in interest where control is retained are accounted for as equity transactions between controlling and minority owners and recognised outside of profit or loss.
Associates over which the Group has a significant but not a controlling influence are accounted for using the equity method and initially recognised at cost. The Group's share of profits and losses of associates is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date of acquisition, while the share of changes in reserves is reflected in consolidated reserves. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes since the date of

108

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

acquisition. There were no unrealised gains at any date from transactions between Group companies and associates which would have been required to be eliminated on consolidation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. The euro is the currency of the primary business environment (functional currency) of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements. In the single-entity financial statements of the parent and of the consolidated subsidiaries, business transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on the fulfilment of such transactions and on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities carried in foreign currencies using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.

Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation based on their expected useful lives or at the lower recoverable amount. Player registrations reported in these financial statements are measured at cost, taking into account the FIFA Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players contained in circular no. 769 of 24 August 2001 which came into force on 21 September 2001, and are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the term of the individual contracts for professional players. The cost of player registrations includes transfer payments made and the costs of advisers directly attributable to the particular transfer.
Computer software for commercial and technical applications is amortised on a straight-line basis over three years.
The useful life and the method of amortisation are reviewed at least at the end of each financial year.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are presented below. The policies described were applied consistently for the reporting periods shown, unless otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on amortised cost. However, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.

Property, plant and equipment The SIGNAL IDUNA PARK stadium buildings were measured at their fair value amounting to EUR 177,200 thousand in the opening IFRS statement of financial position as at 1 July 2004, in accordance with the option permitted by IFRS 1.16. This valuation is based on the opinion of an independent external expert. The carrying amount of the stadium buildings in the statement of financial position represents the carrying amount as at 1 July 2004 less depreciation charged subsequently.

109

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

Land, the other buildings and the remaining items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less depreciation. Repair and main-

tenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as expenses in the current period.

Straight-line depreciation is based on the following useful lives:
Stadium Other buildings Technical equipment and machinery Other equipment, operating and office equipment

Useful life in years 30
20 to 50 4,5 to 15
7 to 15

The useful life and the method of amortisation are reviewed at least at the end of each financial year. Significant parts of the stadium building are depreciated over their respective specific useful lives (component approach).

Impairment testing The useful lives of intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment are all finite. If there are specific indications of possible impairment, individual assets are tested for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value in use. If the reason for an impairment write-down recognised in prior years no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed until the carrying amount of the asset, net of depreciation and amortisation, equals the amount that would have been determined if an impairment loss had not been recognised. There were no indications of impairment in financial year 2010/2011.

Leases The Group's leases relate in particular to developed land, operating and office equipment as the lessee.
Leased assets in respect of which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group (finance lease) are recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments or at the lower fair value in accordance with IAS 17 and depreciated over the useful life or the shorter lease term. In the case of leases of land and buildings, the components of the land and buildings are considered separately for the purpose of the classification of the leases.
The payment obligations resulting from finance lease agreements are recognised as a liability.

110

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

The lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the element representing the repayment of the remaining liability in such a way that a constant rate of interest is charged on the outstanding lease obligation over the period of the lease (effective interest method). Interest charges are expensed immediately. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor (operating lease), the lease payments are recognised as an expense in the financial year.
Financial instruments Financial instruments under IFRS are classified in line with the format of the statement of financial position. The table under Note 22 provides a reconciliation of the individual classes and categories of IAS 39 to the items of the statement of financial position and the fair values of the financial instruments disclosed therein.
The financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are allocated to one of the following categories, depending on their nature: "loans and receivables" or "available-for-sale financial assets". As a rule, financial assets are recognised at fair value upon initial recognition. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. The amount recognised in the statement of financial position is equal to the maximum exposure to credit risk. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification:

a) Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets which are either directly allocated to this category or which cannot be allocated to any of the other categories. Available-forsale financial assets are subsequently remeasured at fair value outside profit or loss. If there is no quoted price in an active market and fair value cannot be reliably measured, these financial assets are measured at amortised cost.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised outside profit or loss in equity, taking into account deferred tax assets and liabilities. Gains and losses are not realised until the financial asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Company did not hold any such financial instruments as at the end of the reporting period.
b) Loans and receivables Borrowings and receivables are classified as "loans and receivables". These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If their maturities are less than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, they are reported under current assets. Otherwise, they are reported as non-current assets. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

111

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

For financial assets carried at amortised cost, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.
Impairment of financial assets At the end of every reporting period, it is assessed whether there is any objective evidence, such as non-payment or default, that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if their carrying amounts exceed their expected future recoverable amounts. For financial assets or groups of financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment to be recognised equals the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or group of financial assets and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. An impairment triggers a direct reduction of the carrying amounts of all financial assets affected, with the exception of trade receivables, whose carrying amounts are reduced via an allowance account. If a trade receivable is deemed to be uncollectible, this allowance account is used to recognise the impairment. Subsequent collections of amounts already written down are also booked against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss under "Other operating expenses".

Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. The latter case is deemed to have occurred when all significant risks and rewards associated with ownership of the asset have been transferred or when the control over the asset has been relinquished.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation underlying this liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. In cases where an existing financial liability is exchanged against another financial liability of the same lender with substantially different terms and conditions or if the terms and conditions of an existing liability are materially modified, such exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. Any difference between the relevant carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset against one another and the net balance is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position if an entity a) has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Deferred taxes Deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the IFRS financial statements (liability method). However, if in the course of a transaction which is not a business combination a deferred tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss, the deferred tax asset or liability is neither recognised at the date of initial recognition nor afterwards.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax laws adopted by the Bundestag and Bundesrat as at the end of the reporting period using a rate of income tax of 32.2% (previous year: 32.2%).
Inventories Inventories consist principally of merchandising articles and goods held by the subsidiary company BVB Merchandising GmbH. Inventories are measured at cost less any individual allowances for goods whose cost may not be recoverable.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are also recognised for tax loss carry-forwards that can be utilised in subsequent periods, provided it is sufficiently probable that the deferred tax asset will be recoverable.
Deferred taxes relating to items recognised outside profit or loss are also recognised outside profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted against each other where the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.

Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash on hand, cheques and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are shortterm, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash or convertible to a known amount of cash within a period of less than three months and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Treasury shares The full amount paid for the purchase of treasury shares is reported as an item deducted from equity. The Company has the right to reissue treasury shares purchased by it at a later date. Proceeds of resale in excess of cost are added to capital reserves, while shortfalls are taken to revenue reserves.

113

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

Provisions and contingent liabilities In accordance with IAS 37, provisions are recognised where a present obligation exists to third parties arising from a past event, which is expected to result in an outflow of resources and whose amount can be reliably estimated. No provisions have been reported in these consolidated financial statements because it was possible to determine the amount and timing of all obligations with sufficient certainty, with the result that these obligations have been reported under liabilities.
Contingent liabilities which do not meet the criteria for recognition as a provision are disclosed in the notes, unless the probability of an obligation occurring is remote.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities falling under the scope of IAS 39 are allocated to the category "other financial liabilities". These include borrowings and are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, where interest expense is measured in accordance with the effective interest rate. Please refer to Notes 9, 10 and 20 et seq. for information on the provision of collateral and further disclosures on financial liabilities.

Prepaid expenses and deferred income Prepaid expenses and deferred income are recognised and apportioned on a straight-line basis over their term to allocate payments made on an accrual basis.
Recognition of income and expenses Revenues are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the receivable or consideration received and represent amounts for goods delivered and services provided in the ordinary course of business, less rebates, VAT and other taxes arising in relation to revenues.
Admission fees and other match day-related income (such as income from catering) are recognised on the match day. Sponsorship and licensing income are apportioned on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant agreements; TV income and other components of the DFL TV agreement are recognised over the duration of the football season. Income from merchandising is recognised when the merchandise has been delivered, the risks and rewards incident to ownership have been transferred and it is likely that the economic benefits will flow to the acquirer.
Interest income and expenses are allocated to the period to which they relate, taking into account the outstanding amount of the loan and the effective

114

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

interest rate to be applied. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
Operating expenses are recognised when the goods or services are utilised or at the date the expenses are incurred.
Revenue In accordance with the classification prescribed by the German Football League (Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, "DFL") for the licensing procedure, income from the sale of transfer rights for player registrations is reported under revenue at the date on which the match authorisation expires. The expenses associated with the transfer activities such as the book values of assets sold and incidental costs of disposal are reported as other operating expenses.
MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS
The Group finances itself primarily from longterm bank loans, finance leases, trade payables, season tickets paid for in advance and payments from sponsors. The related risks arising comprise interest-rate-related cash flow risks, market risks, liquidity risks and credit risks. On

the other hand, the Group is not exposed to any significant currency risks. The methods of managing the individual types of risk are described in the following.
Interest rate risks The Group's financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period consist mainly of fixed-interest loans. The Group is exposed to interest rate risks from 2013 onwards based on variable-rate loans; appropriate interest rate hedges have been entered into to hedge these risks. Risk Controll uses appropriate tools and methods to constantly monitor interest rate risk, and reports regularly to the management on current events. The objective of the risk strategy is to limit or eliminate interest rate risks. The strategy explicitly calls for the use of appropriate derivative financial instruments to hedge risks.
Sensitivity analysis (interest rate risk) All interest rate swaps and variable-interest loans were included in the sensitivity analysis; by contrast, fixed-rate loans were not included in the analysis, since these did not result in interest rate risk exposure.
In the event the interest rate were to fall by 100 basis points (parallel shift in the yield curve), equity would decrease by EUR 1,056 thousand and consolidated comprehensive income would fall by EUR 21 thousand.

115

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

In the event the interest rate were to rise by 100 basis points (parallel shift in the yield curve), equity would increase by EUR 912 thousand and consolidated comprehensive income would rise by EUR 20 thousand.
Credit risk The Group conducts business exclusively with third parties of high credit standing. Concentrations of credit risk can arise in the context of a player transfer and from long-term sponsorship agreements. Such concentrations of risk are monitored in the course of the Group's operating activities.
The maximum credit risk in the event of counterparty default is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. Please refer to Note 20.
Liquidity risk The Group constantly monitors the risk of possible liquidity bottlenecks, taking into account the probable maturities of its financial liabilities and the timing of the expected cash flows from operating activities. The Group counters potential liquidity risk by taking up largely long-term financing. Appropriate corporate planning is used to constantly monitor short-term financing components. Please refer to Note 21 for information on the maturities of contractual cash flows.

SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS SUBJECT TO JUDGEMENT AND ESTIMATES
The collectibility of trade receivables is assessed based on the estimated probability of default. Specific valuation allowances are calculated for overdue receivables using individually determined percentages. In the event that the financial situations of our partners worsen, the amounts actually written down may exceed the amount of the valuation allowances recognised. This could negatively impact the results of operations. Please refer to Note 5 for information on carrying amounts.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available to enable the loss carry-forwards actually to be utilised. In order to determine the amount of the deferred tax assets required to be recognised in this context, management makes significant assumptions with respect to the expected timing and amount of future taxable income. As at 30 June 2011, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forwards amounted to EUR 4,269 thousand (30 June 2010: EUR 6,165 thousand). Please refer to Note 18 for further information.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of judgement. All decisions requiring the use of judgement are reassessed on a permanent basis and are based on past experience and expectations as to future events that appear reasonable, given the current circumstances.

OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group applies IFRS 8, which calls for the use of the "management approach" for purposes of reporting on the economic development of segments. Segment information is determined and calculated in the same manner as is done for the purposes of internal reporting to the management ("chief operating decision maker").
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity's chief operating decision makers to assess its performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and for

which discrete financial information is available through internal reporting.
The Group has two reportable segments, which are responsible for the main activities of the overall Group. The first segment consists of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA, which operates a football club including a professional football team and leverages the associated revenue potential arising from the transfer of players, catering, TV marketing, sponsorship and ticketing. The second segment consists of the separate merchandising business, which is carried out by BVB Merchandising GmbH, a legally independent entity. Internal reporting is based on the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) applicable to each company.

Income from TV marketing amounted to EUR 26,775 thousand (previous year: EUR 20,196 thousand), and thus exceeded the 10% threshold for a single customer set forth in IFRS 8.34. This was due to the fact that the Bundesliga's TV rights are centrally marketed by DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH.

Derivative financial instruments Management entered into six interest rate swap transactions with German Landesbanken (i.e. banks local to Germany's individual states or "Länder") with respect to credit facilities having fixed-interest rates expiring in 2013 and 2016 in order to lock in the low interest rates over the medium to long term and hedge the risk of changes in cash flows due to changing interest rates. The notional amount and the related fair value are as follows:

EUR '000
Interest rate swaps of which pay-fixed swaps

30/06/2011 Nominal amount Market value

28,043

352

In accordance with IFRS 7.27 B, interest rate swaps are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy since the input parameters used for measurement (yield curves) are observable on the market. The Group does not make its own estimates or assumptions for fair value measurement.
The banks have already approved credit facilities with terms extending until 2021 and 2026; these financial liabilities will also be hedged. The interest rate swaps are measured at fair value by discounting the expected future cash flows. The measurement results are substantiated by bank calculations.
Highly probable forecast transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges (micro hedging). The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives amounted to EUR 344 thousand in the period, and is recognised directly in equity (other comprehensive income) after deducting deferred

taxes. The ineffective portion amounted to EUR 8 thousand and is recognised immediately in profit or loss. If a hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same period(s) in which the financial asset or liability (the hedged item) affects profit or loss. The hedging instrument parameters are established based on the assumption that the forecast transaction will occur. The derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps employed by the Borussia Dortmund Group for hedging purposes are economically effective hedges. Changes in the market values of the derivatives are offset by compensating changes in the value of the hedged underlyings, which are demonstrated through effectiveness calculations.
During the reporting period, there were no reclassifications from OCI to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The completion of the third phase of construction (functional buildings and football pitches) resulted in a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment subject to finance leases and in the liabilities from finance leases. There is a purchase option for the entire property after the expiry of the lease term in 2022, based on the residual value of the lessor's financing.

In the period between the date of admission of the Company's shares to trading (31/10/2000) and the end of the reporting period, the Company acquired a total of 34,000 no-par value shares and sold 12,804 no-par value shares off-market in the form of printed physical share certificates. At the end of the reporting period, the Company's holding of its own securities consisted of 21,196 no-par value shares. This represented 0.035% of the share capital. The general partner is authorised until 29 November 2015, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital by a maximum of EUR 30,712,500.00 in total by issuing new no-par value ordinary bearer

shares against cash and/or in-kind contributions on one or more occasions (Authorised Capital 2010).
Reserves Capital reserves consist exclusively of transfers in respect of premiums on the issue of new shares after deducting the net costs of the placement and the Company's share of revenues from the sale of treasury shares.
Other revenue reserves comprise profits generated and not distributed by Group companies in the current year and previous years and accumulated

losses. In addition, the net effect, taking account of subsequent adjustments, of the remeasurement of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK in accordance with IFRS 1.16 is reported under this item.
Capital management The objective of capital management is to ensure the Group's long-term ability to function on a going concern basis and to generate appropriate returns

for shareholders. Debt management steers the raising of debt, particularly with regard to financing with matching maturities. The capital structure is managed in such a way that changes in macroeconomic conditions and risks arising from the underlying assets are taken into account. Shortterm target-performance comparisons and medium- and long-term financial planning are used in the capital structure management process.

The capital structure at the end of the reporting period was as follows:

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

The conditions for a fixed-interest loan for a nominal amount of EUR 20,000 thousand with a term until June 2013 include covenants relating to the consolidated equity ratio and the interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/interest expense) in the consolidated financial statements.
In addition, covenants are in place in relation to an overdraft facility for EUR 5,000 thousand. These covenants include the equity ratio, net debt/EBITDA and the interest coverage ratio. The covenants are reviewed on an annual basis. As at the end of the reporting period, all covenants were complied with.
The other current and non-current liabilities to banks consist of a number of loans repayable in instalments. The loans have terms expiring between 2020 and 2026.
Non-current financial liabilities have a weighted interest rate of 6.2% (previous year: 6.6%); cur-

rent financial liabilities have a weighted interest rate of 6.9% (previous year: 7.7%).
As a result of the existing fixed-interest periods applying to all loans and interest hedges for non-current obligations, the BVB Group is not exposed to any significant risk from changes in interest rates, even in the medium and long term.
Pledged collateral: Items of property, plant and equipment with a residual carrying amount of EUR 133,790 thousand (30 June 2010: EUR 140,013 thousand) have been mortgaged as collateral for financial liabilities.
As in the previous year, future claims, not reflected in the financial statements, from season ticket sales, transfer income and insurance receivables, were assigned.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

At the end of the reporting period, the Group had corporation tax loss carry-forwards amounting to EUR 149,574 thousand (previous year: EUR 156,995 thousand) and trade tax loss carry-forwards amounting to EUR 155,513 thousand (previous year: EUR 157,719 thousand) for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised. The likelihood that these carry-forwards will be used is assessed on the basis of a four-year plan factoring in this year's qualification for the UEFA Champions League and the resulting increase in revenue, as

well as consistent athletic successes in the form of participation in international competitions over the planning period. The average tax rate was 32.2%, as in the previous year. The expected income tax expense which would theoretically result from applying the weighted average tax rate of 32.2% (previous year: 32.2%) can be reconciled with the actual income tax benefit reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:

EUR '000

Due to their short residual terms, the carrying amounts reported for current trade receivables and payables and cash are roughly equivalent to their fair values.

Non-current trade receivables and liabilities are discounted to present value and accrue interest. In these cases, the carrying amounts largely correspond to fair value.

136

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from 1 July 2010 until 30 June 2011

The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities is measured using the discounted cash flow valuation technique. The discount rates used were taken from the "Yields on listed Federal securities" as published by the Bundesbank at the end of the reporting period, plus a risk premium.

The discount rates valid at the end of the reporting period had matching maturities and formed the basis of the valuation model.

(25) Earnings per share

Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings Per Share) by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to the shareholders of the parent by the weighted aver-

age number of shares outstanding. Earnings per share relate only to shares in the parent company. Since there are no potential ordinary shares, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.

The general partner in Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA is Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH. The latter is responsible for the management and legal representation of Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA. The power to appoint and remove members of staff thus rests with BV. Borussia 09 e.V., Dortmund, in its capacity as the sole shareholder in Borussia Dortmund Geschäftsführungs-GmbH. Both Borussia Dortmund Ge-

(29) Events after the end of the reporting period
Borussia Dortmund was pleased to welcome three new Champion Partners in July and August of 2011. Borussia Dortmund succeeded in acquiring Wilo, the world's leading high-tech pump manufacturer located in Dortmund, as a new Champion Partner. Wilo already has a tradition of involvement with Borussia Dortmund, as SIGNAL IDUNA PARK is fully equipped with Wilo products.
Borussia Dortmund's second new Champion partner is Yanmar, a manufacturer of industrial engines as well as agricultural and construction machinery headquartered in Osaka, Japan. This partnership is of particular interest to Yanmar owing to BVB professional Shinji Kagawa, whose football roots are with Cerezo Osaka, of which Yanmar has been the main sponsor for some time.
Another new Champion Partner of Borussia Dortmund is Q-Cells, a globally leading photovoltaics company.
After a good showing in the preseason (including beating out Mainz 05, Hamburger SV and Bayern München to win the T-Home Cup), Coach Jürgen Klopp's team started the regular season with a clear 3:0 win in the first round of the DFB-Cup at an away game against third-division team SV Sandhausen.

For the following round in October, Borussia Dortmund drew a home game at SIGNAL IDUNA PARK against second-division team Dynamo Dresden.

Borussia Dortmund then started the 2011/2012 Bundesliga season with a heated 3:1 win over Hamburger SV. The opening game of the current German champion was viewed by football fans in 199 countries all over the world. The season started well on the whole as the young team followed a 0:1 loss in their first away game at TSG Hoffenheim with a 2:0 victory against 1. FC Nürnberg on match day 3.

Participation in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League is yet another step for Borussia Dortmund on the way to international success. The drawing for the Champions League group stage held on 25 August 2011 in Monaco has provided the team with a challenge, having set it against some interesting and strong opponents in European professional football.

AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, Dortmund ­ consisting of the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and notes ­ as well as the Group management report for the financial year from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the EU and the additional requirements of commercial law to be applied under § 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, "HGB") as well as the supplementary provisions in the Articles of Association is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report, based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [in Deutschland] (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the relevant financial reporting standards and in the Group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the

Group and expectations of possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the internal accounting control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes the assessment of the annual financial statements of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements, the definition of the group of consolidated companies, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the legal representatives, as well as the evaluation of the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted in the EU and the additional requirements of commercial law to be applied under § 315a (1) HGB as well as the supplementary provisions in the Articles of Association and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The Group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, provides as a whole a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
