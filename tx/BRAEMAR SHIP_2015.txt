One group. Stronger and better balanced

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016

Braemar operates across the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance sectors. We play a critical role in providing skills and knowledge in markets dominated by uncertain macro-economic factors. We face challenges arising from a lower level of oil and gas exploration, changes in global trade patterns and oversupplied shipping markets. Our diversified portfolio of businesses and active management strategy has enabled us to deliver a solid performance in the face of tough markets.
Results for the year Revenue for the year increased by 9% to г159.1 million (2015: г145.6 million) and underlying operating profit from continuing operations by 19% to г13.8 million (2015: г11.5 million). Underlying earnings per share were 34.7 pence compared with 32.3 pence last year and fulfils our expectation of enhancement in the first full year following the merger with ACM.
The Shipbroking division performed strongly during the year. Our breadth of services ensured that we were able to capitalise on the rise in activity in the tanker markets driven by increased oil production and tonne miles. The offshore and dry bulk shipping markets were weak and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. However we have already taken action to ensure we are appropriately structured for these conditions. Our total forward order book remains strong and is currently US$49 million, of which approximately US$26 million relates to 2016/17.
The businesses within our Technical division overall performed as expected. As previously reported, the continuing impact of low oil prices affected our Offshore businesses. However this was offset by a strong performance in our Engineering business, which is a market leader in the provision of LNG engineering services.
Our Logistics division reported a lower level of profitability, but invested to expand the business in the UK and USA and won new work which we expect will generate positive returns in the future.

Dividend The Directors are recommending, for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 2016, an unchanged final dividend of 17 pence per share.
This dividend will be paid on 29 July 2016 to those on the register at close of business on 1 July 2016. Together with the 9 pence interim dividend, the Company's dividend for the year of 26 pence (2015: 26 pence) will be covered 1.3 times (2015: 1.2 times) by earnings from underlying operations.
Colleagues Braemar is a people business and it is the hard work, commitment and enthusiasm of our staff that continue to deliver our business performance. As always, the Board would like to recognise and thank everyone in the Group for their untiring efforts to establish and maintain Braemar as a valued provider of knowledge based services to the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets across the globe.
Outlook Our diversified portfolio of businesses has again put us in a strong position to handle the volatility of the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets during the years ahead. We anticipate that our markets will continue to experience volatility and uncertainty, but that the balance of our portfolio creates greater stability which will enable us to continue to build the business.
Much has been achieved during recent years and I am encouraged by our continuing good progress. While there are likely to be market swings which affect our individual businesses, overall we expect the Group to achieve a broadly similar level of activity in the coming year. Over the longer term we remain confident for the prospects of our diversified Group and will look to continue to grow our businesses both organically and by acquisition.
David Moorhouse CBE, FNI Chairman 13 May 2016

Board and management I was delighted to succeed Sir Graham Hearne as Chairman of the Group at the AGM in June 2015. We also welcomed Louise Evans to the Board, succeeding Martin Beer as Group Finance Director in June 2015.

Enhancing growth potential

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016

Trading performance Braemar is a diversified group operating in the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets. After a year of significant change in 2014/15, I am pleased to report this year's results which demonstrate the success of our ongoing strategy to diversify and grow the business. The results show we made encouraging progress with revenue increasing by г13.5 million to г159.1 million and underlying operating profit increasing by г2.3 million to г13.8 million.
Revenue in our Shipbroking division increased by г17.1 million to г70.7 million and underlying operating profit by г4.1 million to г9.7 million. This growth was the result of the success of our merger with ACM last year where we created a stronger and larger business. Individual shipping markets have performed with highly differential results and we have benefited from the strong tanker markets where we have a larger presence. Volatility in these sectors has enhanced the demand for our broking services as clients seek to protect their market exposure. The Dry Bulk and Offshore markets were universally weak but we have ensured that all areas are appropriately structured for these market conditions.
The Technical division met our expectations with revenue increasing significantly by г4.6 million to г54.3 million, but underlying operating profit fell by г1.1 million to г5.2 million. The division includes a mix of businesses facing different market dynamics, and while certain business units have suffered from the falling oil price and slowdown in Asia, others have seen increased project activity.
Revenue in the Logistics division fell by г8.2 million to г34.1 million reflecting a lower level of freight forwarding business. Underlying operating profit also fell by г0.7 million in the year to г1.6 million. This was largely due to the set-up costs of our new office in Houston and the lead time to the start of new contracts. The profitability of the freight forwarding and bespoke projects departments was also affected by delays to specific infrastructure projects in the UK. Notwithstanding these factors, the division has laid the foundations for future growth and the early signs of recovery are underway.

Strategic developments Our objective remains to build the Braemar Group as the most valued provider of knowledge and skill-based services to the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets on a global basis. As we have built our three divisions in recent years we have created a global presence that provides us with a strong platform to add to our teams and existing businesses to achieve this.
Our Executive Committee meets regularly to explore opportunities to grow the Braemar Group and identify ways to enhance our three divisions. We continue to seek opportunities to expand either by acquisition or by developing our business organically. To this end we have recently concluded a structured refinancing arrangement with HSBC bank that will make up to г30 million available for future business development.
We invested in information technology and infrastructure across our offices during the year in order to better support the Group. We continued to roll out a common accounting system across all divisions and, once completed, our global Group will operate across a common accounting platform. This will enable an improved ability to share information across the Group and make it easier to bolt on or establish new enterprises.
We increased the resource for developing and training our staff to ensure there is career development and effective succession in place in all areas of the Group.
At the end of 2015, we relocated our two Technical London offices into a single location and fitted out the office to be consistent with our corporate brand. We have four hub offices in London, Singapore, Houston and Melbourne from which we will continue to build the Braemar Group.
I am very pleased with the progress the Group made during the year and believe that we can continue to develop the Group further. I am looking forward to working with the staff and leadership team to move into the next phase of Braemar's development.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Business model Braemar provides expert market knowledge and professional skills and advice to clients in the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets. We do this through a global network of consistently trusted and commonly branded businesses. We focus on providing technical and practical knowledge, advice and services. Our income is generated through commissions, project fees or timebased charges for expertise.
Our clients are the owners and users of vessels, insurers and major energy companies which engage in significant projects, where our knowledge and skill can add or protect significant value. We aim to build long-term relationships with these clients so they understand and trust in what we can do for them. Each segment of our portfolio of businesses has specialised knowledge and skills but they are complementary and often service the same client. Clients receive the same standards of service from all areas of the Group, which reinforces the value of the global brand. "Braemar" is about expertise, trust, reliability, integrity, respectability and being ethically sound.
We are increasingly investing in the recruitment, training and development of the people in the business. We also invest in technology to benefit from shared knowledge and skills across the Group and we look for opportunities to streamline support systems and reduce costs. We allocate capital to the differing segments in which we operate, depending on where we perceive them to be in their economic cycle and by making value enhancing acquisitions.
Our assets are our people, their client relationships, our reputation and our corporate brand. The cash that we generate is used for rewarding our staff based on the value they deliver, investing in new teams or businesses and to providers of finance, especially dividends to our shareholders. Our equity listing enables us to reward staff with deferred equity which aligns their interests with our shareholders, as well as raising capital to make acquisitions when opportunities arise.

Current portfolio drivers Shipbroking The Shipbroking business is driven by the number of ship transactions we conclude and the value of those transactions. The volume of seaborne trade has increased steadily over many years and has driven significant growth in the volume of shipping business. Individual market segments are influenced by the demand for commodities and other seaborne cargoes and the supply of suitable vessels, the US$/г exchange rate and the price of fuel for ships (the bunker price). We are represented in most market segments which helps balance individual market volatility. Most of our income is denominated in US dollars.
Technical The portfolio of Technical businesses services the shipping, marine, energy, offshore and insurance markets. Sustained growth in global trade and energy provision is therefore a long-term driver for all segments in this portfolio. However, short-term fluctuations will affect each of the segments differently. Oil and gas exploration is sensitive to the oil price. Our engineering consultancy services to the LNG market is driven by investment in new projects and an increasing trend towards the use of cleaner fuels. Much of our insurance work relates to infrastructure damage caused by bad weather or by restrictions on repairs and maintenance budgets.
Logistics Our Logistics business is largely driven by the level of UK import/export business, although we have increased our activities in other geographies especially the Far East and the USA.

The Shipbroking division reported strong growth with revenue up 32% on the prior year at г70.7 million and underlying profits up 73% at г9.7 million. This reflects the success of our July 2014 merger to form Braemar ACM Shipbroking.

in supply also allowed contangos to develop which created an incentive for oil traders to store oil, increasing the levels of land-based storage and leading to some discharge delays and a reduction in available tonnage.

Deep Sea Tankers The Deep Sea crude oil and refined product desks operate predominantly out of London and Singapore with teams in Mumbai, Dubai, Connecticut and Houston. The teams delivered a strong performance in 2015/16 driven by increased oil production which stimulated demand for tankers and served to increase freight rates to levels not experienced since 2008.
The fall in oil prices continues to support global demand for oil. Crude oil trade surged during 2015 as refineries increased activity to meet demand for transport fuels and petrochemical feedstock. This increased consumption of oil and the demand for seaborne crude particularly stimulated the VLCC market. The global rise in supply of oil led to increased competition for tonnage which was further enhanced as Far Eastern countries diversified their crude intake from the Middle East to include the Atlantic Basin producers, thus increasing tonne miles and keeping freight rates strong. The rise

Despite China's economic slowdown, it continued to fill its strategic petroleum reserves. The market also benefited from relatively low growth in the global tanker fleet with a small number of new ships coming into the market. However ship owners also chose to defer demolition of other vessels to capitalise on the strong freight rates.
The strong spot market had a positive effect on the long-term period charter market and the freight futures market and our experienced teams were able to help clients in managing their exposure to volatile freight markets.
The fall in oil prices also boosted clean product demand globally, particularly in developing countries that lacked the refining infrastructure to meet their own product needs. Importantly, having started 2014 significantly underutilised, the world's refineries were able to meet this new demand. Rising demand was supported by rising average voyage duration.

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016

18/19
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

For 2016/17 the market looks to remain uncertain. Low crude oil prices and longer voyage distances are expected to continue which may drive further growth in demand, but this could be offset by the effect of the delivery of new ships and an expected low level of demolition. With the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran, more Iranian crude oil volumes are expected but the effect on the market is unclear and may be offset by the utilisation of Iranian-owned crude tankers in the international market.
Specialised Tankers Specialised Tankers covers the transportation of LNG, LPG, petrochemical gases, chemicals and smaller parcels of products. In 2015/16 each of the teams performed well and delivered growth performances.
The LNG and LPG markets have experienced overall fleet growth during recent years, with investment in VLGCs leading expansion. This growth in fleet size has generated an oversupply of freight against a lack of worldwide demand which has resulted in low rates in the spot market and a diminishing need for time charters.
Offshore Our Offshore desk operates out of London, Aberdeen, Singapore and Houston. 2015/16 was a tough year with exploration activity significantly curtailed as major oil companies sought cost reductions. Reduced exploration activity led to decreased demand for vessels while supply increased as time-charter contracts came to an end resulting in a reduction in spot rates. It is likely that these market conditions will continue until we see a period of higher and more stable oil prices stimulating new exploration activity. Against this challenging backdrop, our Offshore team performed well to deliver a profitable performance.

Dry Bulk The Dry Bulk desk operates from offices in Australia, London, Singapore, India and China. Despite increased transaction volumes, 2015/16 was one of the poorest Dry Cargo freight markets on record due to the oversupply of tonnage combined with weaker commodity demand. This was largely driven by the slowdown in the growth rate in China where iron ore and coal demand remains a significant influence on the Capesize market. Cape rates reached lows not experienced since the mid 1980s.
Going into 2016/17, the projected volume of new ships coming into the market is expected to put further pressure on the current imbalance between oversupply of tonnage and dry bulk demand. The full unwind of excess supply is likely to take some time and an increase in layup and demolition for the older vessels will be needed to correct the imbalance. In recent weeks freight rates have recovered somewhat, as measured by the increase in the Baltic Dry Index from its historic low in February 2016, and we are seeing increasing interest for investment in the sector.
Nevertheless, market weakness presents opportunities to build our business and we are selectively hiring experienced brokers to build our global reach in the Dry Bulk sector.
Sale and Purchase Our sale and purchase team operates out of London, Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai. The team achieved a strong performance with secondhand activity in the Dry Cargo market particularly strong. This was predominantly driven by the oversupply of tonnage and pressure on ship owners to sell. However, the opposite was true in the Tanker market as higher charter rates limited owners' desire to sell vessels.

The shipping markets are subject to regulation to standardise best practice, preserve the marine environment and reduce global warming gas emissions. We anticipate that the increased regulation will lead to more investment in fleet renewal and an acceleration of demolition of certain ships which will be replaced with new designs. However the timing of this activity is currently uncertain.

The division reported revenue up 9% on the prior year at г54.3 million, mainly as a result of strong growth in Braemar Engineering. Operating profit at г5.2 million was lower reflecting margin pressure and lower activity in the Offshore market.
Braemar Offshore The fall in oil price resulted in markedly lower exploration and construction activities in the offshore energy sector as oil companies seek to reduce their own costs. A number of forecast large projects have either been shelved or delayed and many existing projects have been scaled down. Despite the challenging market environment, Braemar Offshore performed relatively well due to a pro-active approach to retain existing business and by expanding its service offering. The highly skilled and versatile staff employed across the eight offices in the Far East region have been key to this.

Braemar Engineering Braemar Engineering continued to benefit from its market-leading position in the LNG sector and reported a strong result in 2015/16 based on both marine and shorebased LNG consulting for longterm investment programmes. The team in the UK progressed with a major three-year project for the design, site supervision and crew training for six LNG ("liquefied natural gas") carrier newbuildings. The project has now delivered five of the six vessels with the final vessel due for completion in mid-2016. The office in Houston has also seen solid growth from its involvement in a significant project aimed at supplying LNG to vessels for use as bunker fuel. At the end of 2015, we announced our exclusive involvement in the development of a new cost-effective technology for the containment of LNG.

Braemar Adjusting Braemar Adjusting was also affected by reduced activity in the oil and gas sector. Output from the four US shale basins declined with construction projects and major field development being postponed or experiencing significant regulatory delay. The active worldwide drilling fleet also reduced significantly during the last year, impacting all oil & gas service industries. However, over the last few years management took several strategic decisions which have helped build and shelter the business. These were to establish a strong presence in the Middle East, expand North American operations and to diversify the business to include refining, petrochemical, power and mining as well as upstream oil and gas. The business continues to recruit and develop staff and focus on growing its market share through the current market cycle to position the business for the future.

Braemar Howells Despite the challenges faced in most marine and offshore oil sectors, Braemar Howells operated at a similar activity level to the prior year and achieved a higher operating profit due to cost savings flowing from a restructuring at the end of the previous financial year. The results benefited from a number of projects including a project to handle bitumen and the removal of the wreck of a vessel off the Pembrokeshire Coast. The business prides itself on the core skill of providing a 24/7 global incident response service, applying the Company's specialist knowledge and expertise as required. The International arm of the business currently operates in West and Central Africa, providing environmental consultancy and the hire of offshore drilling oil spill support packages.

Braemar incorporating the Salvage Association Braemar incorporating the Salvage Association performed well in the year against a backdrop of fewer casualty claims. Although the number of surveys undertaken was lower than the previous year an increase in the number of consultancy assignments, project cargo surveys and complex Hull & Machinery cases contributed to a higher level of revenue. This increase reflects our desire to expand the business into new areas of Marine Consultancy. The business has a wide network of offices and the performance across the different locations varied with an improvement in the Middle East and Americas offset by lower level activity in the South East Asian region where trading conditions are challenging. We also increased our workforce with both traditional and new skillsets which underlines our commitment to growth, supporting our global client base and maintaining the technical standards of our staff.

Cory Brothers had a challenging year reflecting the tough Ship Agency and Logistics markets. Our strategy has been to focus on higher value work together with geographic expansion into European and US markets. We aim to provide clients with exceptional customer service while targeting regional and industryspecific growth opportunities.

Port Agency The Ship agency business services UK ports, the port of Singapore, and has expanded into North America serviced from a new office in Houston. The agency business also has joint arrangements with many worldwide agency partners most notably in Brazil, Amsterdam and Gibraltar. Our Global Hub business continues to grow through our blue chip customer base. The underlying UK port agency market has been difficult, but our market share has increased and ship numbers have been maintained. Markets continue to be challenging but there are signs of improvement in 2016. We are seeking to build our UK market share in the coming year as well as continuing to grow the Global Hub business and our presence in North America.

Forwarding and Logistics Cory Logistics revenue fell in 2015-16 due to delays to major infrastructure project cargoes and the impact of lower activity in the Oil and Gas markets. We were able to sustain our position in key business areas through growth in new services as well as the existing contract business. This was achieved despite a market backdrop of volatile freight rates. The introduction of new Logistics teams in Houston, Atlanta and Singapore have provided new opportunities of growth.

Overview Group revenue grew by 9.3% to г159.1 million, although the split of revenue across the three divisions has changed compared to last year. Revenue in Shipbroking has increased, primarily due to a full twelve months of results for the enlarged Shipbroking division. The Technical division reported higher revenue than last year, but revenue from Logistics decreased due to the lower level of revenue from freight forwarding.

Operating profit margin has improved significantly in the Shipbroking division due to the improved business efficiency and economies of scale. The margin in the Technical division has reduced due to a changing mix of business within the division. The operating profit margin of the Logistics division has also reduced partly due to costs associated with establishing the new offices in the US and partly due to extended project lead times.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Non-recurring and acquisitionrelated items Non-recurring costs largely relate to the completion of the integration of the Shipbroking businesses.
Intrinsically linked to the acquisition of ACM was a share plan that was put in place to retain key staff. The cost of this share plan is categorised as acquisition-related expenses and the charge in the year was г1.6 million (2014/15: г0.8 million). This charge will be approximately г1.6 million in 2016/17 and after that will reduce as the share awards start to vest. Finally, a charge of г1.1 million (2014/15: г1.8 million) has been incurred in relation to the amortisation of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of ACM as well as acquisitions from previous years.
Direct and operating costs Cost of sales comprises freight and haulage costs incurred in the Logistics division and payments to sub-contractors, materials, and other costs directly associated with the revenue to which they relate in other divisions. The level of cost of sales has reduced in the year in the forwarding and liner business within the Logistics division due to a lower level of activity, but this has been partly offset by a higher level of direct costs in the Technical businesses. The level of operating costs in the year is higher than last year and partially due to the full year impact of costs in the combined Shipbroking business compared to only seven months of costs in the previous year. The level of costs has also increased in the Technical division following successful recruitment and retention of staff in Braemar incorporating the Salvage Association and Braemar Engineering.
Central costs increased slightly during the year as a result of the increased size of the Group as well as non-recurring costs incurred in the first half associated with Group Board changes.
Finance costs The net finance cost for the year of г0.4 million (2015: г0.3 million cost) reflects the cost of working capital and the term facilities required to complete the ACM merger.
Balance sheet Net assets at 29 February 2016 were г107.3 million (2015: г104.3 million). The balance sheet is comparable to last year

and there have been no significant capital transactions during the year. Net working capital is also at a similar level to last year but against an increase in business volumes, demonstrating our drive to improve cash conversion.
Borrowings and cash At the balance sheet date, the Group has bank facilities of г15 million comprising a revolving facility of г10 million and an amortising term loan of г5 million that is repayable at г450,000 each quarter. At the end of the year the Group had net cash of г9.2 million (2015: г7.2 million) made up of г11.5 million of cash and г2.3 million of drawings of the facility.
The normal pattern of cash for the Group is for the second half of the year to show higher cash generation than the first half when the majority of staff bonuses are paid and the final dividend is paid to shareholders.
During April 2016, the Group entered a new banking relationship with HSBC. This provided total facilities of г30 million, made up of a revolving credit facility of г15 million and an accordion facility of г15 million. HSBC also provides access to global cash management opportunities, notably in our regional hubs of UK, Singapore and Australia.
Retirement benefits The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new members. The scheme has a net liability of г1.2 million (2015: г1.5 million) which is recorded on the balance sheet at 29 February 2016. The current level of scheme specific funding is a cash contribution of г0.45 million annually.
Foreign exchange The US dollar exchange rate relative to sterling moved by 10% in the year from US$1.55/г1 at the start of the year to US$1.39/г1 at the end of the year. A significant proportion of the Group's revenue is earned in US dollars and the movement of the exchange rate has had a positive impact on earnings. However, the Group has maintained its treasury policy during the year to mitigate the full impact of the movement in the US dollar and at the end of the year held US$31 million of forward cover at an average rate of US$1.477/г1.

Taxation The Group's effective tax rate in relation to continuing operations in 2015/16 was 23.9% (2015: 25.9%). The rate is higher than the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 20% largely due to the effect of disallowed expenses, the effect of tax deducted on repatriating cash from overseas and higher overseas corporate tax rates. The Group's profits are spread across a number of jurisdictions with both higher and lower corporate tax rates.

Earnings per share Underlying earnings per share have increased 7.5% to 34.70 pence and enables a dividend cover for the full year of 1.3 times.

Global greenhouse gas emissions data We are not a significant producer of greenhouse gas emissions. Two of our businesses hold ISO 14000 environmental accreditation.

In accordance with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Directors' Reports) Regulations 2013 we have made a calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions based on our consumption of greenhouse gas for the year ended 29 February 2016. The result of this calculation is compared with last year in the table below. The difference in overseas electricity measure is as a result of different guidelines on the conversion of Kwh to CO2e, rather than in the underlying Kwh.

Resources and relationships
A people business

Our people Throughout the Braemar Group the relationship with our employees underpins our operations. Having a workforce that is motivated, skilled, engaged and safe is key to our success and ensures that all of our staff are empowered to realise their potential.

The link between employees' performance and that of the Group is encouraged, where appropriate, through participation in an annual discretionary bonus linked to value delivery and share option schemes including deferred share awards and Save As You Earn Schemes.
The Group seeks to provide a fair and professional work-place for all of its employees and has invested significant sums establishing highquality combined offices across the globe. We are also

committed to ensuring high professional standards which are achieved partly through the application of Groupwide employment policies which cover equal opportunities, bullying, harassment and whistleblowing. The Group aims to provide equal opportunities for all employees so that they can work without discrimination on the grounds of race, religious or political beliefs, marital status, age, gender, sexual orientation or disability. We also aim to ensure that people from any background or gender have equal access to employment, training and career progression opportunities and we strive to select individuals on merit. The code of conduct that we operate under is summarised in seven core values:

People н Our people are the most important part of our business and the key to our success. Culture н We provide a culture that embodies excellence, inspires, motivates and provides the vehicle to excel at all levels. Clients н We are innovators, continually focused on quality, cost and providing services that meet our clients' needs. Integrity н We work with integrity and pride. We do the right thing at the right time. Risk н We understand risk and seek to manage it for the betterment of our Group and our clients Environment н We care about the environment and take steps to reduce our impact and that of our contractors Safety н We care about the safety of our people, of our contractors and of our clients.

As at 29 February 2016, there were six Directors of Braemar Shipping Services plc, five of which were male. Out of 978 staff in the Group, 26% are female. Senior management female representation is limited and includes one Executive Group and Operating Board member.

We look to identify current and/or future potential successors to senior management roles throughout the Group. This includes emphasis on gender diversity and is actively encouraged by the Group and divisional boards.

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

We recognise that staff in our Technical and Logistics divisions operate in higher risk environments and each of these divisions employs full time, health and safety professionals specialising in their respective areas of business. Both Braemar Howells and Cory Brothers in the UK have accreditation to ISO 18001 occupational health and safety management standard and Cory also has the ISO 14001 environmental standard.
Our disciplined approach ensures that risks to which staff and contractors are exposed are reduced to a minimum possible without:
нн causing harm to staff, clients and third parties;
нн damaging assets and thereby causing consequential business/ financial loss;
нн adversely affecting the environment; and
нн damaging the Group or its companies' reputations.
Client relationships Our clients rely on us to provide insight and access to the market-place and skilled expertise in applying knowledge and skills to their advantage. They require us to be absolutely trusted and professional in everything that we do. We provide a broader range of services than the majority of our competitors. This enables us to build a broad-based reputation for knowledge, skill and trustworthiness around the Braemar brand.
Our shipbrokers are focused on serving and developing their client base which is both diverse and international. It includes major ship owners, operators and yards as well as energy companies, miners, banks, traders and other financial institutions. The increase of major principals in the Far East and USA over recent years has shaped the development of our Shipbroking division and we have increased the number of staff based in the Far East and US offices.

The client base for technical services is similarly diverse and includes many overlapping sectors. Energy companies, insurers and P&I clubs are the largest clients in this sector. Our environmental business keeps in touch with those who may require their services in an emergency.
Our Logistics and Shipbroking client bases overlap especially in the tanker markets. In addition, we provide freight forwarding and project management services to major multinationals which require logistics solutions.
Our reputation and brand We have brought the acquired businesses under the Braemar brand, though we have retained the positive historic associations with the brands "Cory Brothers" and the "Salvage Association" both of which have more than 100 years of presence in their markets. We continue to cultivate the Braemar brand and its association with expertise, trust, reliability and ethical conduct across its wide range of service areas.
Developing and managing these positive brand attributes are key to our strategic objective of building our scale and standing out in a fragmented marketplace. In the current year our two Technical businesses located in the City of London were brought together into one office with a common "Braemar" office style.
Our knowledge management We are developing global, proprietary processes and procedures across our chosen markets to manage the information capture and flows which allows us to provide our clients with know-how, experience and proven techniques to match our advice to their requirements.
This is supported by comprehensive market information and bespoke analytical research and modelling and forecasting which enables us to provide a competitive advantage to our clients.

Our ethical footprint The Group is committed to undertaking business to the highest standards and has clear ethical guidelines on antibribery and corruption. These are issued to all Group companies and compliance is monitored on a regular basis. We provide ongoing training and support for staff on a rolling basis. Compliance with these ethical guidelines is monitored by the Audit Committee and through the Group's internal audit procedures.
We operate from offices across the globe and we support a number of charitable causes many of which are concerned with maritime causes. We continue to provide support for young people who wish to embark upon a career in the maritime industries through support for students at universities studying maritime courses.

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016
Principal risks and uncertainties

We have developed our approach to the assessment, management and reporting of risks with a process and governance structure which enables the Audit Committee to review the nature and extent of the identified risks that the Group faces. The risk monitoring process to monitor risk has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
Responsibility for the identification and management of risk (including monitoring and updating) is delegated to the business unit managing directors within the Shipbroking, Technical and Logistics divisions. In addition, we gather specific expertise on specialist areas such as insurance, IT, human resources and treasury which are all fed into the risk monitoring process. The Company takes measures to mitigate risk, including taking out insurance protection to an appropriate amount.

A Group budget is prepared annually and approved by the Board. The performances of the Group and the individual operating units are monitored against budget throughout the year and significant variances are investigated. Regular re-forecasts for the remainder of the financial year are prepared during the year.
The Group operates an internal system of checks and authorisations and independent audits are conducted in relation to the ISO 9001:2000 certification which Braemar ACM Shipbroking Limited, Cory Brothers Shipping Agency Limited, Braemar Howells Limited, Braemar Technical Services (Engineering) Ltd and Braemar Technical Services (Offshore) all hold.
The Group operates a whistleblowing procedure using an externally provided helpline through which any member of staff around the world may raise, in confidence, any concerns they may have about the way the Group is run or business is conducted.

The Board monitors treasury activity through regular reporting by the Finance Director. The Group does not enter into speculative treasury or derivative transactions.
By their nature, event-based risks will vary in likelihood and impact. "Heat maps" are used as a method to evaluate collectively the extent of all risks within a similar categorisation or certain profile and to illustrate the effectiveness of our mitigation of a single risk by capturing the gross and current (net of mitigation controls) position of each individual risk.
These are then aggregated and reviewed to assess their impact on Group business model and strategy and the resources required to ensure they are managed effectively. The divisional management boards and the Corporate Risk Team, which includes the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, monitor these risks regularly and considers its appetite and tolerance for them in the light of their potential impact on the Group.

Each of the principal risks are segregated into the following categories:
нн Staff and cost structure нн Financial нн IT and communications нн Commercial, worldwide and
external forces нн Professional conduct.
Principal risks are aggregated, together with associated issues or areas of uncertainty, the extent of control/ mitigation and potential for material effect on the market value of the Group is then assessed. By definition these unmitigated risks can be significant but the risk levels fall after taking account of our control processes and management actions.
The resulting principal risks and uncertainties are summarised below in the Risk Register table.

The colour coding defines the major risks into three broad bands of risk both before and after our mitigating actions.
Potential significant impact on market value of the Group
Potential material impact on market value of the Group
Potential minor impact on market value of the Group
Our major risks after mitigating actions are staff retention, currency exposure and market exposure. Our stated Group strategy is to manage our portfolio of business to manage the net risks to shareholders.

Internal audit The Group's internal audit function is explained in the Corporate Governance section on page 35 and follows a risk-based review process taking into account the results of the Group's annual risk assessment.
Going concern The Group has a strong balance sheet and continues to be cash generative. The Directors believe that it is well positioned to successfully manage its risks. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue to trade for the next twelve months and for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Viability Statement In accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code ("the Code"), the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over a period of three years, which they believe is an appropriate period based on the Group's current financial position, budgets and forecasts, strategy, principal risks and exposure to potentially volatile market forces. The Directors, in conjunction with the Group finance team, have completed a robust testing of this assessment and, taking account of this, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three financial years.

The Directors' testing of the assessment included a review of the financial impact of significant adverse scenarios, including severe downside cases resulting from significant declines in Group profitability that could threaten the viability of the Group together with the likely effectiveness of the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the Group over this period. Under these scenarios, the Group would be able to continue to operate within its banking facilities and covenants.
In assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.

Corporate Governance Statement

Chairman's introduction We are committed to achieving a high standard of corporate governance within the Group. We believe this is essential to sustain our reputation and the continuing trust and support of our shareholders, employees, clients and other stakeholders.
The Board endorses the principles and provisions set out in the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council. This statement, together with the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 50, describes how the Board and its sub-committees operate and how the Company has applied the Code during the year ended 29 February 2016.
David Moorhouse CBE, FNI Chairman 13 May 2016
Compliance The Board believes that the Company has been compliant with the Code throughout the year, with the exception of B.1.1 on non-executives serving for more than nine years. David Moorhouse CBE has served on the Board for eleven years and we believe that he remains wholly independent in character and judgement, with no relationships or circumstances that are otherwise likely to affect or appear to affect his judgement.
The UK Corporate Governance Code is publicly available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk.
Shareholder relations The Board recognises the importance of maintaining good communications with shareholders. The Group pursues an active investor relations programme conducted primarily through regular meetings of the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director with existing and potential investors following both the interim and preliminary announcements of the results of the Group. Feedback on shareholder meetings is provided via the Group's corporate stockbroker and public relations adviser. Corporate announcements are made available on the Group's website.
The Board exercises care to ensure that all information, especially that which is potentially price-sensitive, is released to all shareholders at the same time in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
The Company encourages attendance at its Annual General Meeting where each resolution is separately put to the meeting and where the Chief Executive makes a statement on the current year's performance to date and the near-term financial outlook.

Leadership
The Board The Board is responsible to shareholders for the effective direction and control of the Group and it aims to provide entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls, enabling risks to be assessed and managed.
The Board carried out a review of its composition during 2014/15 and, following the Annual General Meeting on 24 June 2015, David Moorhouse CBE succeeded Sir Graham Hearne as Chairman. At the same time Timothy Jaques, Denis Petropoulos and Johnny Plumbe retired from the Board and Martin Beer stepped down as Group Finance Director and was replaced by Louise Evans. The Board now comprises an independent non-executive Chairman, a Chief Executive, a Group Finance Director and three independent non-executive Directors. The Board believes the current composition is appropriate having regard to the Company's size and activities.
The non-executive Directors, none of whom has fulfilled an executive role within the Company, are appointed for an initial three-year term subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. David Moorhouse CBE chairs the Board and Nominations Committee; Alastair Farley is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and chairs the Audit Committee and J№rgen Breuer chairs the Remuneration Committee.
The Board met eight times during the year and the attendance by the Directors is set out below. Board meetings include reviews of financial and business performance and consideration and monitoring of business risks and opportunities. The following matters are specifically reserved for the Board's consideration and approval:
нн Group strategy; нн Group budget; нн major capital expenditure, disposals or leasing
arrangements; нн choice of key corporate advisers; нн acquisitions and disposals; нн Group financial and treasury policy including dividends
and borrowing; нн establishing Board committees and setting their terms of
reference; and нн internal control arrangements.
On an ongoing basis, the Board receives reports on business activities from the senior management of a division or a business manager.

Board committees The Board has three standing committees, Audit, Nominations and Remuneration. Each of the Board committees comprises solely non-executive Directors. The composition and responsibilities for the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are set out in each of the committee reports, on pages 36, 38 and 39, respectively. The Remuneration Committee Report on pages 39 to 50 is incorporated into this Statement by reference.

Effectiveness
During the year the Board engaged an independent specialist to carry out a review of the performance of the Board and its Committees against the framework of Board effectiveness produced by the FRC. Directors and the Company Secretary were interviewed and Board and Committee papers were reviewed. The anonymity of all respondents was ensured throughout the process and the results were discussed with the Chairman and then presented to the Board. The review concluded that the Board and its committees are effective and demonstrate an appropriate level of governance relative to the size of Braemar Shipping Services plc.
Under the Company's Articles of Association, the Directors should submit themselves for re-election every three years. In accordance with the Code, all Directors will retire at this year's AGM and seek re-election annually by shareholders.

Accountability
The Board is responsible for assessing the Company's position and prospects and for ensuring that the information presented to shareholders is fair, balanced and understandable. Further details of the Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Company's financial statements are set out in the statement of Directors' responsibilities on page 52.
The Board is also responsible for determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives, for maintaining the Company's system of internal controls and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness of these systems annually. The Audit Committee is responsible for the independent review and challenge of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management approach and for reporting its findings to the Board.
Risk management and internal control The Board acknowledges the requirements of the Code and seeks to review aspects of risk management in relation to each part of the Group. The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the implementation and effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls in accordance with the Turnbull guidance. These are designed to identify and manage the particular risks to which the Group is exposed. By their very nature these controls can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during the year and proposes actions to strengthen the controls, which the Board implements as necessary. The Group also holds professional indemnity insurance to an amount considered adequate for its size and potential exposure.
The Group's internal control processes encompass the controls over the preparation of financial information, including consolidated financial statements.
A summary of key risks and internal controls is prepared for consideration at the Audit Committee on an annual basis and these are then presented to the Board. The major risks are detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 31.
Ethical conduct and anti-bribery measures The Group is committed to undertaking business to the highest standards and has clear ethical guidelines which are issued to all Group companies in both English and local languages where appropriate. The Audit Committee monitors compliance with these ethical guidelines through internal procedures, particularly the internal audit function, and reports to the Board. There is a total prohibition on the payments of any kind of bribe and this is monitored through internal auditing. A programme of internal training is in place to ensure that Group staff are aware of these policies and understand how they relate to Group business. On an annual basis the head of each business unit is required to sign-off that the business for which they are responsible has complied with the Group's procedures.
Internal audit The Group's internal audit function is a riskbased review process, whereby senior financial managers from within the business conduct an audit of one of the Group's activities for which they have no managerial responsibility. The programme is coordinated by the Group Treasurer who presents the Group internal audit plan and reports to the Audit Committee. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the internal audit programme is met and recommendations are actioned. The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control throughout the year.

Non-executive Directors: Alastair Farley (Chairman), Mark Tracey, J№rgen Breuer (appointed 24 June 2015), David Moorhouse CBE (retired 24 June 2015).
Terms of reference The Committee's terms of reference can be found on our website www.braemar.com. They have been reviewed during the year to reflect changes in corporate governance best practice.

Key function and responsibilities Our key function, as the Audit Committee, is to address the following specific responsibilities, while adapting our activities as appropriate to address changing priorities within these objectives:
нн Financial reporting: reviewing the half-year and annual financial statements and advising the Board whether the accounts represent a fair, balanced and understandable view of the business; monitoring compliance with relevant statutory and listing requirements and the UK Bribery Act; and advising on the suitability of accounting policies, for example revenue recognition, use of estimates and critical judgements.
нн Internal control and risk management: reviewing internal control procedures and ensuring a robust risk assessment process; advising the Board on the significant risks facing the Group and monitoring the scope and effectiveness of the activities of the Group's internal audit activities.
нн Relationship with the external auditor: planning with the external auditors the half-year review and full-year audit programme including agreement as to the nature and scope of their audit as well as the level of the audit fee set in the context of the overall audit plan; and monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of the external auditor.
Our meetings are attended, by invitation, by the Chairman of the Board, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Head of Finance, the Group Treasurer and representatives of the external auditors. In addition to the formal Committee meetings, as Chairman of the Audit Committee I meet separately with the Group external audit partner and his team at least twice a year.
Review processes As a Committee we are specifically concerned with the following areas:
нн Risk management and internal control
нн Ethical conduct and anti-bribery measures
нн Internal audit
нн External audit

Significant issues During the year ended 29 February 2016, the significant issues which we have considered are as follows:

Other areas In addition, the other areas we have given focus to during the year were:

Annual Report We have reviewed the presentation of the Group's results for the year in this Annual Report. As part of our review, we have considered reports from the Group Finance Director and Group Head of Finance and the report presented by the external auditor summarising the findings of their annual audit and interim review.
The primary areas of judgement that we considered for the year ending 29 February 2016 were:
нн the assumptions underlying the testing for impairment of the Group's goodwill and intangible assets. The Committee reviewed the results of the Group's annual review for impairment which included the goodwill arising from the acquisition of ACM Shipping Group plc and which showed that there is no impairment and after considering reasonable stress testing concluded that significant headroom existed;
нн the basis of revenue recognition policy where the Group's entitlement to revenue is dependent on completion of third parties' obligations. The Committee considered the approach taken and policy applied and concluded that there were no material variances at 29 February 2016; and
нн the level of provision for the impairment of trade receivable balances. We believe that the Group's policy of providing for trade receivables over twelve months old, unless there is good reason not to, is currently appropriate. Good reason can include making a provision for amounts less than twelve months old if there is a risk of non-recovery, but also not making a provision for amounts over twelve months old if there is compelling evidence not to do so. The policy was reviewed and the Committee discussed and challenged the composition of the provision with executive management. There are no material variances to the policy at 29 February 2016.

нн increasing the scope of the Group's internal audit programme and changing the focus so that every location in the Group is visited at least every three years and the reviews planned each year take a risk based approach based on the annual risk assessment process;
нн a review of the Group's IT strategy and approach to cyber security including risk of data loss, backup and service reinstatement procedures, standardised infrastructure environments and remote staff working protocols;
нн a review of Group-wide insurance coverage taking account of the variety of professional services provided by the three divisions;
нн consideration of the requirements to assess and report on Group viability in accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code;
нн a review of the Group's anti-bribery and corruption procedures as well as the Group's approach to complying with international sanctions. The ongoing training programme that is provided to staff across the Group on all relevant legislation and compliance is an ongoing process and we continue to develop this education plan. This plan is supported by our intranet-based Braemar Management Framework which underpins this as well as other core Group controls;
нн agreeing the audit scope and related audit fee for the year with the external auditors. We put the audit out for tender in 2010 and this resulted in a change of audit firm and the appointment of KPMG LLP. We will have to put the audit out for tender by 2020 and are considering the exact timing of this with regard to the rotation of audit partner in 2017 and the cessation of a three-year fee agreement this year;
нн reviewing the level of audit fees in comparison to the total fees paid to the auditors for non-audit work. This year the audit fee represents 85% of the total fees and we consider the current level of audit fees acceptable. The proportion of non-audit fees last year was distorted by work related to the Group's Class 1 acquisition of ACM. KPMG LLP confirmed they consider themselves independent;
нн ongoing review of the Group Treasury Policy and the management of the Group debt facilities; and
нн consideration of the risks associated with the widespread and large number of small entities and locations that exist in the Group and the lower level of controls that naturally exist due to fewer number of employees. Our internal audit programme and Braemar Management Framework referred to above seek to address this and provide an underlying structure to build controls and processes.

Non-executive Directors: David Moorhouse CBE (Chairman), Alastair Farley, Mark Tracey, J№rgen Breuer (appointed 24 June 2015), Sir Graham Hearne CBE (retired 24 June 2015) and Timothy Jaques (retired 24 June 2015).
Terms of reference The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee, explaining its role and authority delegated by the Board, are available on www.braemar.com.

The main role of the Nominations Committee is to consider the composition of the Board and to plan and carry out appropriate succession as deemed necessary. We also review the re-appointment of non-executive Directors at the expiration of their letter of engagement. During the year David Moorhouse CBE succeeded Sir Graham Hearne CBE as Chairman of the Nominations Committee.
Succession planning Our succession planning has two key responsibilities, firstly to ensure that the Group is managed by executives with the necessary skills, experience and knowledge, and secondly to ensure that the Board has the right balance of individuals to be able to discharge its responsibilities effectively. As part of the annual evaluation of Board performance, all Directors are consulted on the composition of the Board, as to size, the appropriate range of skills and balance between executive and non-executive Directors.
During the year, the Committee discussed the Group's succession plan which considers the senior roles within the Group and identifies whether there is appropriate cover in place in the event that an individual leaves the organisation, and whether there is a permanent replacement available within the organisation, or whether the position will need to be filled externally.
Following the successful completion of the integration of Braemar and ACM, the Committee assessed the composition of the Board and reduced the number of members from ten to six. The current Board comprises a Chairman, a senior independent non-executive director, two independent non-executive directors, a chief executive and a finance director. The Committee believes this to be an appropriate structure for the future of the Group.
Diversity The Committee currently takes into account a variety of factors before recommending any new appointments to the Board, including relevant skills to perform the role, experience, knowledge, ethnicity and gender.
Braemar endeavours to achieve appropriate diversity, including gender diversity, throughout the Company and concurs with the recommendations of Lord Davies' review. The Committee will continue to ensure that members of the Board should collectively possess the broad range of skills, expertise and industry knowledge, and business and other experience necessary for the effective oversight of the Group.
Our policy, and duty, is to ensure that the best candidate is selected to join the Board and this approach will remain in place going forward, without prescriptive, quantitative targets.

Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
J№rgen Breuer Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Our remuneration philosophy The Committee's approach to executive remuneration remains unchanged. Our framework should be:
нн Market competitive. The structures and quantum of our remuneration arrangements must be sufficient to allow us to compete in the highly competitive global talent markets. At the same time, we should seek to pay no more than is necessary.
нн Simple and transparent. Our executive remuneration structures should be clear, understandable and motivating for participants and shareholders.
нн Aligned to performance. A substantial portion of executive reward should be aligned to profitability and long-term value delivered for shareholders. In line with our competitors, we operate profit sharing arrangements in the broking business.
нн Aligned to shareholders. We align long-term reward with the long-term value of our shares through share ownership guidelines and share-based remuneration.

on 24 June 2015.

Non-executive Directors: J№rgen Breuer (Chairman), Alastair Farley and Mark Tracey.

Competing for talent The success of our business is driven primarily by the talent of our employees and management team, and the relationships which they develop with our clients. It is therefore critical that we have the right remuneration framework to attract, retain and engage the calibre of talent that we need to drive performance for our shareholders.
As a UK listed company, we also aim to adhere to key principles of best practice on corporate governance and executive remuneration. As a result, the remuneration framework for our executive Directors (codified in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM) is aligned to key best practice principles in the UK.
At the same time, we compete for talent in a highly competitive global market which, in some areas, dictates particular remuneration structures and practices which we need to adopt to compete for such talent. For example, in the shipbroking industry, it is established custom and practice for a substantial proportion of overall remuneration to be driven directly from profit sharing arrangements, on an uncapped basis, with a relatively low level of fixed remuneration. The Committee considers the flexibility in our Remuneration Policy to apply such arrangements where appropriate is critical for our ability to compete for talent and is fully in the best interests of our shareholders.

Directors' Remuneration Report

Incentive outcomes for 2015/16 нн James Kidwell and Louise Evans participated in the annual
performance-related bonus arrangements, with a maximum annual bonus opportunity of 100% of their basic salary (for Louise Evans and Denis Petropoulos this was pro-rata to their period of Board service for 2015/16). For 2015/16 the Committee decided that the performance metric should be attributable to earnings per share. The Committee set the earnings per share hurdle for the EPS element of the executive Directors' annual bonus at 26 pence, with the maximum award for the EPS element being triggered at 40 pence. The reported earnings per share from continuing operations of 34.70 pence adjusted to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets have been used for the performance assessment producing an excess over the threshold hurdle of 8.7 pence. This resulted in annual bonus outturns of 62% of the maximum. Two-thirds was paid in cash and one-third is payable in deferred shares vesting in three years' time.
нн Based on performance over the three years ending 28 February 2015, the LTIP awards made to James Kidwell and Martin Beer in October 2012 did not meet the minimum performance condition over the three-year vesting period and lapsed on 30 October 2015.
нн No LTIP awards vested this year.

Structure of the report The report has been prepared in two sections:
1)The Remuneration Policy (pages 41 to 44). This includes, for information purposes, details of the remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM; and
2)The Annual Report on Remuneration (pages 45 to 50) which sets out the details of how our remuneration policy was implemented during 2015/16 and how it will be implemented in 2016/17. This will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at our 2016 AGM.
J№rgen Breuer Chairman, Remuneration Committee 13 May 2016

Approach to 2016/17 нн Following a review of the executive Directors' fixed
remuneration the Committee believes it appropriate to increase the base salary for Louise Evans to reflect her experience and performance compared to the relevant market rate.
нн The Committee introduced a cash pension supplement of г52,000 for James Kidwell in lieu of the Company making a contribution to his pension.
нн The fees of the non-executive Directors will be increased to reflect the increase in the size and complexity of the Company. The last increase was in 2013.
нн LTIP awards equivalent to 100% of basic salary will be granted to James Kidwell and Louise Evans. These awards will be based on EPS growth over a three-year period, requiring stretching performance of 13% per annum for maximum vesting.

Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP")

Purpose and link to strategy Operation

Maximum opportunity

Performance measures

To provide a variable element which aligns the reward of all executive Directors with long-term performance delivered for shareholders.

Awards are made under the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Awards vest subject to performance measured over a period of at least three years.
All executive Directors are eligible to participate each year at the discretion of the Committee.
Awards of shares are made at the discretion of the Committee and can be made in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares, or, where appropriate, the cash equivalent.
Any shares that vest may benefit from the value of dividends which would have been paid (if any) during the period between award and exercise.
Awards under the 2014 LTIP will be subject to a malus provision, as described in more detail on page 44.
The Plan rules provide for adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, awards may be adjusted in the event of variation of the Company's share capital, demerger, special dividend or similar event.

The usual maximum award opportunity in respect of a financial year is 100% of base salary.
However, in circumstances that the Committee considers to be exceptional, awards of up to 200% of base salary may be made.

Vesting is based on the achievement of performance targets set in respect of key financial performance measures (currently earnings per share for current executive Directors).
Where relevant to an executive Director, vesting may be based, in whole or in part, on measures specific to the performance of a subsidiary company or section of the Group.
25% vests for threshold performance.

Bonus deferral A portion of the Annual Bonus and Brokers' Bonus awards will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan ("DBP"). Such awards will vest, unless the Committee determines otherwise, after three years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment with the Group (with provisions for individuals who leave the Group set out in the table on page 42).
Any shares that vest may benefit from the value of dividends which would have been paid (if any) during the period between award and vesting.
The Committee may determine that DBP awards are made in conjunction with the Braemar Company Share Option Plan ("CSOP") to enable UK tax resident individuals to benefit from the growth in value of the shares subject to the awards in a tax-efficient manner. In such circumstances, when DBP awards are granted, a corresponding market value option will be granted under the terms of the CSOP, the maximum face value of which will be г30,000. The options will vest on the same terms as and on the same date as the corresponding DBP awards and must be exercised within two days following the vesting date. Under the terms of the CSOP, no income tax or employees' or employer's National Insurance contributions will be payable, on exercise, on the growth in value of the shares. The number of shares in respect of which the DBP awards will vest will be reduced to take account of the value, as at vesting, of the corresponding CSOP options. In addition, the number of CSOP options which will vest will be reduced in the event that the value, as at vesting, of the option exceeds the value, as at vesting, of the corresponding DBP award. CSOP awards would only be made in conjunction with the DBP as described above, and not on a stand-alone basis.
Malus provisions Awards under the DBP and the 2014 LTIP are subject to a malus provision which allows the Committee to reduce the number of shares subject to unvested awards and/or impose further conditions on unvested awards in certain circumstances which include:
нн a material re-statement of any financial results of the Company;
нн a material failure of risk management by the Company or a relevant business unit; or
нн serious reputational damage to the Company or a relevant business unit as a result of the participant's misconduct or failure of supervision.

Clawback нн The Annual Bonus is subject to a clawback provision such
that (i) in circumstances of a material re-statement of any financial results of the Company which takes place within three years of the payment of an amount under the plans, or (ii) the discovery of facts, within three years of the payment of an amount under the plans, which would have entitled the Company to have summarily dismissed the recipient without notice, the Committee has discretion to require the repayment of some or all of the amount received. In 2015/16 the Committee introduced a right to clawback vested LTIP awards in circumstances where there is a material re-statement of the financial results within two years or discovery of facts which could have entitled the Company to have summarily dismissed the Director without notice.

Service contracts and letters of appointment The current executive Directors have rolling service contracts that provide for a notice period by either party. The notice period ranges between 6-12 months. The Company may terminate the executive Director's contract by making a payment in lieu of notice of the unexpired notice period equivalent to a value comprising of salary, pension and contractual benefits. There is no provision in any of the service contracts of the executive Directors for any ex-gratia payments.

It is intended that the policy above would be applied to the service contracts for future executive Director appointments. In addition, future service contracts would normally include a provision that payments in lieu of notice may be made on a phased basis subject to mitigation.

The Chairman and non-executive Directors are appointed pursuant to a letter of appointment. The policy is that nonexecutive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years which may be extended for further three-year periods on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee and with the Board's agreement subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The non-executive Directors' letters of appointment are to be terminable on one month's notice from either party.

Annual bonus for 2015/16 (audited) James Kidwell and Louise Evans participated in the annual performance-related bonus arrangements, with a maximum annual bonus opportunity of 100% of their basic salary (for Louise Evans this was pro-rata to her period of service for 2015/16). For 2015/16 the Committee decided that the performance metric should be attributable to earnings per share. The Committee set the earnings per share hurdle for the EPS element of the executive Directors' annual bonus at 26 pence, with the maximum award for the EPS element being triggered at 40 pence. The reported earnings per share from continuing operations of 34.70 pence adjusted to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets have been used for the performance assessment producing an excess over the threshold hurdle of 8.7 pence. This resulted in annual bonus outturns of 62% of the maximum. Two-thirds was paid in cash and one-third is payable in deferred shares vesting in three years' time. This amount is shown in the "single total figure of remuneration" table above.

2012 LTIP award н vesting in respect of 2014/15 (audited) The 2012 LTIP awards were granted in October 2012 and were based on performance over the three-year performance period ending in 2015/16 against the EPS targets set when the award was granted, summarised in the table below. Based on the annual results to February 2015 the Committee determined that the 2012 LTIP awards made to James Kidwell and Martin Beer did not meet the minimum performance condition over the three-year vesting period and therefore lapsed on 30 October 2015.

Shareholding guidelines and share interests (audited) Under the shareholding guidelines, executive Directors are required to build and retain a shareholding in the Group at least equivalent to 100% of base salary. This guideline is expected to be met within five years of appointment to the Board.

Non-executive Directors are not subject to a shareholding guideline.

The following table sets out the shareholding (including connected persons) of the Directors in the Company as at 29 February 2016. This shows that James Kidwell has met the shareholding guideline. Louise Evans has yet to meet the guideline but was appointed in June 2015 and is therefore within the five-year time scale to meet the guideline.

Directors' Remuneration Report
continued

Consideration of Directors' remuneration н Remuneration Committee and advisers The Remuneration Committee is comprised solely of non-executive Directors and comprises J№rgen Breuer as Chairman, Alastair Farley and Mark Tracey.
The Committee has agreed Terms of Reference which set out its authority and responsibilities, which include:
нн to determine on behalf of the Board and shareholders the Group's overall policy for executive remuneration; нн to determine individual remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors of the Company, including their base salary
and all performance-related elements including bonus arrangements, profit share schemes, equity participation schemes, other long-term incentive schemes, pension and other benefits; нн to review the introduction and to determine the terms of all bonus, profit share or equity participation schemes or any other schemes intended to reward and incentivise employees of the Group and to review the participation of the executive Directors and senior executives in such schemes, including the award of any bonuses and the grant of rights or options thereunder; and нн to maintain an overview of policy in relation to the remuneration and conditions of service of other senior executives within the Group.

In discharging these responsibilities the Committee may call for information and advice from advisers inside and outside the Group. During 2015/16, the Committee took advice from the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director who attended by the invitation of the Committee but did not participate in any discussions regarding or affecting their own remuneration.

The Committee has sought advice from Deloitte LLP during 2015/16 in respect of the review of Executive and Non-Executive Directors fixed remuneration and fees. Fees of г5,000 were charged by Deloitte LLP for the provision of independent advice to the Committee. Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, that provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Braemar Shipping Services plc that may impair their objectivity and independence. Deloitte LLP provided no other services to the Group during the financial year.

The total number of options to subscribe for shares that were outstanding as at 13 May 2016 was 415,457, being 1.4% of the issued share capital. If the authority to purchase shares is used in full, the proportion of issued share capital represented by this number of options would amount to 1.3%.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 32 and 33 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Braemar Shipping Services plc for the year ended 29 February 2016 set out on pages 56 to 93. In our opinion:
нн the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 29 February 2016 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;
нн the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
нн the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
нн the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:

(a) Recognition of Shipbroking revenue н г70,699,000 (2015: г53,589,000)

The risk

Our response

Refer to page 37 of the Audit Committee Report, note 1(c) and 1(d) of the accounting policies and note 2 to the financial statements.
The Group's Shipbroking division recognises commission revenue at a date which is dependent upon the completion of two or more independent third parties. Braemar has little control over when and if these parties fulfil their contractual obligations. Judgement is therefore required as to whether and when the third parties' obligations have been fulfilled in order for commission revenue to be recognised in the appropriate period and therefore whether inclusion of revenue in the appropriate period has been appropriately applied.

Our audit procedures included:
нн testing a sample of Shipbroking transactions by agreeing the details of these transactions to the underlying contract and other supporting documentation for evidence of when both the third parties and the Group fulfilled their performance obligations;
нн agreeing that the revenue for the sample of transactions was appropriately recognised in the correct period in accordance with both the underlying documentation and the Group's accounting policies for each type of Shipbroking transaction; and
нн considering the risk that counter parties have not completed their obligations by challenging the Directors' assumptions or when or if to recognise revenue, taking account of their and our knowledge of industry developments.

(b) Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income н г50,916,000 (2015: г49,508,000)

The risk

Our response

Refer to page 37 of the Audit Committee Report, note 1(c) and 1(k) of the accounting policies and note 18 to the financial statements.
A significant portion of the Group's trade receivables and accrued income are with customers that operate in the shipping, marine and offshore industries. The global shipping, marine and offshore industries continue to be affected by certain economic factors, such as low demand and oversupply of the global fleet. Many companies are experiencing continued financial stress. The Group has experience of both significant delays between issuing an invoice and receiving payment and non-payment of debts. Determining whether a trade receivable or accrued income balance is collectible involves a certain level of management judgement, including historical payment patterns and other information related to the current creditworthiness of the counterparty.

Our audit procedures included:
нн testing a sample of trade receivable and accrued income balances that have been provided against to determine the accuracy of judgements made by the Group. This testing included considering the age of the receivables or accrued income, customer payment history, and post year-end payments received by the Group;
нн analysing older receivable and accrued income balances that have not been provided for to determine whether there were any indicators of non-collectability which would require these receivables or accrued income to be provided against;
нн analysing changes in the prior year bad debt provision, in particular understanding how much of the provisions were utilised and how much was released in order to assess the appropriateness of the Group's debt provisioning policy;
нн testing the accuracy of the data extracted from the Group's accounting systems which is used in calculating the ageing of trade receivables and accrued income; and
нн we have also considered the adequacy of the Group's disclosures about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the provision.

In the prior year our assessment of risks of material misstatement also included acquisition accounting as during the year the Group acquired ACM Shipping Group plc.

3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at г1.25 million (2015: г1.25 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group total revenue of г159.1 million (2015: г145.8 million), of which it represents less than 1% (2015: less than 1%). We consider revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure than profit before tax and it is the Directors' and external shareholders' principal metric of performance.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results:
Total revenue
Audit 60% (2015: 64%)
Specified audit procedures 27% (2015: 20%)

We report to the Audit Committee:
(i) all material corrected identified misstatements; (ii) uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding г62,500
(2015: г62,500); and (iii) o ther identified misstatements that warrant reporting on
qualitative grounds.
Of the Group's 64 reporting components (2015: 64 reporting components), we subjected 19 (2015: 20) to audits for Group reporting purposes and 11 (2015: 8) to specified risk-focused audit procedures over revenue, trade receivables, cash and payroll expense. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.

Profit before tax

Desktop procedures 13% (2015: 16%)
Audit 69% (2015: 62%) Specified audit procedures 14% (2015: 25%) Desktop procedures 17% (2015: 13%)

Total assets

Audit 78% (2015: 52%)
Specified audit procedures 12% (2015: 22%)
Desktop procedures 10% (2015: 26%)

The remaining 13% (2015: 16%) of total Group revenue, 17% (2015: 13%) of Group profit before tax and 10% (2015: 26%) of total Group assets is represented by 34 reporting components (2015: 36 reporting components), none of which individually represented more than 2% of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these components and conducted desktop procedures of these components.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the materiality level of the components, which ranged from г500 to г1,000,000 (2015: г500 to г1,000,000), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on six of the 30 in-scope components (2015: six of the 28 components) was prepared by component auditors and the rest by the Group team.

The Group audit team visited three components in the United States (2015: seven components in Singapore). Additionally, the Group team held several telephone conference meetings with both these and other component auditors in Singapore and Australia. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified In our opinion:
нн the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
нн the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
нн the Directors' Viability Statement on page 31, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors' assessment and expectations of the Group's continuing in operation over the three years to 28 February 2019; or
нн the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other information in the Annual Report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
нн adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
нн the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
нн certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
нн we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
нн the Directors' statements, set out on page 31, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and
нн the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 34 relating to the Company's compliance with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 52, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the Company's members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/ auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

нн we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors' statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy; or
нн the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

General information Group and Company financial statements of Braemar Shipping Services plc for the year ended 29 February 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 13 May 2016. Braemar Shipping Services plc is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England and Wales.
The term "Company" refers to Braemar Shipping Services plc and "Group" refers to the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and of the employee share ownership plan trust.
1 Accounting policies a) Basis of preparation and forward-looking statements The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. No income statement is presented for Braemar Shipping Services plc as provided by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue to trade for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention except for the derivative financial instruments and investments, which are measured at fair value.
Certain statements in this Annual Report are forward-looking. Although the Group believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (г'000) except where otherwise indicated.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group The annual improvements (2011-2013) to existing standards which are mandatory for the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 March 2015 have had no material impact on the Group.
There were no other new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that had to be implemented during the year that significantly affect these financial statements.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the financial year beginning 1 March 2015 and not early adopted As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU). The Group has not applied these standards and interpretations in the preparation of these financial statements:
нн Amendment to IAS 19 regarding defined benefit plans нн Amendment to IFRS 11, "Joint arrangements" on acquisition
of an interest in a joint operation

нн Amendment to IAS 16, "Property, plant and equipment" and IAS 38, "Intangible assets", on depreciation and amortisation
нн Amendments to IFRS 10, "Consolidated financial statements" and IAS 28, "Investments in associates and joint ventures"
нн IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers" нн IFRS 9 "Financial instruments" нн Amendments to IFRS 9, "Financial instruments", regarding
general hedge accounting нн Amendment to IAS 1, "Presentation of financial statements"
on the disclosure initiative.
The impact on the Group's financial statements of the future adoption of these and other new standards and interpretations is still under review, but the Group does not expect any of these changes to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group. There were no other new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Group and the Company made up to 28 February each year or 29 February in a leap year.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated using the purchase method of accounting, from the date on which control of the net assets and operation of the acquired company are effectively transferred to the Group. Similarly, the results of subsidiaries divested cease to be consolidated from the date on which control of the net assets and operations are transferred out of the Group.
Investments in joint ventures and associates and where the Group has significant influence are equity accounted and carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group's share of the post-tax result of the joint venture or associate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Use of estimates and critical judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as endorsed by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
A key judgement, not involving estimation, which the Group makes applies to its approach to revenue recognition particularly in respect of the assessments made regarding the appropriate timing of recognition of revenue. This can involve assessment of completion of third parties' obligations in order for commission or similar revenue to be recognised.
The Group excludes exceptional and acquisition-related items from its "underlying" earnings measures. The Directors believe that, if properly used, such additional performance measures can provide users of the financial statements with a better understanding of the Group's financial performance and strategy. If improperly used and presented, such measures could mislead users of the financial statements by obscuring the real profitability and financial position of the Group.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued

1 Accounting policies continued The key areas where the Group makes judgements involving estimates are in the following areas:
нн Acquisition accounting: Following the acquisition of a business, the Group carries out a review to assess the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. This will include applying a level of judgement to understand any premium paid for a business represents as well as then carrying out a detailed calculation of fair values;
нн Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. However, the Group will also test for impairment at other times if there is an indication that an impairment may exist. Before carrying out a detailed review, the Directors will first make a judgement as to whether the impact is significant enough to perform a detailed calculation, taking into account their knowledge of the specific business unit and their experience of the market. Some of the critical assumptions applied when carrying out an impairment review are set out in Note 13;
нн Provision for impairment of trade receivables: Ongoing judgements are required in assessing the appropriate level of impairment provision taking into account the age of the receivables and risk of the amounts not being recovered (see Note 18).
d) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue of the Group consists of:
i)Shipbroking н income comprises commission arising from tanker and dry cargo charter broking, sale and purchase broking, offshore broking and consultancy and valuation fees. The Group acts as a broker for several types of shipping transactions, each of which gives rise to an entitlement to commission.
For single voyage chartering, the contractual terms are governed by a standard charter party contract in which the broker's commission is earned and recognised when the cargo has been loaded or discharged according to the contractual terms;
For time charters the commission is specified in the hire agreement and is earned and recognised over the term of the charter simultaneously with the hire payments being made;
In the case of second-hand sale and purchase contracts, the broker's commission is earned and recognised when the principals in the transaction complete on the sale/purchase and the title of the vessel passes from the seller to the buyer;
With regard to newbuilding contracts, the commission is recognised when contractual stage payments are made by the purchaser of a vessel to a shipyard which in turn reflects the performance of services over the contract;
For income derived from providing ship and fleet valuations, the Group recognises income when a valuation certificate is provided to the client and the service is invoiced.

ii)Technical н fee income comprises fees for the supply of technical, energy loss adjusting and environmental services. Income from technical services is recognised on a time incurred and recoverable expenses basis net of provisions.
iii)Logistics н agency income is recognised at the point when the ship sails from the port. Forwarding and logistics income is recognised when the ship departs. Where the Group acts as a principal rather than as agent, the revenue and costs are shown gross.
Other income of the Company consists of dividends from investments. Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' legal rights to receive payment have been established.
e) Foreign currencies The presentational currency of the Group is pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are recognised in the income statement.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments contracts, mainly forward contracts and other derivative currency contracts (see Note 1(l)).
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, branches and associates are translated from their functional currency into pounds sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Trading results are translated at the average rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the consolidation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries are dealt with through the foreign currency translation reserve (see Note 27), whilst those arising from trading transactions are dealt with in the income statement. On disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
f) Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group and Company's liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. Deferred taxation is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to taxable transactions taken directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity. The deferred tax is released to the income statement at the same time as the taxable transaction is recognised in the income statement. Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

g) Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in operating costs in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill on acquisitions arising prior to 1 March 2004 has been retained at prior amounts and will be tested annually for impairment.
In relation to acquisitions where the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the excess fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset, on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows (except for long and short leasehold interests which are written off against the remaining period of the lease):

Motor vehicles Computers Fixtures and equipment

н three years н four years н four years

j) Investments Investments in associates and joint ventures where the Group has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the financial statements.

Investments where the Group has no significant influence are held at fair value with movements in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income other than impairments which are recorded in the Income Statement.

Investments in the Company are shown at cost less impairment.

h) Intangible assets i) Computer software T he Group capitalises computer software at cost. It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of up to four years. The carrying value of intangible assets with a finite life is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
ii) Research and development T he Group capitalises internally-generated development costs when it is able to demonstrate:
нн the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it is subsequently available for use;
нн that there is a clear intention that the intangible asset would be completed and then used;
нн that it is able to use the intangible asset; нн that future economic benefits are probable; нн that there are adequate technical, financial and other
resources to complete the development and to use the asset; and нн the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured
The Group amortises research and development over a straightline basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
iii) Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward order book and customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life of two to ten years.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
i) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment value.

k) Impairment The carrying amount of the Group's assets other than financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, are reviewed each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations, which requires the use of estimates. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its recoverable amount.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the assets with the exception of goodwill is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount. This cannot exceed the carrying amount prior to the impairment charge. An impairment recognised in the income statement in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date. Recognition of the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if it is, the nature of the item being hedged. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group designates derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge where there is a high probability of the forecast transactions arising. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement at the same time as the gains or losses on the hedged items. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) at the balance sheet date.

1 Accounting policies continued m) Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original value and recoverable amount. Provision is made where there is evidence that the balances will not be recovered in full.
n) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents included in the balance sheet comprise cash in hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and restricted cash.
Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement include cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
o) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or otherwise) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If material, the provisions are discounted using an appropriate current pre-tax interest rate.
p) Share-based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share-based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share-based remuneration is equity settled. The balance sheet entry is included in reserves. Shares issued in respect of the deferred bonus plan are valued at the market value on the date the shares are purchased.
The Company reflects the fair value of the share-based payments as an investment in its subsidiaries.
q) Commissions payable Commissions payable to clients are recognised in trade payables due within one year on the earlier of the date of invoicing or the date of receipt of cash.
r) Pension scheme arrangements The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
i) Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. Pension costs charged against profits in respect of these schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group within independently administered funds. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

on scheme assets which are shown as a net finance cost and past service costs are presented and recognised immediately in the income statement.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of this scheme represents the difference between the present value of the Group's obligations under the scheme and the fair value of the scheme's assets. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income.
s) Borrowings Arrangement costs for bonds and loan facilities in respect of debt are capitalised and amortised over the life of the debt at a constant rate.
Finance costs are charged to the income statement, based on the effective interest rate of the associated borrowings.
t) Leasing Operating leases are charged to the income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
u) Segmental analysis The Group's segmental analysis is based on its three business segments: Shipbroking, Technical and Logistics. This is consistent with the way the Group manages itself and with the format of the Group's internal financial reporting.
The second analysis is presented according to the geographic markets comprising the UK, Singapore, Other Asia, Australia and the Rest of the World. The Group's geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group's assets and operations.
v) Exceptional and acquisition-related items Exceptional items are significant items of a non-recurring nature and considered material in both size and nature. These are disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance.
Acquisition-related items are significant items directly associated with a business combination and considered material in both size and nature. These are disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance.
w) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a noncurrent asset (a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.

ii) Defined benefit schemes The Group acquired a defined benefit scheme as part of the acquisition of ACM Shipping Group plc with assets held separately from the Group. The cost of providing benefits under the scheme is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method which measures the liability based on service completed and allowing for projected future salary increases and discounted at an AA corporate bond rate.
The current service cost, which is the increase in the present value of the retirement benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, are included within operating profit in the consolidated income statement. The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities, the expected return

On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is restated as if the operation has been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

2 Segmental information a) Business segments Management has determined the operating segments for the Group based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to make strategic decisions. The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors.
The Board consider the business from both a service line and geographical perspective. A description of each of the lines of service is provided in Braemar at a glance on pages 2 and 3.
The Group is organised into three operating divisions н Shipbroking, Technical and Logistics. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information. The reportable segments are derived from an aggregation of operating segments. Unallocated costs relate to Board costs and other costs associated with the Group's listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Divisional operating profit is defined as operating profit before acquisition-related expenses and amortisation, non-recurring items and unallocated costs.
Sales between and within business segments are carried out at an arm's-length basis.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles including additions resulting from business acquisitions.
Segment assets consist primarily of intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, receivables and other assets. Receivables for taxes, cash and cash equivalents and investments have been excluded. Segment liabilities relate to the operating activities and exclude liabilities for taxes and borrowings.

The segment information provided to the Board for reportable segments for the year ended 29 February 2016 is as follows:

The closing deferred tax liability includes г67,000 (2015: г198,000) expected to reverse within the next 12 months of the balance sheet date.

No deferred tax has been provided in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, is approximately г3.4 million (2015: г2.8 million).

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 29 February 2016 of 17 pence per share which will absorb an estimated г5.0 million of shareholders' funds. It will be paid on 29 July 2016 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 1 July 2016. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

The right to receive dividends on the shares held in the ESOP has been waived (see Note 26). The dividend saving through the waiver is г181,000 (2015: г177,000).

11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding 760,409 ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans (2015: 814,367 shares) which are treated as cancelled.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has one class of potential dilutive ordinary shares being those options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the year.

13 Goodwill continued All recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use. The forecast cash flows were based on the approved annual budget for the next financial year and management projections for the following four years which are based on estimated conservative growth rates for revenue and costs. Management believe any improvements in the cash flow are achievable. Cash flows have been used over a period of five years as management believes this reflects a reasonable time horizon for management to monitor the trends in the business. After five years a terminal value is calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0% (2015: 2.0%). The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.1% (2015: 9.1%) for UK-based operations and 9.1% to 9.6% (2015: 9.1% to 11.1%) for overseas-based operations.

Sensitivity to impairment To test the sensitivity of the results of the impairment review, the calculations have been re-performed assuming a long-term growth rate of nil%. The results showed that there was still no indication of impairment.

Other intangible assets relate to forward books of income acquired in acquisitions which are being amortised over the period that the income is being recognised; customer relationships which are amortised over a period of five years; and brand which is being amortised over ten years.
In 2014/15 the Group capitalised г2,783,000 for the forward book of revenue in connection with the acquisition of ACM Shipping Group plc which was calculated as the net present value of future net income to be generated from this forward book. No value was attributed to the value of the brand or customer relationships as the primary value from the business combination was associated with the value of the experienced workforce acquired and the synergies created.
The Company has no intangible assets.

The share capital of Braemar Quincannon Pte Limited was owned by the Company. All other joint ventures were or are indirectly owned by the Group.

The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed.

b) Unlisted investments The Group's unlisted investments include 1,200 (2015: 1,200) ordinary г1 shares in London Tanker Brokers Panel and 7,500 (2015: 7,500) ordinary г1 shares in London Ship Valuation Panel. The Group also has an investment in the Baltic Exchange. These have been treated as available for sale investments and not equity accounted, as the Group does not have significant influence as all investors in these companies have equivalent proportional influence. The fair value of the investment in London Tanker Brokers Panel is not quoted on a market, but was revalued during 2014/15 to г1,200,000.

18 Trade and other receivables continued The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of trade receivables approximate to their fair value.

Terms associated with the settlement of the Group's trade receivables vary across the Group but in general are settled in less than 90 days. As at 29 February 2016 trade receivables of г6,071,000 (2015: г4,477,000) which were over 12 months old were treated as impaired and have been provided for. Amounts over 12 months old at 29 February 2016 have not been provided for if they have been recovered since that date. No further provision (2015: гnil) has been made for specific trade receivables less than 12 months overdue.

At 29 February 2016, within other classes of trade and other receivables, a provision of impairment of г311,000 (2015: г318,000) has been made for accrued income that is greater than 12 months old and within other receivables there is a provision for impairment of г250,000 (2015: г250,000).

19 Derivative and other financial instruments a) Currency risk The Group's currency risk exposure arises as a result of the majority of its Shipbroking earnings being denominated in US dollars while the majority of its costs are denominated in pounds sterling and from the carrying values of its overseas subsidiaries being denominated in foreign currencies. The Group manages the exposure to currency variations by spot and forward currency sales and other derivative currency contracts.

At 29 February 2016 the Group held forward currency contracts to sell US$31.0 million at an average rate of $1.477/г1.

At 28 February 2015 the Group held forward currency contracts to sell US$12.0 million at an average rate of $1.557/г1.

The net fair value of forward currency contracts that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amount to a г1,233,000 liability (2015: г62,000 liability) which has been deferred in equity.
Amounts of г62,000 have been charged (2015: г35,000 credited) to the income statement in respect of forward contracts which have matured in the period.
The fair value of financial instruments is based on prices quoted by the counterparty (level 2) at the balance sheet date.

b) Interest rate risk The Group minimises its exposure to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents by pooling sterling cash balances across the UK Group.

The Group has not entered into any financial instruments to fix or hedge the interest rates applied to its bank borrowings and overdrafts.

The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Group's financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk:

19 Derivative and other financial instruments continued c) Credit risk There are no significant concentrations within the Group or Company.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the diversity of the Group's customer base. The Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provisions for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group's management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. The Group seeks to trade only with creditworthy parties and carries out credit checks where appropriate. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 18.

d) Capital management The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group considers its capital as consisting of ordinary shares and retained earnings. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

The Group has a policy of maintaining positive cash balances with additional headroom if required through an overdraft facility. This provides cover against the highly cyclical nature of the shipping industry and sufficient cash resources to take advantage of opportunities to acquire businesses that complement the overall strategy of the Group.

The Board monitors the return on capital and underlying business performance to determine the ongoing use of capital, namely executive and staff incentive schemes (and whether to fund this through cash or share incentives); acquisition appraisals ahead of potential business combinations; investment in property, plant and equipment; and the level of dividends.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 29 February 2016 and 28 February 2015.

Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise bank balances denominated in sterling, euro and other currencies for the purpose of settling current liabilities.

Restricted cash comprises cash balances where the Group is holding cash as escrow agent or where there are restrictions as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain financial instruments (see Note 31). The amounts are held in designated accounts.

The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of these assets approximate to their fair value.

Short-term borrowings comprise the net bank overdraft facility repayable on demand or within twelve months together with the long-term borrowing amounts due for settlement within one year.

The Group operates a pooled banking facility for all sterling, US dollar and euro current account balances across the UK group and has the legal right of offset. The Company's short-term borrowings reflect its contribution to the pooling arrangement.

The bank overdraft bears interest based on LIBOR.

For all other borrowings, the Directors consider that the fair value of this liability is approximate to the carrying amount.

Borrowing facilities As at 29 February 2016, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of г10 million (2015: г5.0 million). Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required. The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year.

During April 2016, the Group entered a new banking relationship with HSBC. This provided total facilities of г30 million, made up of a revolving credit facility of г15 million and an accordion facility of г15 million. HSBC also provides access to global cash management opportunities, notably in our regional hubs of UK, Singapore and Australia.

Covenant measures The covenant measures are tested on a quarterly rolling twelve-month basis and consist of a leverage covenant and an interest cover charge covenant. The leverage covenant is a measure of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation compared to total debt. The interest cover covenant is a measure of earnings before interest, tax and amortisation compared to finance charges. The leverage and interest cover covenant hurdles are 2.5x and 4.0x respectively.

Other provisions include onerous leases and provisions for staff redundancies incurred following the restructuring of the ACM acquisition.

The Company has no provisions.

24 Retirement benefit schemes Pension schemes for the employees of the Group consist of a funded defined benefit scheme and defined contribution plans. The retirement benefit obligations in the Group balance sheets relate to the funded defined benefit scheme н The ACM Staff Pension Scheme. A funding valuation as at 31 March 2014 was carried out.

The Group's obligations in respect of the funded defined benefit scheme at 29 February 2016 were as follows:

Funded defined benefit scheme The Group sponsors a funded defined benefit scheme (The ACM Staff Pension Scheme) for qualifying UK employees. The Scheme is administered by a separate board of trustees which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement at age 60 of one-sixtieth of final pensionable salary for each year of service. Pensionable salary is defined as basic salary plus the average of the previous three years' bonuses (capped at three times basic salary). Pensionable salaries for members who joined after 1 June 1989 are also restricted to an earnings cap. Other benefits are payable, for example those provided on death.
From 1 February 2016, post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees through a separate defined contribution arrangement.
Profile of the Scheme The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners. Broadly, around 80% of the liabilities are attributable to deferred pensions for current and former employees, with the remaining 20% to current pensioners.
The Scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made. For the Scheme as a whole, the duration is around 18 years.
Funding implications UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2014 and showed a deficit of г3.7 million. As a result, the Company has been paying deficit contributions of г450,000 p.a. since July 2015 which, along with investment returns from return-seeking assets, are expected to make good this shortfall by February 2026.
Risks associated with the Scheme The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:
Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Scheme's long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme's liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme's bond holdings.

Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2016

82/83
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Scheme's benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.

Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme's obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

The Company and Trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes moving assets to match pensioner liabilities when members reach retirement.

The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension ("GMP"). The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the plan. At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.

Actuarial assumptions The Scheme's assets are stated at their market values on the balance sheet date. The overall expected rates of return upon assets reflect the risk-free rate of return plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category.

The principal assumptions used for updating the latest valuation of the scheme were:

Discount rate RPI inflation CPI inflation Rate of salary growth

3.8 2.9 1.8 3.9

2015 (% p.a.)

Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Scheme liabilities at 29 February 2016 to changes in the principal assumptions. The sensitivities assume that all other assumptions remain unchanged and the calculations are approximate (full calculations could lead to a different result).

Assumption

Change in assumption

Impact on Scheme liabilities

Discount rate Rate of inflation(i) Life expectancy

Increase by 0.1% p.a. Decrease by 0.1% p.a.
Increase by 0.1% p.a. Decrease by 0.1% p.a.
Increase by one year Decrease by one year

Decrease by 1.8% Increase by 1.8%
Increase by 1.5% Decrease by 1.4%
Increase by 1.6% Decrease by 1.7%

(i)The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the CPI and the RPI, and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.

Defined contribution schemes There are a number of defined contribution schemes in the Group, the principal scheme being the Braemar Pension Scheme, which is open to all UK employees. Cash contributions paid into the defined contribution schemes are accounted for as an income statement expense as they are incurred. The total charge for the year in respect of this and other defined contribution schemes amounted to г2,083,000 (2015: г2,156,000).

Contributions of г84,000 were due to these schemes at 29 February 2016 (2015: г73,000).

The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees.

25 Share capital continued c) Share-based payments The Company operates a variety of share-based payment schemes which are listed below.

i. Share options The Company operates employee save-as-you-earn option schemes called the Braemar Seascope Group plc 2003 SavingsRelated Share Option Scheme ("the SAYE Scheme") and the Braemar Shipping Services plc 2008 International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme ("the International SAYE Scheme"). No option may be granted under either scheme which would result in the total number of shares issued or remaining issuable under all of the schemes (or any other Group share schemes), in the ten-year period ending on the date of grant of the option, exceeding 10% of the Company's issued share capital (calculated at the date of grant of the relevant option). Options are granted at a 20% discount to the prevailing market price.

The Company also operates the Braemar Shipping Services 2010 Executive Options Scheme ("the 2010 CSOP") under which options are granted by the Remuneration Committee. The schemes are open to all UK employees and executive Directors and the exercise price of the options granted were at the market price at date of grant. The 2010 CSOP provides for the grant of two types of option н "Non-performance options" and "Performance options". "Non-performance options" are granted to employees only in conjunction with the grant to such employees of an award under the Deferred Bonus Plan (see ii). Unlike the "Performance Options", the vesting and exercise of "Non-performance options" will not be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions (although exercise will be dependent on continuous employment within the Group). During the year to 29 February 2016, 295,959 "Non-performance options" and 142,836 "Performance options" were granted under the CSOP (2015: 283,851 "Non-performance options" and 151,233 "Performance options").

Details of the share options in issue and the movements in the year are given below:

The weighted average share price for share options exercised in the year is 464.37 pence (2015: 467.71 pence).
ii. Deferred bonus plan In 2005 the Company put in place a Deferred Bonus Plan ("the Plan") whereby part of the annual performance-related bonus is delivered in shares, on a discretionary basis, to staff including executive Directors. Under the Plan the shares are bought and held in an employee trust for three years after which the employee beneficiary will become absolutely entitled to the shares provided they remain in employment. Shares are valued at fair value at the date of grant.
During the year ended 29 February 2016, 139,238 shares at a value of г600,000 that were awarded to employees in May 2012 as part of the Plan were delivered to them in May 2015 following the three-year vesting period. Awards over 438,795 shares were made to employees during the year and a total of 105,807 share awards lapsed.
During the year ended 28 February 2015, 22,750 shares at a value of г76,000 that were awarded to employees in May 2011 as part of the Plan were delivered to them in May 2014 following the three-year vesting period. Awards over 435,084 shares were made to employees during the year and a total of 251,075 share awards lapsed.
As at 29 February 2016, 1,078,096 deferred shares had been awarded to employees (2015: 822,641) but not yet vested.
iii. Long-term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") The Company established an LTIP in 2006. LTIP awards under this plan took the form of a conditional right to receive shares at nil cost. The awards normally vested over three years and were subject to a performance condition based on earnings per share (EPS). If EPS increased by RPI plus 4%, the awards vested up to 50% and if EPS increased by 10% they vested up to 100% with a sliding scale in between.
In 2014, the performance criteria of the LTIP were updated such that the awards vested over a three-year period based on growth in EPS. If EPS increases by less than 5% then the awards do not vest; if EPS increases by 5% the awards vest by 25%; and if EPS increases by 13% or higher the awards vest 100%, with a sliding scale on a straight-line basis between these growth percentages. In June 2015, awards over 143,157 awards were made to two executive directors and one senior member of management. In August 2014, awards over 156,812 awards were made to three executive Directors.
During the year LTIP awards over 130,000 shares that were made to two executive Directors in October 2012 lapsed due to the performance criteria not being met.
iv. Restricted share plan During the year ended 28 February 2015, the Company established a Restricted Share Plan ("RSP"). RSP awards are made in the form of a nil cost option and there are no performance criteria other than continued employment. During the year ended 28 February 2015 the Company issued 1,409,000 RSP awards of which 50% will vest after three years and 25% after each of the fourth and fifth years provided the individuals remain employed by the Group. At 29 February 2016, 171,500 awards had lapsed. During the year ended 29 February 2016 a further 315,000 RSP awards were granted of which 50% will vest after three years and 25% after each of the fourth and fifth years provided the individuals remain employed by the Group.

Shares to be issued are a deduction from shareholders' funds and represent a reduction in distributable reserves.

An Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) was established on 23 January 1995. The ESOP has been set up to purchase shares in the Company. These shares, once purchased, are held on trust by the Trustee of the ESOP, Kleinwort Benson (Channel Islands) Limited, for the benefit of the employees. As at 29 February 2016, the ESOP held 634,788 (2015: 688,746) ordinary shares of 10 pence each at a total cost of г3,439,000 (2015: г3,611,000) including stamp duty associated with the purchase. The funding of the purchase has been provided by the Company in the form of an interest-free loan and the Trustees have contracted with the Company to waive the ESOP's right to receive dividends. The fees charged by the Trustees for the operation of the ESOP are paid by the Company and charged to the income statement as they fall due.

In addition, as part of the acquisition of ACM Shipping Group plc, the Company issued 125,621 shares into an Employee Trust (EBT) previously run by ACM Shipping Group plc.

The shares owned by the ESOP and EBT had a market value at 29 February 2016 of г3,140,579 (2015: г3,746,088). The distribution of these shares is determined by the Remuneration Committee. 139,238 shares (2015: 27,224) have been released to employees during the year (see Note 25).

The capital redemption reserve arose on previous share buy-backs by the Company.
The merger reserve arose principally in 2001 in relation to acquisitions of Braemar Shipbrokers and Braemar Tankers.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred of г1,233,000 liability (2015: г62,000 liability). A deferred tax asset of г247,000 (2015: г12,000 asset) is attributable to these transactions.

There are no bank guarantees issued by the Company.

In addition the Company and certain of its UK subsidiaries have provided cross guarantees and fixed and floating rate charges over their assets to secure their borrowing facilities and other financial instruments (see Note 22).

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension ("GMP"). The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the plan. At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.

Under the Merger Agreement dated 7 March 2001 between the Company and Braemar Shipbrokers Ltd, the vendors gave a joint and several indemnity to the Company for any warranty and tax indemnity claims up to an aggregate of г10 million. The former Chief Executive, Alan Marsh, and a former Director of the Company, Quentin Soanes are Braemar Shipbrokers vendors. During the year ended 28 February 2006, the Company received an assessment for corporation tax and interest totalling г2.2 million which is recoverable under the above indemnity. Following receipt of the assessment the Company received funds of г1.6 million from the vendors which were paid to the Inland Revenue in order to prevent interest accruing. Such funds would become repayable to the vendors in the event that the appeal is successful. г0.6 million (2015: г0.6 million) remains outstanding pending the appeal result. The assessment is being appealed and the Company does not expect to incur any cost in respect of this assessment or these contingent liabilities.
Key management compensation is disclosed in Note 4.
