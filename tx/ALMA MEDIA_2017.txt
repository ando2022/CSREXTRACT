international business in Sweden, the
Baltic countries and Eastern Central Europe consists of recruitment services, financial and trade publications, an online marketplace for commercial properties and telemarketing services.

Our ongoing transformation into a provider of digital services began in the mid-1990s. In 2017, digital business accounted for 43 per cent of our revenue. We have been particularly successful in the digitalisation of our national media products and our expansion in Eastern Central Europe. Digitalisation presents many opportunities to us ­ our services are available to our customers in exactly the manner they want to use them, regardless of time and place.
We are building sustainable media and responsibility is an integral aspect of our operations. By providing high-quality independent media content, we act as a responsible member of society.

CEO's Review
Alma M edia continued on the path of strong organic growth in 2017. The factors behind the excellent development in financial performance included the growing digital business, internationalisation and closer internal cooperation.

In 2017, Alma M edia's revenue increased by four per cent to 367 million euros and the Group's adjusted operating profit grew by 45 per cent to 51 million euros. All three of the long-term financial targets we set a few years ago were reached ahead of schedule.
All of Alma M edia's business segments improved their result during the year, for the first time in a decade. Alma Markets again led the way in growth and the development of profitability in 2017. In Alma News & Life, digital advertising saw strong growth and reached a record level at the end of the year. In Alma Talent, the planned and promised cost

synergies of the Talentum merger were achieved in full. The positive development of the Alma Regions segment was achieved through cost savings that compensated for the decline in media sales. The profit performance of the business segments reflects the broad transformation of the media sector: digital businesses performed very well, while businesses that are still dependent on print media revenue and are in earlier stages of their digital transformation saw slower development.
In spite of the rapid growth of the Finnish economy, the advertising market in Finland remained subdued in 2017.

According to TNS Kantar, investments in media advertising fell by 2.8 per cent to EUR 0.9 billion during the year. Alma Media's domestic media sales grew by 2.7 per cent over the same period of time. This growth in market share was due to strong performance in content and mobile marketing as well as the programmatic buying market. International platform operators account for around half of the Finnish digital advertising market. Together with other Finnish media companies, we nevertheless achieved a defensive victory when the international operators' share of digital advertising did not grow in Finland last year, unlike in many other countries.
An increasingly significant share of Alma Media's growth comes from international business. Our operations in Eastern Central Europe grew, supported by favourable economic development, and achieved a very good level of profitability for the year. Our international units have also been active in building new growth initiatives through successful product development. In 2017, our operations outside of Finland accounted for 23 per cent of our revenue and 39 per cent of our adjusted operating profit.
Our digital transformation is progressing well, but we are only halfway there. In 2017, digital business represented 43 per cent of our revenue, or 157 million euros. We continued the development and renewal of our digital content

services in many different publishing channels in 2017, including online TV and radio. Cross-segment joint initiatives and close cooperation at the Alma Media level are integral aspects of our digital transformation. In 2017, we revamped our digital advertising distribution system and developed new and innovative digital advertising solutions. One of our key joint initiatives was establishing the joint eCom team between the business units to develop digital subscription sales as well as increase and share knowledge related to content e-commerce. We also enhanced our IT-related capacity for the responsible utilisation of data, taking into account the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which will take effect at the beginning of May.
Alma Media's growth is driven by our people. They also ensure our continued competitiveness in the future. In 2017, learning and development were incorporated into the personal targets of every Alma Media employee. We placed special emphasis on the recruitment of digital developers and launched our first trainee programme for developers.
Alma Media's purpose is to boost the sustainable growth of companies, individuals and society. One of our most important functions is to produce responsible and reliable journalism while preventing the spread of fake news and disinformation.

"An increasingly
significant share of
Alma Media's growth
comes from international
business. "
In 2017, we defined corporate responsibility objectives to guide our responsibility-related efforts, and we planned measures to follow through on our commitments related to sustainable business. As a company, Alma Media is committed to, among other things, supporting the universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption laid out in the United Nations Global Compact initiative. We are also committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warmest thanks to all of our stakeholders for their excellent co operation in 2017 as well as Alma Media's employees for their strong performance and dedication to achieving our shared goals.

Strategic development areas and related achievements in 2017

The focus areas in the development of Alma Media's current business operations in 2017 were multi-channel content, marketing and advertising solutions, services and improving resources and competencies.

CONTENT
OBJECTIVE Retaining our current level of content revenue through high-quality print and digital content. Alma Media seeks growth in the digital content sales of its media products to compensate for the declining subscription revenue from print-based media. The aim is to achieve user growth in digital content products as well as increase the consumption of content.

ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2017
· Various actions were taken to increase the subscriber numbers and use of digital content products. Among other things, the Group established a joint eCom team between the business units to develop digital subscription sales as well as increase and share knowledge related to e-commerce. Aamulehti strengthened its content aimed at subscribers and launched paid Tähtijuttu star stories for readers online. The Talouselämä and Arvopaperi online services were redesigned and their digital contents were partly moved behind paywalls.
· The offering for consumers of content services was developed and redesigned on several different publishing channels. A new weather application, Paras sää ("The Best Weather") was launched for Iltalehti's weather service. Kauppalehti introduced the KL Assistant chatbot news service on the Facebook Messenger platform. The print editions of Talouselämä and Optio were redesigned.
· Alma M edia responded to the rapid growth in the consumption of online video by developing the video services of Iltalehti and Aamulehti, among others. IL-TV launched the web TV talk show Päivärinta Uncensored. The show and clips taken from

it have produced hundreds of thousands of weekly video starts and an even higher number of page loads. · The Group began producing radio news. Iltalehti started producing radio news for Radio Nostalgia, Business FM and Bauer Media's largest radio stations: Radio Nova and Iskelmä. Aamulehti produces news content for Radio 957, a Tampere-based radio station that has been brought back to life by Bauer Media. · Several projects were carried out in the area of robotic journalism. Alma Media is involved in Immersive Automation, a project led by the University of Helsinki and Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. A news robot developed by the project produced news on election results based on data provided by the Ministry of Justice. Aamulehti introduced a bot that scans City of Tampere agendas for keywords specified by the editorial team. Robot journalism is also utilised in financial statements analyses produced by Alma Talent and in financial news coverage to automatically update different types of dynamic elements, such as share prices and visualisations.

RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE
OBJECTIVE Together we are more agile. Internal cooperation will be increased within the Group. Alma M edia has efficient back-end systems and processes, strategic partnerships and the ability to make use of improving employee competencies in various business operations as needed. In addition, content cooperation and directing visitor traffic create a significant advantage for Alma Media's businesses. Alma Media will improve the recognisability of its brand and key products among consumers and advertisers.

ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2017
· The process of increasing the Group's digital business competence was accelerated through employee training as well as managerial development programmes. To strengthen technical competencies, Alma launched a trainee programme, with 10 trainees selected for various technical roles.
· The Group continued to prepare for the changes brought about by regulatory reforms in the area of data protection. Among other things, the Group appointed a data protection officer, audited business functions and carried out training related to data protection.
· Cooperation between the Group's units was increased in various system and development projects. The Group established a steering group focused on the directing of visitor traffic. Through various development measures, the steering group aims to increase the user volumes of the Group's digital services as well as the regularity of their use. Another new initiative was the Group-wide Alma ID project to create a single user authentication system for customers across Alma's various services. In addition to delivering a better user experience, the project creates the conditions for improving the legal protection of authenticated customers of our services in compliance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

· The use of data and analytics in advertising sales, content production and business development was improved in the business units and the Group's joint development projects. In early 2018, it was announced that Alma will deploy the Data Management Platform (DMP). The deployment of the platform will strengthen the development of the data-driven customer experience of Alma's content and services as well as marketing automation and the targeting of digital advertising.
· Restructuring measures, acquisitions and divestments were carried out in the area of content services. In the Alma Regions business unit, Pohjolan Sanomat and Lapin Kansa were merged to create a single media brand called Lapin Kansa. The Pohjolan Sanomat brand and the separate edition of the newspaper were discontinued. Three local papers published in Northern Ostrobothnia ­ Raahen Seutu, Raahelainen and Pyhäjokiseutu ­ were sold to Kaleva365 Oy, a subsidiary of Kaleva. Alma Talent strengthened its professional content offering by acquiring full ownership of Mediuutiset, having previously held a 50% stake. In Sweden, Alma Talent acquired Personnel & Lederskap, the leading Swedish publication specialising in human resource management.

Responsibility at the core of business
In accordance with its strategy, Alma Media creates added value for its stakeholders through building sustainable growth by taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.

This goal is also reflected in how Alma M edia promotes its corporate responsibility: Alma M edia's sustainability efforts are increasingly focused on the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital transformation of its business.
The transformation of the media industry has already been underway for quite some time in the area of content production, with the circulations of printed newspapers declining as a result of changes in media behaviour among consumers. The public debate on digital content has seen a new theme in recent years with the growing concerns regarding the impacts of fake news on social climate and stability. This is currently a major topic of discussion within the media industry, and it is a concern that is also shared by many other Alma M edia stakeholders.
In response to the debate surrounding fake news, Alma M edia makes long-term investments in developing the competence of its employees; for example, by providing various coaching programmes to employees to reinforce high-quality journalism and by offering opportunities for on-the-job learning and job rotation. The aim is to ensure that all Alma M edia employees working in editorial teams and media sales have the capacity to operate responsibly and professionally in the digital media environment, which calls for new competencies from those who participate in it. Each year, Alma M edia also invests in technologies that, among other things, enhance the monitoring and management of digital advertising materials and prevent data protection and information security problems related to the processing of customer data.
Investments in technology and competence development support Alma M edia's goal of strengthening and diversifying its media offering. At the same time, they ensure that Alma M edia can compete in a job market characterised by intense competition between employers, particularly for talented digital professionals.

Stakeholder interaction

Stakeholder interaction constitutes the foundation of Alma M edia's business and is a central aspect of the company's day-to-day operations.

As a media company, Alma Media must fulfil the expectations of its stakeholders every day. It must ensure that readers and service users, customers and other stakeholders can trust the company as well as the content and services published by Alma Media.
Actively managed and transparent relationships with different stakeholders are one way to ensure that Alma Media maintains its stakeholders' trust and responds to their various expectations. At Alma M edia, stakeholder interaction is led by the Senior Vice President in charge of the development of Alma Media's branding, communications, investor relations and corporate responsibility, along with the rest of the Group Executive Team. In addition, Alma M edia's various units regularly monitor the stakeholder feedback r eceived by employees, such as c ustomer service representatives, the media sales representatives who work with advertisers as well as journalists.
Advocacy work in society Alma Media also manages its stakeholder relationships by being actively

involved in associations and cooperative bodies. The goal is to survey changes in Alma Media's industry and in relation to corporate responsibility.
As part of the development of its corporate responsibility and advocacy work, Alma M edia is a member of organisations such as the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), Central Chamber of Commerce, Finnish Business and S ociety (FIBS), the FIBS diversity network, the City of Helsinki climate network and Responsible Media Forum.
In addition to these, many members of Alma Media's Management Team and managers and experts hold board memberships in the Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland, Finnmedia, Media Metrics Finland, the Finnish News A gency and Lehtikuva picture agency, as well as IAB Finland, an association that promotes the growth and development of digital marketing and advertising. Furthermore, in 2016­2018 Alma Media is a key partner of the Finnish Children and Youth Foundation.

Alma Markets
Alma Markets achieved another excellent result in 2017. The basic business was supported by the continued strong economic development in Eastern Central Europe and the Finnish economy returning to growth, but business was also increased by active sales efforts and the expansion of the product portfolio.

The recruitment business constitutes a major part of the Alma Media Group's international operations. The Alma Markets segment operates in the recruitment business in ten European countries and it is the market leader in seven of them. The Group's subsidiaries in the recruitment business operate locally under their own brands and they have very high brand awareness in their respective countries. This industry leadership and Alma Markets' compe titiveness are based on understanding the culture of the local working life and changes therein as well as the ability to quickly react to local customer needs by delivering customised products and services. Another key element is the Alma Career network of recruitment business countries: it facilitates cooperation and learning as well as the duplicating and leveraging of best practices to further develop the product portfolio.
Economic growth continued in Eastern Central Europe in 2017. The thriving labour markets in the region supported

the development of the Alma Markets segment's digital recruitment business. The Finnish economy returning to growth was also reflected favourably in Alma Markets' recruitment business. Among the Alma Markets segment's operating countries, growth was the fastest in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and C roatia. Alma Markets invested in the future by hiring new employees, particularly in sales, and by strengthening the brand awareness of its recruitment services through investments in marketing.
Economic growth in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been the fastest in the EU in several of the past few years, and their labour markets are highly active. However, strong economic growth and thriving labour markets can also reduce jobseeker activity and the number of job applications. Various services have been introduced to activate jobseekers. For example, Prace za Rohem, a mobile service that provides information on vacancies based on geographic proximity, is very popular in the Czech

Republic. Alma Markets also launched the employer rating service Atmoskop during the year.
In the Czech Republic, the job advertising business has been successfully complemented by the training business. One example of this is the Seduo.cz online platform, which offers a comprehensive range of courses aimed at the needs of working life.
Alma Markets pursues organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions. During the reporting year, the Group's Croatian subsidiary, Tau on-line, acquired a 30% minority interest in Vrabotuvanje Online, the leading online recruitment service in Macedonia.
Media is becoming a service Alma Markets has a long history of providing clients with not only media advertising opportunities, but also business management tools and services. Real estate agents have access to a brokering system and information

The competitive advantages of Alma Markets are its superior brand awareness and agile development organisations that are highly familiar with the local markets in several of the segment's operating countries.
services. Recruitment business operations have invested in HR consulting and recruitment systems, for example.

new concept will include content and services that span the various stages of buying and moving to a new home: from dreaming about it to buying a new home and selling the old one, and extending all the way to moving into the new home and decorating it. The mobile version of the redesigned service was launched in autumn 2017. The goal is also supported by the acquisitions made during the year. Alma M ediapartners acquired full ownership of the renovation and construction marketplace Urakkamaailma.fi during the year. Alma M ediapartners previously held a 51% stake in the service. Alma M ediapartners also acquired a 25% minority interest in Muuttomaailma.fi, a competitive bidding platform for moving and relocation services, to complement its service offering.
Consumers are increasingly looking to use competitive bidding for their purchases and share their experiences of different service providers on online platforms. Autotalli.com launched a new mobility service in 2017 to give consumers a comprehensive overview of the various ways of gaining access to a car without ownership and to allow them to compare the relevant costs and operating models. In January 2018, Alma Markets strengthened its automotive service offering by acquiring the entire share capital of Autojerry.fi, a competitive bidding platform for car servicing, and Katsastushinnat.fi, an online service for comparing vehicle inspection services.

The aim of the marketplace business is to expand from the buying and selling of homes to provide a comprehensive range of housing-related services, and to expand from automotive services to mobility services in a broader sense.
Cornerstones of operations
· Active product development geared towards a better user experience or entirely new services with new revenue sources and revenue generation models.
· Continuous development of employees and operating methods, particularly by utilising best practices developed in different countries.

Alma Talent
Created by the merger of Alma Media and Talentum, the Alma Talent segment had its first official year of operations in 2017. After completing the integration project early in the year, the segment shifted its focus to normal business development with an emphasis on digital development. The segment's result for the year exceeded targets and the cost synergies expected from the merger were achieved.

In early 2017, Alma Talent developed its strategy with respect to the post-integration business unit's business portfolio, synergies, organisation and management. Alma Talent has a unique target group: its media channels and services reach two million influencers in Finland and Sweden. Going forward, Alma Talent also has a good opportunity to increase the value of content products by linking digital subscriptions with digital book contents or other database contents, for example.
Alma Talent's key objective is to rapidly move towards digital media and service business models. Increasing content revenue is a particular goal and the business segment's aim is that, in 2020, all Alma Talent media in Finland and Sweden will be paid media, also in the digital format.
The first development project under Alma Talent's new digital strategy was the redesigned Arvopaperi online service launched in January 2017. The redesign

saw some of the articles on the website moved behind a paywall, accessible only to subscribers. The Talouselämä website was also redesigned during the year. In line with the strategy, content is made easily accessible across various channels, allowing the customer to decide whether to consume it in print or digital format. Kauppalehti also introduced subscriber-only Tähtijuttu star stories as part of the productisation of its content sales. All of these changes are aimed at increasing digital content revenue, which the segment achieved as planned in 2017.
Another example of digital development in 2017 was the KL Assistant, a K auppalehti chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform. KL Assistant delivers Kauppalehti news related to the reader's selected topics via the Messenger application or the Facebook message window at times specified by the reader. The goals of the KL Assistant project are to gather experiences of this new way of reading the news and to increase audience commitment.

Kauppalehti Optio celebrated its 30th anniversary by redesigning its content and visual appearance.
On the acquisition front, Alma Media took over full ownership of Mediuutiset during the year. Mediuutiset is an independent health care news media company for physicians, medical professionals and decision-makers that also organises industry events and seminars. Alma Talent previously held a 50% ownership share of Mediuutiset Oy.
Alma Talent Pro invested in digital information content and increased its cooperation with other Alma Talent units in areas such as the marketing and sales of products and services. The business of paid events and training developed particularly well in 2017, with some 6,500 people participating in 500 events and training functions. The online store of Alma Talent Pro, Finland's largest publisher of business books, was also redesigned during the year. In the training and book publishing business,

Alma Talent relies heavily on paid digital content and high-quality journalism. In 2017, the online editions of Arvopaperi and Talouselämä were redesigned and their contents were expanded. At the same time, some of the digital content was moved behind a paywall.

cooperation with expert authors in Alma Talent Pro's high-quality training modules was also found to be an effective operating model.
In Kauppalehti Business Information Services, investments in property information services and their development produced good results. Profitability was also improved by cost reduction measures carried out in the unit in 2017.
Significant restructuring measures were implemented in the Swedish media business in the previous year. The implemented measures helped bring about an upturn in the company's result. The next step is to seek new revenue through digital product development.
For the direct marketing unit S uoramarkkinointi Mega, the year was stable. The company continues to operate as an independent unit and it has not been functionally integrated with Alma Talent.

Alma News & Life
Digital advertising continued to see strong growth in Alma News & Life in 2017.

The strategy of the Alma News & Life business segment is based on the growth of digital media, increasing cash flow from advertising-funded digital media and the growth of the service business. The chosen focus areas were clearly reflected in the development of the Alma News & Life business in 2017. Digital business now constitutes approximately half of the segment's revenue.
Iltalehti accounts for the majority of the Alma News & Life segment's revenue and digital advertising. Iltalehti's high reach and diversity of target audiences, combined with the investments made by Alma Media in recent years in the automation and effectiveness of advertising, were the factors contributing to the segment's growth in 2017. The growth of digital advertising in Alma News & Life has outpaced the market. With respect to advertising, good results have been achieved particularly in programmatic buying and mobile marketing, such as optimised rich media implementations. Growth has also been achieved through content marketing. Alma Media and the Alma News & Life segment's lifestyle media represented a growing share of content marketing production. The general decline in TV

advertising was reflected in an increase in video advertising, also in Iltalehti.
Iltalehti's single-copy sales ­ the content revenue of the printed newspaper ­ declined, but not by as much as expected. Revenue from Iltalehti's special supplements increased slightly.
Iltalehti has adjusted its news profile and news content from traditional tabloid journalism towards higher-quality content produced by special editorial teams and current affairs teams. In 2017, the scope of news content was developed, particularly with respect to international news and domestic politics. Iltalehti has also invested in news applications, which are seen as a key tool for creating audience loyalty as content consumption increasingly moves to social media platforms. Iltalehti's news application was made more picture-oriented and significant steps were also taken in publishing technology during the year, which are expected to be reflected in a better user experience and reliability of service. One example of new applications launched during the year is the Iltalehti weather application. Iltalehti continued its multi-channel evolution as a news brand. At the

beginning of 2017, it began producing radio news for Radio Nostalgia and Business FM. At the end of the year, these operations were expanded to cover Radio Nova and Radio Iskelmä. Radio Nova is Finland's most popular commercial radio station with 1.3 million weekly listeners. Iskelmä has over 700,000 listeners a week. (National Radio Survey, KRT).
IL-TV has established its position as one of Finland's most popular online TV channels, with 6,000,000 video starts per week. In 2017, Iltalehti also launched its first online talk show, Päivärinta Uncensored, which has been well received. At its peak, the audience for journalist Susanne Päivärinta's weekly live IL-TV talk show has exceeded 500 000 video starts, boosting the growth of Iltalehti's video advertising. In December 2017, Päivärinta Uncensored was selected as one of the three finalists in the talk show category in the Golden Venla Awards organised by the Finnish Television Academy. IL-TV also increased its live TV broadcasts late in the year following agreements signed with CNN and Reuters. Around the same time, ILTV made a promising start to smartphone-based live broadcasts.

The automation of advertising has benefited Iltalehti, a newspaper with a high reach and diverse content.

In addition to evolving as a news media brand, Iltalehti has become a strong and increasingly well-known lifestyle media brand. Its content related to health, fashion, housing, travel and cars have found traction with their demanding audiences. One example of this success is Iltalehti's health editor Heljä Salonen being named Science Journalist of the Year in Finland.

Iltalehti has quickly become a major lifestyle media brand that is important to its readers.

The service business was dominated in 2017 by investments in the Matkapörssi service's new reservation system technology. The new-look online store makes it easy to buy package tours, flights and hotel accommodation from any device. Additional services, such as transport services, seat reservations and travel insurance, can also be bought as part of the booking process. Although the system updates were delayed due to technical problems, the travel services Matkapörssi and R antapallo achieved a satisfactory result. The E-Kontakti dating service continued to see growth among the older age groups and maintained its robust profitability. Marketing cooperation with the Alma Markets segment's consumer services was developed further in Finland. The unit strengthened its human resources in the areas of content, marketing and technology.

Cornerstones of operations
· Multi-channel news and lifestyle media whose large audience enables it to have a strong position as a digital advertising medium.
· Active development of digital services that fit the publication profile.

Alma Regions
Alma Regions continued to have a strong focus on the digital transformation of services as well as selling services to consumers and businesses in 2017. The business segment also implemented significant measures to improve profitability.

While the majority of Alma Regions' revenue is still derived from printed newspapers, the digital transformation moved ahead on several fronts in Alma M edia's regional and local media in 2017. Digital subscriptions have increased in line with targets. At the same time, the majority of print subscribers have become active consumers of digital content in accordance with the business segment's paid content strategy.
The trend in the circulation of printed newspapers has been better than expected. Combined with increased subscription prices, this meant that Alma Regions' content revenue was substantially higher in 2017 than in the previous year.
The development of digital advertising sales also outpaced the overall market. Alma Regions has expanded its operations beyond its natural geographic area. The unit hired five regional sales managers in different parts of Finland to sell the Alma network and, in particular, regionally targeted advertising. There is natural demand for paid content, i.e. content marketing, and Alma Regions has responded to this demand by investing resources in the sales and production

of content marketing in Satakunta, Pirkanmaa and Lapland.
Print advertising continued to decline, but the segment's own digital revenue, the Alma M edia network's sales and content marketing revenue helped partly compensate for the decrease in print advertising sales.
Alma Regions' in-house product development completed the Tekes-funded Reviiri project during the year. The aim of the project was to study and implement a new kind of media platform. Among other things, Alma Regions experimented with geolocation-based content services. The groundwork laid down by the project will be built on further with the support of Google's Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund, which granted funding of EUR 300,000 to Alma Regions for the development of smart notifications for mobile services. Smart notifications make it possible to build an even more customised and meaningful user experience. They can be used to offer consumers targeted content according to their areas of interest, geographic location and time, among other things. Product development efforts in 2018 will include a

comprehensive technological renewal of all of the unit's digital services.
Alma Manu's printing press increased its external revenue thanks to new customers. The printing press had a very high prime time capacity utilisation rate in 2017. The printing press has used product development to reach out to a broader customer base than before.
Alma Manu's distribution business is profitable and Jakeluyhtiö Suomi has provided additional revenue. Alma Manu's delivery staff also deliver letters and magazines along with the morning papers.
Alma Regions implemented profitability improvement measures in the publishing business in all regions. The largest change took place in Lapland, where the Pohjolan Sanomat brand was discontinued entirely. Following this change, Lapin Kansa is the only regional newspaper published in the Lapland region. In Satakunta and Pirkanmaa, operations were enhanced and centralised. Some services were outsourced. As a result of these measures, the number of employees was reduced by 35 person-years.

The goal of Alma Regions is paid content across all channels. Content subscriptions are full subscriptions that include both print and digital.
The focus of human resource development remained on improving leadership and management as well as boosting and diversifying the competencies required by the digital transformation.
Aamulehti's overall design was recognised as the best in the Nordic region in the annual newspaper design competition organised by the Society for News Design Scandinavia (SNDS). The award is one of the most renowned of its kind in the world and Aamulehti was the first- ever Finnish winner. Aamulehti also won four silver medals and one bronze medal in the Nordic competition. A amulehti's visual design also received four honourable mentions in the international European Newspaper Award competition.

Responsible Alma Media
Alma Media takes a broad view of responsibility. It encompasses not only Alma Media's responsibility for the social, economic and ecological impacts of its operations, but also the responsibility media companies bear for the impact on society of the media content they publish.

In 2016, Alma M edia defined its purpose as accelerating the sustainable growth of individuals, companies and society. This means that responsibility is an integral part of Alma Media's business and serves as a guideline for the development of all operations. A commercial media company must also bear social and ecological responsibility for its operations.
In addition to the purpose statement, Alma M edia's operations as a responsible media company are guided by the megatrends influencing society, including the risks and opportunities they involve as well as Alma Media's values and responsibility programme.
The responsibility programme represents the Group's effort to find ways to exercise influence at the regional and national levels to address the challenges that have become significant global issues related to sustainable development. The drafting of the responsibility programme was also guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals published in 2015 and the Finnish action

plan based on them. The selected focus areas of Alma Media's responsibility programme are the aspects of sustainable development that Alma M edia can best contribute to through its operations. They are: health and well-being (UN Sustainable Development Goal 3), quality education (Goal 4), decent work and economic growth (Goal 8), and peace and justice (Goal 16, related to the media's role as a social institution).
These four goals are closely linked to the four themes defined as the key aspects of Alma Media's corporate responsibility: Social responsibility, Responsible products and services, Responsible business and Responsible employer. As a company, Alma Media is a significant source of economic activity and vitality both directly, by employing more than 2,200 full-time employees, and indirectly, by purchasing products and services. As a media company, Alma Media is an important cornerstone of a pluralistic, democratic and equal society. It promotes citizens' opportunities to participate in social dialogue by providing high-quality, relevant and

unbiased information on current topics. Through its digital services, Alma Media supports the sustainable growth of other companies' operations and provides

individuals with tools for increasing their personal knowledge and competencies as well as solutions related to housing and careers.

Corporate responsibility in Alma Media has been divided into four themes: Social r esponsibility, Responsible products and services, Responsible business and Responsibility as an employer.
The themes have been presented in the materiality chart on the following page which illustrates how the different aspects of Alma Media's corporate responsibility are related to the themes.

"Alma Media's purpose is to accelerate the sustainable growth of companies, individuals, and society. Responsibility is an unseparable part of everything we do."
Kai Telanne, CEO, Alma Media

Alma Media's four themes are also linked with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, especially these:

Alma Media conducted a materiality analysis in 2016 to determine which areas of corporate responsibility are most material to the Group. In addition to the Group's own employees, the participants in the materiality assessment included other Alma Media stakeholders. Their views were surveyed by means of a questionnaire. The survey was completed by more than six thousand representatives of employees, private and corporate customers, investors and other stakeholders. As a result of the analysis, Alma M edia defined its new corporate responsibility priorities. The work then continued in 2017 when Alma M edia set objectives for each aspect of corporate responsibility.

Responsible journalism
Alma Media's editorial offices are committed to full compliance with the law and industry self-regulation.

Social responsibility

Responsible media companies in Finland operate within the limits set by the Guidelines for Journalists as well as the legislation that governs freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the operations of the media. The Guidelines for Journalists are drafted by the Council for Mass Media, which is the media sector's self-regulatory organisation. In many respects, the guidelines impose stricter standards on media outlets than what the law requires. The goal of regulation is to establish consistent practices for responsible journalism. Among other things, the Guidelines for Journalists cover responsible citation practices, interviewees' rights, publishing corrections to inaccurate information and the need to distinguish between advertisements and journalistic content.
To ensure the transparency and ethicality of their operations, responsible Finnish media companies have also granted the Council for Mass Media the authority to monitor their operations. Led by its chairman, the Council for Mass Media meets 10­11 times per year to handle complaints reported regarding the actions of Finnish

media outlets. If the Council finds that a media outlet has violated good journalistic practice, it issues a reprimand. A severe reprimand is issued for gross violations. The Council's decisions are important, as they often serve as precedents in the media sector. In doing so, they shape editorial practices in the field of content production, which is changing rapidly due to the digital transformation.
Alma M edia's editorial offices monitor the Council's decisions closely and perceive them as one way to develop the responsibility of operations. Other inputs used by Editors-in-Chiefs and other senior members of editorial teams in the development of journalistic practices include reader feedback on previous stories and the results of reader surveys. They also monitor the public discussion surrounding media and the way it operates. The content meetings of editorial teams, which Alma M edia's editorial offices hold as part of planning their day-to-day work, always include a review of feedback. In many editorial offices, the internal feedback practices also include managers regularly sending

written feedback to their subordinates regarding the day-to-day work of the editorial office and arranging workshops for their subordinates. Alma M edia's editorial offices also have their own style books that provide a comprehensive description of policies related to the media brand and responsible journalism. The editorial offices also have separate guidelines related to, for example, fact checking and the use of social media.
Responsible media fights for highquality journalism In addition to the responsibility efforts related to day-to-day journalism, Alma M edia's media outlets are always looking for ways to develop responsible journalism through joint projects. As one of their first shared steps in the fight against fake news, Alma M edia's editorial teams set two goals in 2017 aimed at supporting the development of responsible journalistic practices at Alma M edia's editorial offices.
The first goal was that Alma M edia's editorial offices' combined share of the condemnatory decisions issued by the Council for Mass Media should not exceed 20 per cent of the total condemnatory decisions issued in any given year. This target can be adjusted if the combined total weekly reach of Alma M edia's media outlets changes significantly from the current level of approximately 74 per cent (Finns aged 15­74).
The second goal set by Alma M edia's major media outlets involves setting

their own targets for the quality and reliability of content by the year 2019 and monitoring their progress by means of regular reader surveys. One of the key development projects in the area of responsible journalism in Alma M edia's editorial offices in 2018 will be to implement regular reader surveys at those of the Group's major media outlets that are not yet using them. In conjunction with this, the lessons learned from the surveys used to assess readers' impressions that were implemented by Iltalehti and Alma M edia's regional media in 2017 will be reviewed to determine how the measurements and their use can be developed further.
Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 In addition to the project related to surveys aimed at assessing readers' impressions, Alma M edia's media outlets have decided to launch a joint action programme in 2018 to find ways to minimise errors, which inevitably happen in journalistic work on occasion, and harmonise error correction practices between different editorial offices. The action programme will coincide with an extensive internal training project aimed at providing journalists with tools for producing even more high-quality content for various channels.
In order to strengthen the trust of readers and other stakeholders in media as an institution, Alma M edia's editorial offices aim to become more active in presenting their editorial processes to audiences

To create a strong editorial culture, the management of the editorial team must actively supervise and guide team members in their work, give feedback as part of day-to-day work and review existing practices based on emergent development needs. In 2017:
· Lapin Kansa, Satakunnan Kansa, Aamulehti and Iltalehti began conducting regular reader surveys to monitor reader perceptions regarding their reliability and credibility.
· Aamulehti updated its internal guidelines regarding journalists' ties and connections.

"The Editor-in-Chief and his or her subordinate news editors are responsible for creating a strong editorial culture and ensuring that all members of the editorial team understand their professional responsibilities and act accordingly."
Arno Ahosniemi, Senior Editor-in-Chief, Alma Talent

· Iltalehti launched a project to establish a reliable commenting platform. The existing content commenting systems of many media outlets are based on social media networks that have been unable to take effective action against the abuse of their platforms. Iltalehti also started a quality project focused on the accuracy of headlines.

· Alma Media's financial media held a large joint seminar in October to refine editorial practices by discussing example stories. External experts were also on hand at the seminar to share their views.

· Alma Media's major media outlets established a fixed-term fact checking team at the end of the year. The team's purpose was to check the truthfulness of claims made by candidates in the Finnish presidential election. In the future, the method will be used in other occasions.

outside the industry as well. In a threeyear project starting in 2018, volunteers from the Alma M edia organisation will visit schools to talk about the practices followed at Alma M edia's editorial offices and highlight the differences between news and fake news (see page 43 for more information). Alma M edia's editorial offices are also experimenting with different ways of sharing information on their journalistic process. One example of this is the way that Alma M edia's fact checking team, established in late 2017, complements the stories it publishes with a detailed explanation of the journalistic process by which the fact team's stories are created. Further initiatives of this nature will be tested in 2018, and Aamulehti has already decided that the editorial team will begin to shed light on the journalistic process behind significant stories published in the Aamulehti online service. The newspaper will establish this new practice in 2018.

Alma M edia's media outlets did not achieve their goal related to condemnatory decisions issued by the Council for Mass Media in the first year of having the target in place. Their combined share of all condemnatory d ecisions issued by the Council for Mass Media in 2017 was 32 per cent. In total, the Council issued 28 condemnatory decisions in 2017, with nine of these decisions concerning Alma M edia's media outlets.
The majority of the condemnatory decisions against Alma M edia's media outlets involved surreptitious a dvertising. The number of condemnatory decisions issued by the Council for Mass Media regarding surreptitious advertising has increased across the entire industry in recent years due to the constant development of the rapidly growing field of content marketing. Condemnatory decisions have been received because the editorial offices' operating methods related to content marketing have not been fully established and the publishing t echnology available to the editorial offices has not always enabled sufficiently careful labelling of advertisements.
In addition, Alma Media's media outlets received several condemnatory decisions from the Council in 2017 regarding the incorrect communication of information due to reasons such as not being sufficiently critical of sources or failing to carry out adequate fact checking.

The traditional media must be able to provide a strong opposing force to content confusion and disinformation. Fake news have been shown to increase social frustration and the sense of exclusion among people who follow them, as well as influence people's voting behaviour in elections.

The task of Alma M edia's media outlets is to build sustainable social development as well as to defend freedom of speech and democracy.
As a commercial media company, Alma M edia's business model is based on the trust that readers, advertisers and other stakeholders have in its contents. If this trust were to crumble, so would the Group's business.

Social influence
A responsible modern company must create added value for society and be an active member of its community.

Social responsibility

Alma Media puts social responsibility into practice each year by organising local, regional and national campaigns, projects and events that promote regional vitality, economic activity and community spirit.
Alma M edia's regional media brands, for example, support local junior sports and culture. They also participate in the activities of regional entrepreneur networks. They organise discussion events that bring businesses, citizens and various societal operators together and promote awareness and influence related to issues of regional and social significance. The Alma M edia units that produce digital services in Eastern Central Europe have ongoing social projects aimed at preventing economic and social marginalisation. Kauppalehti promotes entrepreneurship, business growth, employment and increased appreciation for businesses. It addresses the preconditions and success factors behind growth-oriented entrepreneurship in many ways; for example, by organising the annual Kasvajat tour ("Growth Company tour") and Menestyjät project

("Achiever project"). Alma M edia's Finnish financial media brands, K auppalehti and Talouselämä, also promote female business leadership in Finland through the annual Päättäjänaiset project and by creating networking opportunities for female business leaders.
In addition to social projects, Alma Media's media brands engage in ongoing media literacy work by, among other things, participating in Newspaper Week campaigns, inviting school groups to visit editorial offices and sending journalists to schools to talk about their work. Aamulehti is an active partner in the national Me & MyCity initiative, which gives sixth-graders in the region the opportunity to learn about the work that takes place at Aamulehti's editorial office when they visit the Pirkanmaa Me & MyCity learning environment.
Targets set for social influence Alma Media set corporate responsibility targets for its social activities in 2017. The first target is that, starting from 2018, Alma Media must carry out at least one national-level social project

or media education project in Finland each year.
The national-level social projects and media education projects are managed by Alma Media's Corporate Communications unit. The second target is directly related to the Corporate Communications function. It states that Corporate Communications will use at least 300 man-hours annually on the planning and coordination of social projects and media literacy projects. The third target, which is related to Alma Media's media education efforts, is that Alma Media employees will go on at least 150 school visits in Finland in 2018­2020.
The shared targets serve as a foundation for cooperation between Alma Media's units aimed at increasing the impact of social projects and media literacy projects. The goal is that Alma Media's units will use their resources in a more targeted manner in accordance with the themes of the corporate responsibility programme and share best practices between themselves.
Focus areas in the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 In 2018, Alma M edia aims to improve the impact and visibility of its social projects and media literacy projects. Achieving this goal calls for even closer cooperation between Alma M edia's units, increasing internal and external communication and engaging Alma M edia's key social partners in responsibility-related cooperation.

The piloting of new operating methods began in February 2018 with a three-year school visit project launched in Finland. The aim of the project is to encourage as many Alma M edia employees as possible to go on school visits to discuss the role of responsible media in society and educate young people on the difference between real news and fake news. The employees of Alma M edia's editorial offices going on school visits is nothing new, but this project marks the first time that common Alma-level materials have been prepared for them to use on their visits.
The school visit project is implemented in close cooperation with Alma M edia's long-term partner, the Finnish Children and Youth Foundation (FCYF). FCYF's expertise and school contacts to upper comprehensive schools and Valma classes geared towards preparatory vocational education will benefit the project. FCYF also provides orientation training to Alma M edia employees before they go on visits to Valma classes and assists them in preparing the materials for the visits.
In 2018, Alma M edia will also cooperate with the Cancer Foundation. The cooperation project being implemented in the year that marks the Foundation's 70th anniversary aims to promote research and development related to cancer prevention and treatment.
Alma Media's regional media and Iltalehti will also participate in the project by publishing content related to the subject in 2018.

Social influence ­ Highlights in 2017 · Media education: Aamulehti, Satakunnan Kansa, Iltalehti and Lapin Kansa
provided more than 150,000 newspapers free of charge to schools for use in teaching during the year. · Supporting NGOs: Direct donations to NGO activities in Finland totalled approximately EUR 54,000 in Finland and about EUR 35,000 in the Czech Republic. The LMC recruitment service in the Czech Republic supported NGOs by providing them access to recruitment services for a nominal fee of one euro. The computational value of this initiative was approximately EUR 4.1 million in 2017, with more than 4,000 permanent jobs filled. · Preventing marginalisation: Alma M edia's recruitment services in Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Croatia, Latvia and the Czech Republic provided job seeking advice free of charge to selected target groups (such as young people and the unemployed). · Stakeholder engagement: Alma M edia and the Finnish Children and Youth Foundation conducted a joint campaign on hate speech, fake media and a ntagonism, which culminated in a discussion held at the SuomiAreena event in Pori in July 2017. Lapin Kansa continued the Digimpi Lappi ("A More Digital Lapland"), launched in 2016, with regional partners.

Information security and data protection

As the collection and utilisation of data becomes an increasingly pivotal aspect of companies' business operations, issues related to privacy protection and the responsible processing of information take on a more and more important role.

Alma M edia also collects data from various sources with the aim of delivering better targeted digital content and services to consumers and reliable first-party and second-party data to advertisers, for example. To ensure security, the company continuously invests in the development of systems, services and employee competence and, in 2017, the company set targets related to the responsible development of information security and data protection.
The first target is that Alma M edia should have no serious information security breaches during any reporting period (one year) and should receive no reprimands from the authorities regarding breaches of information security or data protection. In 2017, the company achieved this target.

twice a year, starting from 2018, and organising corresponding training for new employees four times per year. The goal of the training is to continuously improve the data protection competencies of employees.
The first training events aimed at all employees were organised in 2017. They covered the data processing and data management obligations that Alma M edia will be subject to following the entry into force of the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in 2018.
In addition to training employees, Alma Media prepared for the GDPR by, among other things, updating its contract terms for advertisers, updating the data file descriptions of digital services and appointing a Data Protection Officer.

According to the second responsibility target related to information security and data protection, Alma Media is committed to organising data protection training for all employees in Finland

An extensive data protection review was conducted on all of Alma Media's services in the summer. Based on the review, Alma Media will conduct more detailed data protection impact assessments for

The GDPR, which will enter into force in 2018, also requires Alma M edia to take the technical measures necessary to prepare for the new responsibilities. During the reporting period, the Group implemented new technical solutions for the management of data protection and launched a user access management project. Preparations also began for a project to develop the detection of information security threats and responding to them. The project will be implemented in 2018.
Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 In 2018, Alma Media will continue to prepare for the responsibilities brought about by the EU GDPR by developing internal processes and technical systems, training employees, updating the data file descriptions of the Group's services and updating contract terms. In addition to enhancing information security, Alma Media will implement

new data protection management tools. Employee training will be expanded in the first half of the year to include Alma Media's foreign units, while in Finland, in-depth workshops will be organised for selected employee groups in whose work data processing and management play a significant role.
These measures will ensure the regulatory compliance of customer data processing in Alma M edia's services when the GDPR enters into force. They also help the Group take precautions against evolving information security threats and make it easier to prepare for potential new regulations. One example of such potential developments is the EU's ongoing effort to supplement the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications with a new ePrivacy Regulation that will govern electronic marketing and advertising. The Regulation will cover topics such as the processing of behavioural data and location data collected by cookies and similar technologies.

In order to respond to the challenges presented by the digitalisation of marketing, Alma Media has systematically enhanced the digital competencies of its media sales and marketing organisation in recent years and developed its advertising systems. The aim of these investments is to ensure that Alma Media will maintain its position as a competent and high-quality digital marketing partner and a competitive media advertising network, as well as provide advertisers and consumer customers with a safe and productive advertising environment.
Alma M edia's most significant marketing development investments in 2017 were allocated to advertising and data management technology.

At the same time, a new project was started to replace the customer data management platform. The new platform will offer better and more reliable targeting for advertising while

ensuring that Alma Media will process the customer data collected via the advertisements displayed on its websites in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR will enter into effect in EU member states in May 2018.
During the year under review, Alma M edia also prepared for the implementation of the GDPR by organising related training events for employees and advertisers as well as by starting to revise the contract terms applied in advertising sales. Alma Media's new contract terms require all advertising buyers and their representatives, such as media agencies, to commit to using data in compliance with the GDPR.
Alma Media's media sales function established responsible marketing targets for itself at the end of the year. The first target is that Alma Media's online and mobile services should not feature any (zero) advertisements that violate the I nternational Chamber of Commerce's Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice. This target was achieved in 2017, and Alma Media was not the subject of any reprimands by the authorities that monitor the legality and responsibility of advertising, either.
The second target is that, by 2020, Alma M edia's media sales organisation in Finland will be ranked among the leaders of its industry (index average) in the annual national survey of the

customer experience of media sales organisations. The monitoring of this target will begin in 2018.
Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 Responsible marketing at Alma Media includes the publisher's responsibility as a sales organisation and as a provider of advertising environments, as well as the responsibility related to the Group's own marketing activities.
As a major national media company, Alma Media can play an important role in promoting responsible marketing practices in the Finnish marketing communications industry. To this end, Alma Media's media sales organisation regularly arranges events for media agencies and advertisers to highlight responsible marketing themes and increase know-how related to new digital advertising environments. Alma Media is also actively involved in industry advocacy organisations and works to increase the expertise of marketing communications agencies by participating in the Agency of the Year competition as an organiser and media partner.
One of the key themes of responsible marketing that Alma Media aims to highlight in these forums in 2018 is the digital advertising purchasing path.

Particularly in programmatic buying, the pricing of advertising may be difficult to understand because the advertising campaign's price and invoicing chain consists of different payments to the parties controlling the various technology platforms required for the programmatic buying of advertising.
Alma Media will also allocate substantial media sales resources in the first half of the year to preparations for the entry into force of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. A new data management platform will be deployed in the first half of the year. Alma Media's media sales will also continue its project to prepare partnership agreements with media agencies relating to the

responsible use of data. During the spring, supplementary training on the GDPR will be organised for Alma Media's media sales representatives to review the new requirements related to data processing and marketing. In 2018, Alma Media will also participate in a Finnmedia-coordinated project aimed at ensuring GDPR compliance among companies operating in the field of marketing communications in Finland.
In addition to GDPR-related activities, Alma Media will also keep a close eye on changes in the operating environment of digital advertising with the aim of anticipating the spread to Finland of new forms of malicious advertising, for example.

Responsible business

The cornerstones of sustainable business at Alma M edia are the Group's Code of Conduct and corporate responsibility programme. They state that the Group respects human rights and rejects bribery, corruption and discrimination ­ and expects the same from its business partners. Continuing on this policy, Alma Media set a goal in 2017 of having zero tolerance for violations related to corruption, bribery and other unethical business practices. The achievement of this goal is measured by monitoring whether the Group is informed of any incidents of unethical business practices by the authorities or via the anonymous whistleblowing channel made available to employees. In 2017 no such incidents came forward, so the goal was achieved.
Another important aspect of Alma Media's sustainable business is striving for transparency and trustwor-

Alma Media's media brands are politically independent and they do not receive press subsidies from the state. · Alma Media does not support political parties or individuals in any way. Alma Media advocates for the interests of commercial media companies mainly by participating in the activities of a few key advocacy organisations. The most important of these are the Confederation of Finnish Industries, the Central Chamber of Commerce, the Finnish Newspapers Association and Finnmedia. · Alma Media may apply discounts to election campaign advertising, but such discounts are offered to all can-

didates and parties under the same terms. · Some of Alma M edia's media brands also apply discounts to advertising sales when the buyer is a non-profit organisation, and the rest of the media brands will adopt this practice during 2018.
In order to further increase the transparency of its business, Alma Media began to systematically develop its tax footprint reporting in 2017. In conjunction with developing its tax footprint reporting Alma Media also updated its tax policy. The principle underpinning the tax policy is that Alma Media operates openly and transparently with respect to taxation and pays taxes in the country where the result is generated. In its operations, Alma M edia complies with the valid legislation, regulations and international transfer pricing guidelines and, where necessary, seeks clarification from the tax authorities or tax experts.

Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 To ensure the employees' familiarity with Alma Media's Code of Conduct, the Group prepared the roll-out of digital induction training materials related to the Code of Conduct in late 2017. All newly recruited employees will be required to complete the module as part of their induction training. The Group aims to roll out the induction training materials in all of its units in 2018.
Additionally, Alma Media also further develops its tax footprint reporting by specifying the reportable information in greater detail.

Alma M edia's media brands and services are among the largest players in their respective industries in many countries. Their operations create and maintain economic activity through the payment of taxes and wages as well as the procurement of products and services from local businesses. In 2017, Alma Media's direct purchases of goods and services alone amounted to MEUR 155.
In addition to the purchases from suppliers and service providers, Alma Media's largest expenses in 2017 consisted of wages and other remunerations MEUR 149, dividends paid to shareholders as well as taxes and investments. The majority of the income comprised of sales revenue from corporate and individual customers.

The chart does not include contributions and donations received from foundations or other private or public entities, as they represent a small proportion of Alma M edia's income streams. Alma M edia's most significant source of financial support in 2017 was Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Alma M edia received EUR 384,000 from Tekes as the final instalment of a grant issued in the previous year to a development project that investigated the potential for building a new media platform for use by local media. In addition, as in the previous year, Alma M edia's Lapin Kansa received a grant of EUR 40,000 from the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture to cover the costs of Sami-language news production.

Responsibility throughout the supply chain
It is typical of the media industry that subcontractors range from global corporations to solopreneurs. This presents challenges to Alma M edia's procurement policy.

In 2017, Alma M edia had active supplier relationships with about 4,000 suppliers and service providers in Finland alone. Of these, 31 were major suppliers defined by Alma M edia as key subcontracting partners. The other extreme in Alma M edia's subcontractor palette is represented by small content production companies and freelance photographers, videographers and journalists that provide various content to the Group's media. They numbered approximately 1,100 in 2017.
With the size of subcontractors varying from global corporations that are among the largest players in their respective industries to microbusinesses with a sole proprietor, managing supplier relationships requires Alma M edia to understand the diversity of the supply chain and field of procurement. To this end, Alma M edia's Finnish units have adopted a two-tier procurement model. Purchases are made both at the local level and on a centralised basis to ensure that procurement is smooth, economical and sustainable. For example, the procurement of content services by local and regional editorial teams is not centralised, because purchasing

high-quality and locally relevant content requires local insight and contacts from both the orderer and the content producer. With many other types of purchases, on the other hand, it makes sense to manage them on a centralised basis.
To manage the risks related to subcontracting relationships from the perspective of sustainability, Alma Media's country units make most of their purchases domestically or from nearby regions where businesses are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation. In addition to legislation, Alma Media's subcontracting is guided by the Group's Code of Conduct, which requires that the Group's employees and subcontractors act ethically, responsibly and with respect for the law. The Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits corruption, bribery and discrimination. Subcontractors in Finland are also reminded of these obligations in the subcontracting agreement, which was supplemented in 2017 with a summary of the goals and focus areas of Alma Media's responsibility programme.

Responsible business
In 2017, all of the paper pulp used at Alma M edia's printing facility was certified in accordance with international forest management certification systems. The certificates guarantee that the raw materials used to produce the paper pulp were sourced from forests that are managed in a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable manner. More than 90 per cent of the paper pulp was purchased from either Finnish or Swedish suppliers whose wood sourcing chain is documented.

Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 Alma M edia aims to engage its subcontractors in active dialogue on responsibility. Starting from 2018, this dialogue will be even more systematically fostered with suppliers and service providers defined as the Group's key suppliers. Alma M edia will start a project to encourage all key subcontractors to establish their own long-term climate targets by 2025.
The key subcontractors represent those three of Alma Media's procure-

ment categories that generate the highest CO2 emissions: ICT, printing press materials and transport. The project is related to Alma Media's decision to establish long-term science-based targets in accordance with an internationally approved methodology and in line with the emissions targets outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement.
At the same time, Alma Media will aim to improve and develop the monitoring and calculation of the CO2 emissions associated with its purchases. The main

challenge in this area is estimating the environmental impacts of ICT purchases. As digital media consumption increases, there is a growing need to determine the environmental impacts of Alma Media's ICT purchases. However, calculating and allocating these impacts is difficult for several reasons, such as the extensive use of ICT services via global cloud service providers.

Environmental impacts of operations
Alma M edia applies the materiality principle in the development of its environmental responsibility. With this in mind, the Group focuses on minimising the environmental impacts of its printing and distribution operations, properties and procurement.

Responsible business

The focus areas were selected in 2017 based on a comprehensive emissions analysis conducted that same year. The analysis indicated that printing and distribution operations, procurement and the electricity, district heating and district cooling consumption of properties account for approximately twothirds of the carbon dioxide emissions created by Alma Media's operations.
In 2017, Alma Media set four long-term environmental targets with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of Alma Media's properties, commuter transport and procurement as well as printing and distribution operations. For properties and commuting, Alma Media set a target of reducing the CO2 emissions of Alma Media's leased cars and the CO2 emissions caused by the electricity, district heating and district cooling of its properties. The reduction target for the properties and commuting is 21 per cent by 2025, using 2016 as the baseline.

In Finland, a further goal is to improve the energy efficiency of properties by five per cent in 2016­2020 and to discontinue the use of non-renewable electric power by 2020. For several years

now, Alma M edia's printing press has engaged in systematic and successful efforts to minimise the environmental impacts of printing operations. The new environmental target for the Group's printing operations is that the material waste associated with printing operations will be reduced by two per cent per year in 2016­2025.
Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 The impacts of climate change on business operations are an integral aspect of environmental responsibility among today's companies.
Recognising this, Alma Media has assessed the effects of climate change on its business. However, based on Alma M edia's assessment, regulatory risks outweigh the direct business risks of climate change in the medium term. It is possible that international environ-

mental pressure on the business sector will increase, and that companies will be subject to new regulatory requirements to reduce their emissions.
Alma Media takes a proactive approach towards this scenario. In 2017, the Group became one of the first Finnish companies to establish long-term, science-based climate targets in line with the methodology outlined by SBTi, the international Science-Based Target initiative. SBTi will assess Alma Media's targets in 2018. Following the approval of the targets, Alma Media has committed to reducing its CO2 emissions in accordance with the international emissions reduction targets specified in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. As part of its commitment, Alma Media will also start a long-term project in 2018 to encourage all its key subcontractors in Finland to establish their own long-term climate targets.

Environmental responsibility in Alma Media's printing press links seamlessly with developing production processes and quality and having an effective procurement policy.
Subcontractor relationships are based on Alma Manu's procurement guidelines, which include quality standards for the key materials used by the printing press.

"Quality and material efficiency go hand in hand. If the rate of material waste is high, quality will not be optimal either."
Jussi Pekkarinen, Quality Manager, Alma Media's printing press Alma Manu

The printing press develops its production processes by conducting training to complement employee competencies and carrying out materials testing, among other things.

Completed in 2013, the printing press also has modern equipment and appropriate facilities where production processes are designed to be efficient and environmentally friendly.

Why is reducing emissions important to society?
The acceleration of climate change will lead to increased extreme weather phenomena and climate-induced migration. It will create political instability in the most highly affected areas.

Equal and diverse work community
As an employer, Alma Media is committed to treating its employees equally and fairly.

To ensure the equal treatment of employees, Alma M edia's units in Finland draft non-discrimination, equality and diversity plans at two-year intervals. In preparing these plans, they utilise information such as employee wage analyses and the results of Alma M edia's employee survey. The content of the plans varies by unit, but their common features include investigating employee concerns highlighted in audits, such as the reasons for differences in wages and the use of fixed-term employment contracts, as well as assessing the gender breakdown of different roles.
The completed plans constitute the practical guidelines for the diversity and equality efforts that Alma M edia has committed to by signing the FIBS Diversity Undertaking in 2015. The FIBS undertaking obligates Alma M edia to provide equal opportunities for employees, identify and utilise individual competencies and manage its employees in a fair manner.

Alma M edia monitors the realisation of a diverse employee policy against the targets set for responsibility for employees in 2017. Three of the targets measure Alma M edia's progress in both of the aspects of responsibility for employees deemed material by the Group: the development of an equal and diverse work community and improving the competence and well-being of employees. According to the targets:
· Alma Media's QWL (Quality of Work Life) index must be at least 70 per cent each year. The index is based on the employee survey, which measures factors related to the quality of work life in various companies.
This target was achieved in 2017. Alma Media's QWL index was 76 per cent.
· Alma Media should receive an average score of at least 7 from its employees in the annual employer image survey.

Alma M edia exceeded this target in 2017. The average score awarded by Alma M edia employees was 7.98 on a scale of 1­10.
· Alma Media should be able to retain its new employees. The target is that at least 10% of new full-time employees on permanent contracts stay with the company for at least two years after being hired.
In 2017 the goal was not achieved. The departure turnover amongst full-time employees (permanent contracts) who had begun working for Alma Media no more than two years ago was 12.9 per cent.
Of the other two targets related to responsibility for employees, one is more clearly related to the development of an equal and diverse work community. According to that target, Alma M edia must not have any incidents of employee discrimination or other inappropriate treatment. The achievement of this target is assessed by monitoring whether the Group is informed during the reporting year of any violations related to the inappropriate treatment of employees, either by the authorities or via the whistleblowing channel available to the Group's employees. In 2017, there were no incidents.
Focus areas for the development corporate responsibility in 2018 To build the media of the future, Alma M edia needs its employees to be as diverse as possible. The rapid digital

transformation of the media sector means that managing and processing data is becoming an increasingly significant aspect of Alma M edia's day-to-day business. At the same time, information security and data protection issues have taken on more importance, and the focus of advertising and news content has shifted from print to online and mobile. Consequently, today's journalists and media sales employees need to have extensive digital and social media skills.
To maintain its capacity for continued strong business performance, Alma M edia must be able to attract talented professionals in industries characterised by intense competition for employees. As in the previous year, one of the key focus areas of Alma M edia's HR activities in 2018 will be to develop leadership and management systematically and with a long-term approach. Another important focus area is to clarify Alma M edia's employer image and communicate the employer image more effectively to the key audience of talented professionals. In 2017, the Group placed special focus on the recruitment of digital developers, which is an area where Alma M edia's units have faced occasional challenges. The measures taken in this area included the use of recruitment videos and social media channels, and a trainee programme aimed at digital developers also produced good results.
Similar approaches will be utilised again in 2018. Alma Media must also be able to provide a modern and competitive work

Developing competence and well-being
The digital transformation of the media sector means that the core competencies of employees can quickly become outdated when new tools are introduced and requirements change.

Responsibility as an employer

For several years now, Alma M edia's response to this challenge has been to emphasise learning on the job and the continuous development of competence. Learning on the job creates the opportunity to quickly respond to new competence needs arising from technological progress, for example. Larger training programmes implemented in cooperation with external training providers may not achieve the same result, as the planning of training takes time. For the same reason, Alma M edia developed a new agile training model in the mid-2010s to complement the Group's existing methods of developing the employees' core competencies. The model has subsequently become an established practice in all of Alma M edia's Finnish units. The advantages of the model are that it is fast, needs-based and cost-efficient. The training is customised to meet the units' specific competence needs. The units' supervisors and the participating employees themselves decide on the training content to ensure that it corresponds closely to the identified needs.

In addition to the rapid response training targeted at specific needs, Alma Media also carried out an extensive training project called FutureMe in autumn 2017. Open to all Alma Media employees in Finland, the project was implemented in cooperation with an external training provider. The aim of the training was to improve the participating employees' understanding of their own strengths and competence development needs in the context of working life that is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. Starting from 2018, the lessons learned from the FutureMe project will be applied in the career guidance and training of other Alma Media employees as well.
In addition to competence development alongside their normal duties, Alma Media's employees also supplement their skills and expertise regularly in various short seminars and training events organised by external parties. In addition, some Alma Media employees voluntarily pursue longer-

term training. The opportunity to take study leave was utilised by 72 employees across Alma Media's various units in Finland in 2017. As in previous years, Alma Media again supported its employees financially in these cases. The extent and form of the support was determined on a case-by-case basis. The evaluation was based on whether the training was considered to improve the employee's competencies and abilities in his or her work at Alma Media.

Developing occupational health and reducing accidents The majority of Alma Media's occupational accidents and commuting accidents occur in newspaper delivery operations. While serious occupational accidents are very rare, accidents such as slipping and stumbling are commonplace among delivery staff.
Occupational safety has been highlighted as a key focus area in Alma Media's distribution operations. In 2017, the Group set a target for the distribution unit to reduce occupational accidents by half in five years, using 2017 as the benchmark.
This target can only be achieved through systematic efforts to improve occupational safety among delivery staff and prevent occupational accidents. One aspect of these efforts involves ensuring that delivery staff have appropriate, ergonomic and safe equipment. All of Alma M edia's permanent delivery staff now have uniforms that feature reflective materials. Delivery staff are also offered optional traction cleats for their shoes and bicycle helmets are provided for delivery staff who use a bicycle to do their rounds. They also have access to tools that make delivery work faster and more ergonomic.
Another aspect of the reduction of occupational accidents is developing the induction training for delivery staff.

Lost days (days)

In 2017, Alma M edia's various Finnish units recorded a total of 20,378 days of sick leave. Delivery staff accounted for 57 per cent of this total (11,598 days).
The number of occupational accidents and commuting accidents was also significantly higher for delivery staff than other Alma M edia employees in 2017. Of the 142 (2016: 171) occupational accidents and commuting accidents recorded by Alma M edia in 2017, 104 occurred in delivery operations.

The emphasis of the current induction training model used by Alma Media's distribution company is on digital self-study. Before starting work, the delivery staff must complete an induction training course that includes occupational safety as one key theme. All of Alma Media's delivery staff also have a PDA device that they can use to report occupational safety risks and near misses to their supervisors during their rounds. All new delivery staff also go on rounds with a more experienced colleague as part of their induction training.

In addition to the measures already implemented to improve occupational safety, Alma Media's delivery staff will receive safety training in 2018 to support the achievement of the targeted reduction in occupational accidents. Accident prevention efforts will be enhanced by analysing near misses and accidents involving delivery staff in even more detail than before. The distribution company's occupational safety and health organisation will also be engaged in the process of drafting and implementing the action plan.

Responsibility for employees ­ Highlights in 2017
· Alma M edia's score in the QWL employee survey improved by 10 points in one year to reach 76, which corresponds to the level achieved by the best companies in Finland.
· Alma M edia's attractiveness as an employer improved substantially in a national employer image survey among both professionals and students.

* Large proportion of deliverers among employees explains the high share of part-timers in Finland.

In 2017, in all Alma Media's operating countries at least 85 per cent of the Group's employees had a permanent contract. Majority of the Group's employees were also employed full-time, the only exception being Finland, where a large propotion of the personnel is part-time deliverers.
Alma M edia's distribution unit started a project in 2017 to create long-term commitment among delivery staff along with increased appreciation for delivery work. The project was launched in autumn 2017, and it looks to change the way delivery work is perceived and enhance recruitment practices, among other things. The aim of the project is to ensure the availability of employees and improve Alma Manu Oy's employer image.

In addition to the large number of part-time employees, Alma M edia's employee profile in Finland is different from the other operating countries in that Alma M edia's editorial offices regularly use freelancers in content production. These relationships are often long-term collaborations. For example, the foreign correspondent roles of many of Alma M edia's editorial offices are based on these types of arrangements. Alma M edia's editorial offices manage their relationships with these networks of freelancers independently, placing orders for stories, video clips or photos to supplement the editorial office's own content production as needed.

The sustained economic growth in many Central and Eastern European countries presents recruitment-related challenges to firms, including Alma M edia's businesses. There is an intense competition for skilled professionals and high mobility of employees in the job market. The Czech-based recruitment company LMC, for example, has made efforts to increase the commitment of its professionals by providing plentiful training opportunities both in the Czech Republic and abroad and by giving employees and teams a lot of freedom to lead themselves.
In Finland, the continued transformation of the media sector and advertising markets has created cost reduction pressures on media companies. Many of them, including Alma M edia, have implemented employee

reductions as a result. When negotiations on employee reductions must be held, Alma M edia always evaluates various support measures during the negotiation process to mitigate the problems caused to employees by the situation. These support measures may include, for example, financial support for retraining. Part of the negotiation process also involves determining whether the employee can be assigned a new role within the organisation. In order to support the re-employment of employees who are dismissed as a result of the statutory employee negotiation procedure, Alma Media also offers voluntary re-employment training to departing employees. The training is implemented by an external provider and usually includes both group and personal coaching related to topics such as searching and applying for jobs.

Focus areas for the development of corporate responsibility in 2018 According to the employer responsibility targets set in 2017, Alma M edia must achieve good scores each year in the employer image survey as well as the QWL employee survey. Alma M edia's distribution company also has a separate target of reducing its occupational accidents by half.
To achieve these targets, Alma M edia must develop the career guidance and career coaching of employees with a long-term view. These development efforts will have slightly different focus areas in different units, but the common goal is to make the development of employee competence more business-driven and needs-based, taking into account

the competence challenges created by the digital transformation of the industry. Particularly in job roles characterised by strong demand for competent professionals and high employee turnover, Alma M edia must also improve its ability to engage the commitment of skilled employees by offering meaningful career opportunities and challenges.
To this end, one of the focus areas in the development of employee competence at Alma M edia's Finnish units in 2018 will be to incorporate the lessons learned from the FutureMe project into the career guidance and career coaching of all employees. The one-to-one performance reviews between supervisors and subordinates will be updated to emphasise competence development to

an even greater extent. Going forward, the supervisors and subordinates must define annual targets for the subordinate's competence development in the one-to-one reviews. These targets must support Alma M edia's transformation into an increasingly digital media and service company.
Alma M edia estimates that approximately 90 per cent of the employees in its Finnish units had a one-to-one performance review with their supervisor in 2017. This figure is unchanged from the previous year. The estimate is based on the comparison figure obtained from an employee survey in 2016 and information obtained from other sources during the year under review.

Calculation and data collection principles for CR reporting

Alma Media publishes corporate responsibility reports once a year. As with the annual report and financial statements, this corporate responsibility report covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2017. The previous report was published in March 2017.
The corporate responsibility data was collected from the Group's internal statistical systems, subcontractors and partners. The calculation principles are compliant with the GRI Guidelines where appropriate with regards to the information available. The only exception is responsible journalism reporting. The GRI G4 Guidelines that preceded GRI Guidelines have been used there because reporting guidelines in the m edia sector have not yet been updated to keep them in line with the GRI reporting guidelines.
Financial reporting complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the figures pertaining to economic responsibility are taken from the financial statements. Reporting related to corporate governance complies with the legislation governing listed companies and the Finnish Corporate Governance Code

for listed companies. The numbers concerning environmental responsibility have primarily been collected from suppliers and the invoicing function. Location-based CO2 emissions calculations are based on emission factors provided by Statistics Finland, Finnish Energy and the IEA.
Market-based emissions calculations are based on supplier-specific emission factors and the EU member states' residual mix emission factors. Information pertaining to social responsibility is collected from HR information systems, the insurance company and, with regards to journalism, the Council for Mass Media.
In Description of the management of corporate responsibility on pages 34-38, deviations related to the reported aspects have been told. In the report, it has been stated when the reported figures are not comparable to those published last year due to more accurate reporting methods, for example.
Reporting is developed continuously to make it even more accurate and comprehensive in the future. The 2017 report has not been verified.

Dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting On 31 December 2017, the Group's parent company had distributable funds totalling EUR 134,532,841 (124,646,114). Alma Media's Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.24 per share (2016: EUR 0.16 per share) be paid for the financial year 2017. Based on the number of outstanding shares on the closing date 31 December 2017, the dividend payment totals EUR 19,733,564 (13,181,309).
No essential changes have taken place after the end of the financial year with respect to the company's financial standing. The proposed distribution of profit does not, in the view of the Board of Directors, compromise the company's liquidity.
Operating environment in 2018 The Finnish economy is expected to experience strong growth in 2018. Alma Media's significant operating countries in Eastern Central Europe, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are expected to see economic growth of 3­4%. The structural transformation of the media will continue in 2018; online content sales will grow, while the demand for print media will decline.
Outlook for 2018 In 2018, Alma Media expects its full-year revenue to remain at the previous year's level and its adjusted operating profit to increase from the 2017 level. The full-year revenue for 2017 was MEUR 367.3, and the adjusted operating profit was MEUR 51.1.
Kai Telanne, President and CEO In 2017, Alma Media's operative performance was good, and we achieved all three of our long-term financial goals. Full-year revenue grew by 4 per cent to MEUR 367 and adjusted operating profit increased by 45 per cent to MEUR 51. Earnings per share increased by 90 per cent to EUR 0.39 despite restructuring costs and impairment. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.24 per share be paid.
In the Alma Markets segment, the basic business was supported by the continued strong economic development in Eastern Central Europe and the Finnish economy returning to growth. The business segment also implemented highly active sales efforts and expanded its product portfolio. Costs were increased by investments in sales and marketing as well as the development of online services, such as the renewed Etuovi online service.
The Alma Talent segment's revenue in 2017 was on a par with the previous year, but the business unit's profitability improved substantially. The fusion synergies expected from

the merger of Alma Talent and Talent were fully achieved in 2017. Alma Talent aims to rapidly increase digital content sales and, to support this, we redesigned the Arvopaperi and Talouselämä online services last year. The business segment is also seeking synergies between the unit's different business operations, such as the book and training business.
In the Alma News & Life segment, digital advertising saw strong growth and was at a record level at the end of the year. Growth was particularly strong in programmatic buying and content marketing. The development can be attributable to major advertisers shifting from print media to national digital media. Digital business now constitutes more than half of the segment's revenue. Content revenue declined due to a decrease in Iltalehti's print circulation.
In Alma Regions, measures to ensure the profitability of publishing operations continued. The structural transformation of advertising was clearly demonstrated in the decline of regional newspaper advertising. Content revenue was increased by investments in the development of online services and sales of digital subscriptions, for example. Service revenue was increased by growth in the external revenue of printing operations.
The Finnish economy experienced a strong growth spurt in 2017, but this was not reflected in the long-awaited revival of the advertising market. According to TNS Kantar, investments in media advertising fell in 2017 by 2.8 per cent to MEUR 0.9. This level of advertising investment is not sufficient to ensure Finland's competitiveness in the long term. International platform operators account for around half of the Finnish digital advertising market. A positive aspect of this development is that, unlike in many other countries, the growth of these operators has not accelerated towards the end of the year in the Finnish advertising market.
Our rapidly growing international business operations accounted for most of our profitable growth in 2017. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia were among the fastest growing countries in 2017. Our operations outside of Finland accounted for 23 per cent of our revenue and 39 per cent of our operating profit.
Strategy and related activities during the financial period The main directions of Alma Media's strategic development include developing and expanding existing business operations as well as growth in new business areas and markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. The cornerstones of the development of the Group's business operations during the financial period were multi-channel content, marketing and advertising solutions, digital services and improving resources and competencies.

In accordance with its strategy, Alma Markets develops its operations by expanding and deepening its service offering around the current entities focused on housing, cars and recruitment. In digital service development, a transaction completed in March 2017 saw the share capital of the renovation and construction marketplace Urakkamaailma.fi become fully owned by Alma Mediapartners, a subsidiary of Alma Media. At Urakkamaailma.fi, consumers and housing companies can find verified contractors with reviews by users for renovation and construction projects. As a continuation to its previous company acquisitions in the competitive bidding and comparison market, Alma Mediapartners acquired a minority share (25%) in Muuttomaailma Oy in July 2017. Muuttomaailma.fi carries out competitive bidding between moving service providers and offers users of the Etuovi. com and Vuokraovi.com services a convenient way to arrange their move.

The strategy of Alma Media's Czech subsidiary LMC is to offer the best possible tools for the users of its recruitment services, whether they are jobseekers or employers. In addition to its basic recruitment business, LMC has expanded its product portfolio to include mobile services that take advantage of social media, such as a service focusing on recommendations from colleagues and conveniently sharing of job advertisements on social media. In 2017, LMC launched a similar employer rating service, Atmoskop. In this service, employees can share their reviews on employers and companies' corporate cultures. LMC has also successfully developed online training services to complement its recruitment services. Aimed at employee skills development, the Seduo training portal and learning platform works in cooperation with instructors, several universities and training companies to provide more than 100 online courses in different fields.
Private leasing, car sharing and other alternatives to car ownership are an emerging automotive megatrend. In spring 2017, the Alma Markets online service Autotalli.com launched a new mobility service that presents information on the various ways to gain access to a car and the costs associated with them. The aim of the new service is to make it convenient for consumers to find the right solution for gaining access to a car. The service brings together the offerings of various service providers on a single platform.

Alma Talent's business focuses on the professionals and decision-makers of different fields, offering them information, tools and training. To further broaden its target groups, Alma Talent acquired full ownership of Mediuutiset from Bonnier Business Press, which is part of the Bonnier Group, in June 2017. Prior to the acquisition, Alma Talent held a 50% stake in Mediuutiset. Mediuutiset is an independent health care news media company for physicians, medical professionals and decision-makers in public health care and companies.
In accordance with its multimedia strategy, Alma Talent aims to offer content for easy use via different channels using a reading experience of the customer's choice. January saw the launch of the first development project under Alma Talent's new strategy, the online service of Arvopaperi. Broader than its predecessor and partly behind a paywall, the new digital service represents an even better response to the needs of readers who follow the markets closely. The largest financial magazine in the Nordic countries, Talouselämä and its online service, also underwent a redesign in October.

Chatbots, customer service software robots based on artificial intelligence, are rapidly becoming more commonplace internationally. Kauppalehti launched the KL Assistant service in 2017. KL Assistant is a chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform that sends customised Kauppalehti news on selected topics at user-specified times.
Alma News & Life has invested in video production and the development of multimedia solutions in order to increase the size of its digital media audience. May 2017 saw the launch of Sensuroimaton Päivärinta (Päivärinta Uncensored), a new web TV talk show. At its peak, the audience of journalist Susanne Päivärinta's weekly live IL-TV talk show has exceeded 400,000 video starts, boosting the growth of Iltalehti's video advertising. In August 2017, Iltalehti also signed an agreement to produce news broadcasts for Bauer Media's biggest radio stations, Radio Nova and Iskelmä, from October. Radio Nova is Finland's most popular commercial radio station with 1.3 million weekly listeners. Iskelmä has over 700,000 listeners a week. (National Radio Survey, KRT). Iltalehti has produced news for Radio Nostalgia since the beginning of the year and for Business FM since the spring.
The Alma Regions segment continued to ensure the profitability of publishing operations in 2017. The Pohjolan Sanomat title that was previously published as Lapin Kansa's other edition was given up at the start of year. In addition, all digital media services were moved under the Lapin Kansa brand. The statutory personnel negotiations held in connection with the restructuring measures led to a reduction of 12 employees. In August 2017, a bill of sales was signed with Kaleva's subsidiary Kaleva365 Oy for the sale of the local newspapers published by Alma Regions in Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, the Raahen Seutu and Raahelainen papers published in Raahe and the Pyhäjokiseutu paper published in Oulainen. The cooperation negotiations conducted to secure the profitability of Alma Regions' publishing business and streamline its operations were also concluded in November 2017. As a result of the negotiations, the number of employees was reduced by 35 person-years. Most of the reductions were implemented through severance packages or retirement solutions. The negotiations concerned all employee groups in the publishing business, excluding the newspaper business of Alma Lappi and the employees of Lännen Media.
During the news coverage of the municipal elections in April 2017, Alma Regions' media used a news robot algorithm that produces text automatically based on data. Alma Media is participating in Immersive Automation, a project led by the University of Helsinki and Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. The project's news robot produced news based on data provided by the Finnish Ministry of Justice on the election results of all Finnish municipalities and their voting districts. Aamulehti also uses a bot that scans City of Tampere agendas for

keywords specified by the editorial team. Robot journalism is also utilised in financial statements analyses produced by Alma Talent and in financial news coverage to automatically update different types of dynamic elements, such as share prices and visualisations.
During the summer, Alma Media piloted a geolocation-based service at the Särkänniemi amusement park in Tampere to provide free access to the Aamulehti news application for customers visiting the park. In the future, geolocation can also be used in the delivery of other content services, such as news and tips on nearby events and attractions as well as various product and service offers that are of interest to customers. The geolocation service is part of Alma Regions' Reviiri project.
In order to offer increasingly better advertising solutions for advertisers, Alma Media initiated several measures in 2017 to improve the visibility, functioning and effectiveness of advertisements. The most important of these is the viewability project. Viewability values are used to measure how long advertisements are displayed and how well they are noticed on the screen. These have a major impact on the effectiveness of advertising. According to a survey, Alma Media's inventory of programmatic buying has obtained above average values compared to the market. Alma Media regularly monitors and develops the effectiveness of advertising together with its customers.
Content marketing is currently one of the fastest growing areas in marketing and one of Alma Media Solutions' focus areas in addition to mobile advertising and programmatic buying. Alma Media has considerably diversified its content marketing services to its advertising customers. Marketing integrated into Alma's media, such as content entities originating from the customer, individual articles supplied by advertisers and native solutions that direct the audience to the customer's own media are now complemented by videos and supported by social media channels.
At the end of the year, Alma Media established a joint eCom team between the business units to develop digital subscription sales as well as increase and share knowledge related to e-commerce. With the support of the eCom team, the the digital customer path is actively managed in order to increase reader loyalty and subscription propensity. The eCom team also enables Alma-level campaigns and measures to be implemented more easily.
As part of the development of digital services, Alma News & Life launched a new online store for its Matkapörssi service in November 2017. The reservation system of the online travel agency makes it easy to buy package tours, flights and hotel accommodation from any device. Additional services, such as transport services, seat reservations and travel insurance, can also be bought as part of the booking process.

Other decisions by the Annual General Meeting
Authorisation to the Board of Directors to repurchase own shares The AGM authorised the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of a maximum of 824,000 shares in one or more lots. The proposed maximum authorised quantity represents approximately one (1) per cent of the company's entire share capital. The shares shall be acquired using the company's non-restricted shareholders' equity through trading in a regulated market arranged by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd and in accordance with its rules and instructions, for which reason the acquisition is directed, in other words the shares will be purchased otherwise than in proportion to shareholders' current holdings. The price paid for the shares shall be based on the price of the company share in the regulated market, so that the minimum price of purchased shares is the lowest market price of the share quoted in the regulated market during the term of validity of the authorisation and the maximum price, correspondingly the highest market price quoted in the regulated market during the term of validity of the authorisation. Shares can be purchased for the purpose of improving the company's capital structure, financing or carrying out corporate acquisitions or other arrangements, implementing incentive schemes for the management or key employees, or to be otherwise transferred or cancelled. It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the following AGM; however, until no later than 30 June 2018.
Authorisation to the Board of Directors to decide on the transfer of own shares The AGM authorised the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue by transferring shares in possession of the company. A maximum of 824,000 shares may be issued on

the basis of this authorisation. The proposed maximum authorised quantity represents approximately one (1) per cent of the company's entire share capital. The authorisation entitles the Board to decide on a directed share issue, which entails deviating from the pre-emption rights of shareholders. The Board can use the authorisation in one or more parts. The Board of Directors can use the authorisation to implement incentive programmes for the management or key employees of the company.
It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the following AGM; however, until no later than 30 June 2018. This authorisation would override the corresponding share issue authorisation granted at the AGM of 17 March 2016.
Authorisation to the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue The AGM authorised the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue. The authorisation entitles the Board to issue a maximum of 16,500,000 shares. The proposed maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 20 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The share issue can be implemented by issuing new shares or transferring shares now in possession of the company. The authorisation entitles the Board to decide on a directed share issue, which entails deviating from the pre-emption rights of shareholders. The Board can use the authorisation in one or more parts.
The Board can use the authorisation for developing the capital structure of the company, widening the ownership base, financing or realising acquisitions or other arrangements, or for other purposes decided on by the Board. The authorisation cannot, however, be used to implement incentive programmes for the management or key employees of the company.
It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the following AGM; however, until no later than 30 June 2018.

Share-based incentive scheme (LTI 2015) In 2015, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation approved the establishment of a long-term share-based incentive scheme for the key management of Alma Media (hereinafter referred to as "LTI 2015").
The objective of LTI 2015 is to align the interests of the participants with those of Alma Media's shareholders by creating a long-term equity interest for the participants and, thus, to increase the company value in the long term as well as to drive performance culture, to retain participants and to offer them with competitive compensation for excellent performance in the company.
LTI 2015 consists of annually commencing individual plans, each subject to separate Board approval. Each of the individual plans consists of three main elements: an investment in Alma Media shares as a precondition for participation in the scheme, matching shares based on the above share investment and the possibility of earning performance-based matching shares.
THE MATCHING SHARE PLAN In the matching share plan, the participant receives a fixed amount of matching shares against an investment in Alma Media shares.

plans, until March 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The incentives are paid partly in cash and partly in shares. The cash component is intended to cover taxes incurred by the participant from the incentive.
The fair value of the reward is expensed until the matching shares are paid. The fair value of the share component is determined on the date on which the target group has agreed to the conditions of the plan. The financing cost arising from the obligation to hold shares and dividends expected during the vesting period have been deducted from the value of the share. The fair value of the plan based on the total shareholder return of the share also takes the market-based earning criteria into consideration. The cash component of the incentive is remeasured on each reporting date during the vesting period based on the price of the share on the date in question.
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE SCHEMES STARTED IN 2016 AND 2017 On 17 March 2016, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation decided on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2016 based on the LTI 2015 scheme (LTI 2015 II) and, on 22 March 2017, the Board made a corresponding decision on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2017 (LTI 2015 III). The main terms of the incentive schemes correspond to those of the share-based incentive scheme that was launched in 2015.

In the first matching share plan, which commenced in 2015 (LTI 2015 I), the participant receives two matching shares for each invested share free of charge after a two-year vesting period, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the share-based incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.
THE PERFORMANCE MATCHING PLAN The performance matching plan comprises a five-year performance period in total. The potential share rewards will be delivered in tranches after three and five years if the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained.
The performance measures used in the first performance matching plan, which commenced in 2015 (2015 LTI I), are based on the company's profitable growth and share value. If the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained in full, the participant will receive in total four matching shares for each invested share free of charge, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the share-based incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.
Payment of the incentive is contingent on the participant holding on to the shares invested in the plan and remaining employed by the Group for the duration of the

Other authorisations of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors also has a share issue authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting held on 22 March 2017. A maximum of 16,500,000 shares can be issued based on the authorisation. The maximum number of shares corresponds to approximately 20 per cent of the total number of shares in the company.
Market liquidity guarantee The Alma Media share has no market liquidity guarantee in effect.
Flagging notices On 15 March 2017, Alma Media Corporation received a notice of a change in shareholding pursuant to Chapter 9, Section 5 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act as follows: Otava Oy announced that Otava's holding of the shares and votes in Alma Media Corporation has risen to over ten (10) per cent.
Risks and risk management At Alma Media Group, the task of risk management is to detect, evaluate and monitor business opportunities, threats and risks to ensure the achievement of objectives and business continuity. The risk management process identifies and controls the risks,

develops appropriate risk management methods and regularly reports on risk issues to the risk management organisation and the Board of Directors. Risk management is part of Alma Media's internal control function and thereby part of good corporate governance.
The most critical strategic risks for Alma Media are a significant drop in its print newspaper readership and a decrease in the online audience of digital media, a permanent decline in advertising sales and a significant increase in distribution and delivery costs. The group subscriptions of the major financial and technology-related magazines are significant in scale. Changes to the subscription agreements could have a substantial impact on the magazines' total subscription volumes. The media industry is undergoing changes following the transformation in media consumption and technological development. Alma Media's strategic objective is to meet this challenge by developing digital products and services for consumers and businesses.
Fluctuating economic cycles are reflected in the development of advertising sales. Advertising sales account for approximately half of the Group's revenue. Business operations outside Finland, such as in Eastern and Central European countries, include country-specific risks relating to market development and economic growth. The expansion of business outside Finland has reduced the risks inherent in operating in one market area.
The most important operational risks are disturbances in information technology and data transfer, as well as an interruption of the printing operations.
Corporate Governance Statement for 2017 In 2017, Alma Media Corporation applied the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2015 for listed companies, issued by the Securities Market Association on 1 October 2015, in its unaltered form. A Corporate Governance Statement required by the Corporate Governance Code is presented as a separate report in connection with the Annual Report. In addition, it is publicly available on Alma Media's website at www.almamedia.fi/en/investors/governance/corporate-governance-statement/. The Remuneration Statement for 2017 will be issued concurrently with the CG Statement on 21 February 2018 and it will be published on the company's website at www.almamedia.fi/en/investors/governance/remuneration.
Statement on non-financial information for 2017 Alma Media will also publish its Statement on non-financial information for 2017 together with the publication of the Report by the Board of Directors on 21 February 2018. The statement will be published on the Alma Media Corporation website at www.almamedia.fi/en/investors/reports-and-presentations/financial-reports-and-annual-reviews

Accounting principles used in the consolidated financial statements

Basic information on the group Alma Media is a media company focusing on digital services and publishing. In addition to news content, the Group's products provide useful information related to lifestyle, career and business development. Alma Media builds sustainable growth for its customers by utilising the opportunities of digitalisation, including information services, system and expert services and advertising solutions. The services of Alma Media have expanded from Finland to the Nordic countries, the Baltics and Central Europe. The Group's parent company Alma Media Corporation is a Finnish public company established under Finnish law, domiciled in Helsinki at Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, PL 140, FI-00101 Helsinki.
A copy of the consolidated financial statements is available online at www.almamedia.fi or from the parent company head office.
The Board of Directors approved the financial statements for disclosure on 13 February 2018. According to the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act, shareholders have the opportunity to approve or reject the financial statements at the General Meeting of Shareholders held after publication. It is also possible to amend the financial statements at the General Meeting of Shareholders.
The figures in the financial statements are independently rounded.

The consolidated financial statements are based on the purchase method of accounting unless otherwise specified in the accounting principles below. Figures in the tables in the financial statements are presented in thousands of euros.
The Group's parent company, Alma Media Corporation (corporate ID code FI19447574, called Almanova Corporation until 7 November 2005) was established on 27 January 2005. The company acquired the shares of the previous Alma Media Corporation (corporate ID code FI14495809) during 2005. The acquisition has been treated in the consolidated accounts as a reverse acquisition based on IFRS 3. This means that the acquiring company was the old Alma Media Corporation and the company being acquired was the Group's current legal parent company, Almanova Corporation. The net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the acquisition date did not differ from their carrying values in the company's accounts. The acquisition cost was equivalent to the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and therefore no goodwill was created by the acquisition. The accounting principles adopted for the reverse acquisition apply only to the consolidated financial statements.
Impact of standards adopted during 2017 The Group has adopted the following new standards and interpretations from 1 January 2017 onwards:

Accounting principles The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS. The IAS and IFRS standards and SIC and IFRIC interpretations in effect on 31 December 2017 have been applied. International Financial Reporting Standards refer to the standards and their interpretations approved for application in the EU in accordance with the procedure stipulated in EU regulation (EU) no 1606/2002 and embodied in Finnish accounting legislation and the statutes enacted under it. The notes to the consolidated financial statements also comply with Finnish accounting and company legislation.
The Group adopted IFRS accounting principles during 2005 and in this connection applied IFRS 1 (First-time adoption), the transition date being 1 January 2004.

IAS 7Statement of Cash Flows amendment: Under the amended standard, entities must disclose changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. This covers changes from financing cash flows (such as taking out and repaying loans) as well as non-cash flow changes, such as acquisitions, disposals, accrued interest and unrealised changes in foreign exchange rates.
IAS 12Income Taxes amendment Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses:Amendments were made to IAS 12 in January 2016 to clarify the recognition of deferred taxes when an asset is measured at fair value and the fair value is lower than the taxable value of the asset in question. The amendment had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012­2014. Through the Annual Improvements procedure, small and less urgent amendments to the standards are collected and implemented together once a year. Their impacts vary standard by standard, but they have not had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

were automated. Due to the change in accrual practices. In the company's view, the amendment to the standard will not have a material effect on the accounting principles of the consolidated financial statements in future financial periods.

New and amended standards and interpretations to be applied in future periods IASB has published the following new or amended standards and interpretations that the Group has not yet applied. The Group will begin applying them starting from the effective date of each standard and interpretation or, if the date of entry into effect is not the first day of the financial year, the Group will apply the standard or interpretation starting from the beginning of the next financial year:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and amendments thereto (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018): The new standard replaces the existing IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 will change the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets. The classification and measurement of financial liabilities largely correspond to the current guidance in IAS 39. With regard to hedging, three hedging calculation types will remain in effect. More risk positions than before can be included in hedge accounting, and the principles regarding hedge accounting have been made more consistent with risk management. The Group is assessing the potential effects of the standard.
IFRS 15Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018): The new standard establishes a fivestage framework for recognising revenue from contracts with customers and replaces existing revenue guidance, including IAS 18, IAS 11 and the related interpretations. Revenue can be recognised over time or at a specific time, with the central criterion being the transfer of control. The standard will also expand the notes presented with financial statements.
An assessment was carried out in the financial year 2017 to evaluate the effect of the standard on the recognition practices in place in the Group. The report reviewed the revenue recognition processes and accrual principles used in the different invoicing systems and accounting of the Group's businesses, comparing the present situation to the requirements of the new standard. At the same time, manual practices in the revenue accrual process

IFRS 16Leases (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019): IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. As a result of the new standard, nearly all leases will be recognised in the balance sheet, as operating leases and finance leases will no longer be differentiated between. Under the new standard, a right-of-use asset is recognised, along with a financial liability representing the obligation to make future lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Lessor accounting will not be subject to significant changes. The Group is assessing the effects of the standard's implementation.
IFRS 4Insurance Contracts amendment (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018): Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. The amendment is not expected to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments have not yet been approved for application in the EU.
IFRS 2Share-based Payments (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018): Clarifications to the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions. The amendment is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments have not yet been approved for application in the EU.
Comparability of consolidated financial statements The financial years 2017 and 2016 are comparable. The company has no discontinued operations to report in the financial periods 2017 and 2016.
Translation of items denominated in foreign currencies Figures in the consolidated financial statements are shown in euro, the euro being the functional and presentation currency of the parent company. Foreign currency items are entered in euro at the rates prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary foreign currency items are translated into euro using the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary foreign currency items are measured at their fair value and translated into euro using the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. In other respects non-monetary items are measured at the rates prevailing at the transaction date. Exchange rate differences arising from sales and purchases are

GOVERNANCE

treated as additions or subtractions respectively in the statement of comprehensive income. Exchange rate differences related to loans and loan receivables are taken to other finance income and expenses in the profit or loss for the period.
The income statements of foreign Group subsidiaries are translated into euro using the weighted average rates during the period, and their balance sheets at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of foreign companies is treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign units in question and translated into euro at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Translation differences arising from the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies are entered under shareholders' equity. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of the reporting entity's net investment in the foreign operation shall be recognised in the balance sheet and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
Assets available for sale and discontinued operations Assets available for sale, and the assets related to a discontinued operation that are classified as available for sale, are measured at the lower of their book value or their fair value less the costs arising from their sale. The Group does not have assets classified under assets available for sale in the financial statements for 2017 or 2016.
Operating profit and ebitda IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements does not include a definition of operating profit or gross margin. Gross margin is the net amount formed when other operating profit is added to net sales, and material and service procurement costs adjusted for the change in inventories of finished and unfinished products, the costs arising from employee benefits and other operating expenses are subtracted from the total. Operating profit is the net amount formed when other operating profit is added to net sales, and the following items are then subtracted from the total: material and service procurement costs adjusted for the change in inventories of finished and unfinished products; the costs arising from employee benefits; depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs; and other operating expenses. All other items in the profit or loss not mentioned above are shown under operating profit. Exchange rate differences and changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are included in operating profit if they arise on items related to the company's normal business operations; otherwise they are recognised in financial items.

Adjusted items Adjusted items are income or expense arising from non-recurring or rare events. Gains or losses from the sale or discontinuation of business operations or assets, gains or losses from restructuring business operations as well as impairment losses of goodwill and other assets are recognised by the Group as adjusted items. Adjusted items are recognised in the profit and loss statement within the corresponding income or expense group. Adjusted items are described in the Report by the Board of Directors.
Accounting principles requiring management's judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions which may differ from actual results in the future. Management is also required to use its discretion as to the application of the accounting principles used to prepare the statements.
Accounting principles requiring management's judgement The management of the Group makes judgement-based decisions pertaining to the selection and application of the accounting principles used in the financial statements. This particularly applies in cases where the existing IFRS regulations allow for alternative methods of recognition, measurement and presentation. A significant area in which the management has exercised this type of judgement is related to the Group's lease agreements. The Group has significant lease agreements for its business premises. Based on assessment of the terms of the agreements, the Group has determined that it does not bear any significant rewards and risks incidental to the ownership of the premises and therefore the agreements are by nature operating lease agreements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates made in conjunction with preparing the financial statements are based on the management's best assessments on the reporting period end date. The estimates are based on prior experience, as well as future assumptions that are considered to be the most likely on the balance sheet date with regard to issues such as the expected development of the Group's economic operating environment in terms of sales and cost levels. The Group monitors the realisation of estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in the underlying factors, on a regular basis in cooperation with the business units, using both internal and external sources of information. Any changes to these estimates and assumptions are entered in the accounts for the period in which the estimate or assumption is adjusted and for all periods thereafter.

The Group's management has considered these components of the financial statements to be the most relevant in this regard, as they involve the most complicated accounting policies from the Group's perspective and their application requires the most extensive application of significant estimates and assumptions--for example, in the valuation of assets. In addition, the effects of potential changes to the assumptions and estimates used in these components of the financial statements are estimated to be the largest.
The determination of the fair value of intangible assets in conjunction with business combinations is based on the management's estimate of the cash flows related to the assets in question. The determination of the fair value of liabilities related to contingent considerations arising from business combinations are based on the management's estimate. The key variables in the change in fair value of contingent considerations are estimates of future operating profit.
Impairment tests: The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment annually and reviews any indications of impairment in the manner described above. The amounts recoverable from cash-generating units are recognised based on calculations of their fair value. The preparation of these calculations requires the use of estimates. The estimates and assumptions used to test major goodwill items for impairment, and the sensitivity of changes in these factors with respect to goodwill testing is described in more detail in the note which specifies goodwill.
Useful lives: Estimating useful lives used to calculate depreciation and amortisation also requires management to estimate the useful lives of these assets. The useful lives used for each type of asset are listed above under Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets.
Other estimates: Other management estimates relate mainly to other assets, such as the current nature of receivables and capitalised R&D costs, to tax risks, to determining pension obligations and to the utilisation of tax assets against future taxable income.

1.2 Operating income Alma Media Group's revenue consists of content revenue, advertising sales and service fees. Content revenue covers fees for content sold by the Group's media. Income from content sales arises from content sold for both print and online publications. For digital sales, content revenue is recognised over the contract period. For print publications, content revenue is recognised according to the publication calendar.
Advertising revenue consists of the sales of print and online advertising space in the Group's media. Both display advertising and classified advertising in print and online publications is reported as advertising revenue. The timing of revenue recognition from advertising sales is determined by the timing of the advertisement's publication. Revenue from the sales of advertisements with a long contract period (1­12 months) is recognised over the contract period.
The Group's service revenue includes, among other things, the sale of printing and delivery services to customers outside the Group, the Alma Talent segment's event and training business and the sale of information services. The Group also has online services aimed at consumers. Service revenue is recognised on an accrual basis in the period in which the service is delivered.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). The new standard establishes a five-stage framework for recognising revenue from contracts with customers and replaces existing revenue guidance, including IAS 18, IAS 11 and the related interpretations. Revenue can be recognised over time or at a specific time, with the central criterion being the transfer of control. The standard will also expand the notes presented with financial statements.
An assessment was carried out in the financial year 2017 to evaluate the effect of the standard on the recognition practices in place in the Group. The report reviewed the revenue recognition processes and accrual principles used in the different invoicing systems and accounting of the Group's businesses, comparing the present situation to the requirements of the new standard. At the same time, manual practices in the revenue accrual process were automated. In the company's view, the amendment to the standard will not have a material effect on the accounting principles of the consolidated financial statements in future financial periods.

1.3.3 Employee benefits expense

Personnel

Employee benefits cover short-term employee benefits, other long-term benefits, benefits paid in connection with dismissal, and post-employment benefits.
Short-term employee benefits include salaries and benefits in kind, annual holidays and bonuses. Other long-term benefits include, for example, a celebration, holiday or remuneration based on a long period of service. Benefits paid in connection with dismissal are benefits that are paid due to the termination of an employee's contract and not for service in the company.
Post-employment benefits comprise pension and benefits to be paid after termination of the employee's contract, such as life insurance and healthcare. These benefits are classified as either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. The Group has both forms of benefit plans. The accounting principles related to pensions are presented in more detail in Note 3.6 Pension obligations.
Past service costs are recognised as expenses through profit or loss at the earlier of the following: when the plan is rearranged or downsized, or a when the entity recognises the related rearrangement expenses or benefits related to the termination of employment.

1.3.6 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at the present value of the costs required to fulfil the obligation. The provision is discounted if the time-value of the money is significant with respect to the size of the provision. Examples of provisions entered by Alma Media are rental expenses on vacant office premises (loss-making agreements), provisions to cover restructuring costs, and pension obligation provisions on unemployment pension insurance.
A restructuring provision is entered when the Group has prepared and started to put into effect a detailed restructuring plan or has informed those affected by the restructuring of the key aspects of the plan. No provisions are entered for expenses related to the Group's regular operations.
A provision is entered on loss-making agreements when the immediate costs required to fulfil the obligation exceed the benefits available from the agreement.
The Group prepares monthly and quarterly estimates on the adequacy of the provisions, and the amounts are adjusted based on actual expenses and changes in estimates.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events that are not within the Group's control. A contingent liability can also be a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that the payment obligation will be realised, or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are presented in the notes to the financial statements.

The company shall have a President and CEO appointed by the Board of Directors. The President and CEO is responsible for managing the administration of the company in accordance with the instructions and requirements of the Board of Directors.
1.4.2 Share-based payments
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE PLAN 2015
In 2015, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation approved the establishment of a long-term share-based incentive scheme for the key management of Alma Media (hereinafter referred to as "LTI 2015").
The objective of LTI 2015 is to align the interests of the participants with those of Alma Media's shareholders by creating a long-term equity interest for the participants and, thus, to increase the company value in the long term as well as to drive performance culture, to retain participants and to offer them with competitive compensation for excellent performance in the company.
LTI 2015 consists of annually commencing individual plans, each subject to separate Board approval. Each of the individual plans consists of three main elements: an investment in Alma Media shares as a precondition for participation in the scheme, matching shares based on the above share investment and the possibility of earning performance-based matching shares.

THE MATCHING SHARE PLAN
In the matching share plan, the participant receives a fixed amount of matching shares against an investment in Alma Media shares. In the first matching share plan, which commenced in 2015 (LTI 2015 I), the participant receives two matching shares for each invested share free of charge after a two-year vesting period, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the share-based incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.
THE PERFORMANCE MATCHING PLAN
The performance matching plan comprises a five-year performance period in total. The potential share rewards will be delivered in tranches after three and five years if the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained.
The performance measures used in the first performance matching plan, which commenced in 2015 (2015 LTI I), are based on the company's profitable growth and share value. If the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained in full, the participant will receive in total four matching shares for each invested share free of charge, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the share-based incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE SCHEMES STARTED IN 2016 AND 2017: LTI 2015 II AND LTI 2015 III
On 18 March 2016, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation decided on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2016 based on the LTI 2015 scheme (LTI 2015 II) and, on 23 March 2017, the Board made a corresponding decision on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2017 (LTI 2015 III). The main terms of the incentive schemes correspond to those of the share-based incentive scheme that was launched in 2015.
The Board of Directors has estimated that no new shares will be issued in connection with LTI 2015. Therefore, the plan will have no dilutive effect on the number of the company's registered shares.
The Annual General Meeting of Alma Media Corporation held on 17 March 2016 authorised the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of a maximum of 824,000 shares in one or more lots, and further authorised the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue by transferring shares in possession of the company to implement incentive programmes.

2 tangible and intangible assets, investment properties and leasing arrangements
2.1 Intangible assets and goodwill

Goodwill created through mergers and acquisitions is recorded at the amount by which the sum of the purchase price, the share of the non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and the purchaser's previously held share in the entity exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired. Acquisitions carried out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 were recognised according to the previous version of IFRS 3 (2004). Goodwill created through mergers that were carried out prior to 2004 corresponds with the book value under earlier accounting standards, which was used as the acquisition cost in accordance with the IFRS standards. Goodwill is applied to cash-generating units and tested on the transition date and thereafter annually for impairment. Goodwill is measured at the original acquisition cost less impairment losses.
Research costs are entered as an expense in the period in which they arise. Development costs arising from the development of new or significantly improved products are capitalised as intangible assets when the costs of the development stage can be reliably determined, the product is technically feasible and economically viable, the product is expected to produce an economic benefit and the Group has the intention and the required resources to complete the development effort. Capitalised development costs include the costs of material, labour and testing, as well as capitalised borrowing costs, if any, that directly arise from the process of making the product complete for its intended purpose. Development costs that have previously been recognised as expenses will not be capitalised at a later date.
Patents, copyright and software licenses with a finite useful life are shown in the balance sheet and expensed on a straight-line basis in the profit or loss during their useful lives. No depreciation is entered on intangible assets with an indefinite useful life; instead, these are tested annually for impairment. In Alma Media, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are trademarks measured at fair value at the time of acquisition.
The useful lives of intangible assets are 3­10 years.

Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives
On each balance sheet date, the Group assesses the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. In addition, the recoverable amounts are assessed annually of goodwill, capitalised development costs for projects in progress and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. These are assessed regardless of whether or not indications of impairment exist. The recoverable amounts of intangible and tangible assets are determined as the higher of the fair value of the asset less cost to sell, or the value in use. The value in use refers to the estimated future net cash flows obtainable from the asset or cash-generating unit, discounted to their current value. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. An impairment loss may be reversed if circumstances regarding the intangible or tangible assets in question change. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are never reversed.

Goodwill, intangible rights with indefinite useful lives and other long-term assets are tested at the level of cash generating units. In testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is the value in use.
Following the model used before, estimated cash flows determined in the test are based on the Group's strategic forecasts for the following three years confirmed by the Board of Directors and business units' management. The years following this period are estimated by the management, taking the business cycle into account. The calculations of value in use are based on a period of 10 years, as the customer relationships in the business are long-term and turnover is low. In addition, the management uses cash flow analyses of 10 years to support business decisions in connection with corporate acquisitions. The cash flow of the terminal year is normalised as an average of the forecast period. In addition to general economic factors, the main assumptions and variables used when determining cash flows are the forecast growth of advertising sales in different market segments, the unit-specific average cost of capital (discount rate) and estimated growth of newspaper content sales. The growth rate assumptions for advertising sales vary in different market segments and in different product categories. When evaluating growth, past events in the Group and the impact of business cycles are taken into account.
The Group's business, advertising sales in particular, is very dependent on business cycles. A significant portion of the Group's revenue is generated from advertising sales. Advertising sales correlates significantly with changes in the gross national product, and changes in advertising sales are largely intensified at cyclical turns. Investments in advertising have been particularly low in Finland in relation to the level of GDP in 20102017, even in international comparison. Alma Media estimates that the gross national product will start growing in the domestic market. The growth assumptions for revenue and costs used in the value in use calculations are presented in the table below.
According to its strategy, the Group has invested in the development of digital products and services. Digital services account for approximately 43% of the Group's revenue. In digital services, the realised changes are larger and the future growth assumptions higher than in average advertising investments. With regard to the printing business, moderate revenue growth assumptions have been used in impairment testing.
The discount rate used in impairment testing has been determined using geographical (country) and business-specific weighted average cost of capital (WACC) separately for both publishing & newspapers and online business segments. The discount rate is determined net of taxes. The WACC consists of the required return on equity

GOVERNANCE

and the required return on debt after corporate taxes (net of taxes as adjusted for final presentation purposes). Following capital market theory, the generally accepted method of estimating the cost of equity is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Following the CAPM, the rate of return on equity can be constructed from the risk free interest rate and a risk premium. Elements of WACC/CAPM have been determined for impairment testing by an independent third party analyst.

The business operations tested in the Alma Regions segment are combined so that the testing applies to the entire Regions business entity as one testing, cash generating unit. The operations are managed as a single integrated process. The joint operations account for a particularly significant part of the cost structure of a product/service. For this reason, changes have been made from the previous year. Previously, each region constituted its own business unit for testing.

The WACC accounting principle was updated in 2017. Previously, WACC was calculated separately for the publishing and online businesses. Due to the growing share of digital services even in the traditional media business, the WACCs were combined into one media business WACC. The comparison group used on the basis of the WACC calculation was also expanded and updated to be more appropriate for media business operations. Due to this change, the WACC of the online business has decreased and the WACC of the publishing business has correspondingly increased. In our view, there are no longer any major differences between the businesses with regard to risk.
Changes from 2016 The recruitment business of the Alma Markets segment has been combined into one unit for testing. This entity comprises Monster FI, Recruitment Czech Republic, Profesia, TAU Online and CV Online, which were previously tested separately. The unit is managed uniformly and significant joint development work is carried out at the product and service level. Newly developed services are increasingly often uniformly adopted in the different countries of operation for the recruitment business.
In the Alma Talent segment, the tested units were changed so that the units that generate cash flow were defined on a country level as Talent Finland and Talent Sweden. Talent Finland consists of the following, previously separately tested units: Alma Talent Media Finland, Pro + events, Suoramarkkinointi Mega and Kauppalehti Information Services. Alma Talent Sweden comprises Alma Talent Sweden and Objektvision. At the country level, the units are managed in a uniform manner. In addition, the products and services have many shared process and system solutions at the country level. At Talent Finland, major integration efforts have been made over the last two years in order to harmonise the services and related processes. In Sweden, the operations of Objektivision and Media Sweden have been combined under a joint organisation.

Alma Media Corporation deemed a property at Patamäenkatu 7 in Tampere. The property is Aamulehti's old office and printing facility, and it is currently fully rented out. The value of the property will be reviewed as part of the regular impairment testing process (Note on investment properties 2.3).

In connection with the sensitivity analysis, the impact of an increase in the discount rate (at most 3%), a decrease in advertising sales (at most 6%) and a decrease in content sales (at most 3%) on estimated cash flows has been estimated. The sensitivity analysis of advertising sales and content sales is based on the management view of the future development on the balance sheet date.
The aggregate book values of the Alma Markets segment were approximately 19% of the current value of the estimated recoverable amount at the time of testing. The impact of the terminal on the value in use varied between 44% and 52%. Based on the analysis carried out by the management, the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows has risen by a total of MEUR 91.7 compared to 2016. This is based on the improved profitability of business operations in 2017. The development of profitability is expected to continue in the coming years. The book value of the assets of the Alma Markets segment on the reporting date was MEUR 68.9. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Alma Markets business does not include a significant risk of future impairment.

Impairment losses and their allocation During the past financial year, the Group recognised MEUR 4.0 in impairment losses on goodwill. The impairment loss is recognised on investment properties. In the management's view, there are no indications of impairment with regard to the other units of Alma Media Group.
In the previous financial year, the Group recognised MEUR 3.0 in impairment losses on goodwill. Of this impairment loss, MEUR 2.0 was allocated to the goodwill of Alma Lapland, and MEUR 1.0 is allocated to the goodwill of Alma Talent Sweden. Alma Lapland was reported under the Alma Regions segment. After the recognition of the impairment loss, asset items of MEUR 0.3 were allocated to Alma Lapland. Alma Talent Sweden was reported as part of the Alma Talent segment. After the recognition of the impairment loss, asset items of MEUR 10.0 were allocated to Alma Talent Sweden.
Sensitivity analyses of impairment testing Goodwill allocated to new business areas, as well as goodwill arising from recent acquisitions, is more sensitive to impairment testing and therefore more likely to be subject to impairment loss when the above main assumptions change.

The aggregate book values of the Alma Talent segment were approximately 46% of the current value of the estimated recoverable amount at the time of testing. The impact of the terminal on the value in use was 48% in the calculations. Based on the analysis carried out by the management, the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows has risen by a total of MEUR 13.9 compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to improved profitability especially in Talent Finland, where cost adoption measures were implemented in 2016. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, Alma Talent segment's business is subject to an impairment risk of MEUR 0.5 if advertising sales decline permanently by 6%.
The aggregate book values of the Alma News & Life segment were approximately 22% of the current value of the estimated recoverable amount at the time of testing. The impact of the terminal on the value in use was 47% in the calculations. Based on the analysis carried out by the management, the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows has in practice remained unchanged from the previous year (change MEUR +0.6). Profitability has remained at the same level in 2017 as in previous years, as the growth of digital advertising sales has offset the decline in print media. The growth in digital business and, correspondingly, the declining single-copy sales of the print edition have the greatest impact on estimates of the business unit's future cash flows. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Alma News & Life business does not include a significant risk of future impairment.

The aggregate book values of the Alma Regions segment were approximately 44% of the current value of the estimated recoverable amount at the time of testing. The impact of the terminal on the value in use is 47%. Based on the analysis carried out by the management, the estimated net present value (NPV) of future cash flows has declined by a total of MEUR 15.7 compared to 2016. Profitability remained on a par with 2016 mainly due to cost savings achieved through restructuring and efficiency improvement measures. The reduced net present value is due to lower expectations for profit development in the coming years. The development of revenue from print newspapers in the coming years remains uncertain. The internal rental cost for the Group's printing facility is included in Alma Regions' cash flow statement, which means that the Patamäentie 9 property was no longer tested separately. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Alma Regions business does not include a significant risk of future impairment.
The cash flow based statement on the investment property is based on a forecast of the 2018 rent and maintenance expense. The electricity savings obtained from the ventilation equipment renovation has been taken into account for 2019. In investments, account has been taken of the ventilation equipment renovation for 2018 and the basic renovation investments estimated for 2019­2020. The DCF calculation results in a fair value of MEUR 10.5. If the measurement is assessed through net profit in one year (2018), the fair value of MEUR 10.5 corresponds to a return requirement of approx. 8.5%, taking into account the renovation investment needs. Based on the sensitivity analysis, an impairment of MEUR 4 is allocated to the investment property.

2.2 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. The acquisition cost includes the costs arising directly from the acquisition of a tangible asset. In the event that a tangible asset comprises several components with different useful lives, each component will be recognised as a separate asset.

Straight line depreciation is entered on the assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is not entered on land. The estimated useful lives are:

Structures 

5 years

Machinery and equipment 

3­15 years

Large rotation printing presses 

20 years

The residual value and useful life of an asset are reviewed, at a minimum, at the end of each financial period and adjusted, where necessary, to reflect the changes in their expected useful lives.
When an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced, the costs related to this new item are capitalised. The same procedure is applied in the case of major inspection or service operations. Other costs arising later are capitalised only when they give the company added economic benefit from the asset. All other expenses, such as normal service and repair procedures, are entered as an expense in the profit or loss as they arise.
Gains and losses arising from the decommissioning and sale of tangible assets are recognised through profit and loss under other operating income and expenses. The gains or losses on sale are defined as the difference between the selling price and the remaining acquisition cost.

2.3. Investment properties
Investment properties are properties held by the Group in order to gain rental income or an increase in the value of assets or both. Investment properties are measured on the balance sheet at the original acquisition cost less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. Transaction costs, such as asset transfer tax and professional fees, are included in the original estimate.
The buildings of investment properties are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, 30­40 years. Land areas included in properties are not amortised.
An investment property is derecognised when it is transferred or permanently removed from use.
Media used the interruption option included in the rental agreement for the office and production facility in its use and redeemed the property from DNB Bank ASA on Patamäenkatu 7 in Tampere.
The property is Aamulehti's old office and printing facility, and it is currently fully rented out. The lease ratio of the property is currently 90 per cent. The gross leasable area of the property is 18,500 sqm.
The property is classified as an investment property according to the IAS 40 standard on Investment Property, and Alma Media will apply to the investment property the acquisition cost model in which the property is valued according to the acquisition cost less depreciation, which is based on the property's financial useful life.
The value of the property presented in the notes to the financial statements will be tested as part of Alma Media Group's regular impairment testing process (Note 2.1).

3.2 Financial assets
The Group's financial assets have been classified into the following categories as required by IAS 39: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables as well as available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets are classified according to their purpose when acquired and at the time of acquisition. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are contingent considerations from the sales of the business operations and derivatives. Contingent considerations arise in sales of business operations. The company employs derivative instruments to hedge against changes in paper and electricity prices and interest rate derivatives to hedge against changes in interest rates of financial liabilities. Contingent considerations and derivatives are measured at fair value as they arise and remeasured on the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of the contingent considerations are recognised in the profit or loss. Changes in fair value of paper derivatives are recognised under Material Purchases and of electricity derivatives under Other Operating Costs in the profit or loss. Changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recognised in the profit or loss. Matured derivatives are recognised in the profit or loss in the period during which they mature.
The evaluation of contingent considerations and liabilities is based on the discounted values of future cash flows. The evaluation is conducted on each reporting date based on the terms of consideration agreements. Management estimates the realisation of terms on each reporting date and the fair value is recognised as discounted values of capitalised cash flows.
Loans and Other Receivables are measured at their amortised cost. In Alma Media, this group consists of trade receivables and other receivables. The amount of uncertain receivables is estimated based on the risks associated with individual items. A debtor experiencing considerable financial difficulties, the probability of bankruptcy, the failure to make payments or a payment being delayed by more than 180 days are considered evidence of the impairment of trade receivables. Credit losses are entered as an expense in the profit or loss. Held to maturity investments are financial assets that mature on a given date and which the Group intends and is able to keep until this date. These are measured at amortised cost. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at their fair value and the change in fair value is entered in other comprehensive income and presented under shareholders' equity. Accrued changes in fair value are transferred from shareholders' equity to profit or loss as adjustments arising from reclassification when the asset is sold or when its value has decreased to the extent that impairment loss is recognised. This category comprises financial assets that are not classified in any of the other categories. The Group also classifies investments in unquoted shares in this category, but these investments are measured at acquisition cost in the financial statements because they cannot be reliably measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, demand and time deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments. The transaction date is generally used when recognising financial assets. Financial assets are derecognised from the balance sheet when the Group has lost the contractual right to the cash flows or when the Group has transferred a substantial portion of the risks and income to an external party.
On the final day of each reporting period, the Group evaluates whether there is objective evidence of impairment with regard to an individual financial asset or a group of financial assets.

3.3 Financial liabilities
The determination of the fair value of liabilities related to contingent considerations arising from business combinations are based on the management's estimate. The key variables in the change in fair value of contingent considerations are estimates of future operating profit. Contingent liabilities arising from acquisitions are classified as financial liabilities through profit or loss. They are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the change in fair value is recognised in the financial items through profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. Later other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are included in current and long-term liabilities and can be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing.
Costs arising from interest-bearing liabilities are expensed in the period in which they arise. The Group has not capitalised its borrowing costs because the Group does not incur borrowing costs on the purchase, building or manufacturing of an asset in the manner specified in IAS 23.

The table describes the Group's non-current and current financial liabilities.

The company's main financial instruments in 2017 were non-current finance leases, current commercial papers and financial loans. The hedging of the interest rate risk is described in more detail in Note 3.8 Financial risks.
The average interest rate of the Group's financial liabilities in 2017 was 2.5% (2.7% in 2016).

The Group has categorised items recognised at fair value through profit or loss according to the following hierarchy of fair values.

MEUR Level 1 Commodity derivatives Level 2 Foreign currency derivative Interest rate derivatives Level 3 Contingent consideration liabilities arising from the acquisition of business operations

2017 0.0
0.2 0.5

2016 0.0 0.0 0.7
0.1

Level 1 includes the quoted (unadjusted) prices of identical liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 instruments' fair values are, to a significant degree, based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, but nevertheless on data that can be either directly or indirectly verified for the asset or liability in question.

Level 3 includes inputs concerning liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

No transfers between the fair value hierarchy levels have taken place during the ended financial period and the previous financial period.

There are no contingent liabilities arising from acquisitions on the balance sheet on 31 December 2017. Contingent consideration liabilities arising from the acquisition of business operations on the balance sheet on 31 December 2016 were based on the companies' revenue in 2016.

The book values of financial liabilities correspond to their fair values. The table below separately describes the fair values of derivative contracts and the value of the underlying instruments.

The fair values of forward exchange contracts are determined using the market prices for contracts of similar duration on the balance sheet date. The fair values of interest rate swaps have been determined using a method based on the present value of future cash flows, supported by market interest rates and other market information on the balance sheet date. The fair values of commodity derivatives are determined using publicly quoted market prices. The fair values correspond to the prices the Group would pay or receive in an orderly transaction for the derivative contract in the prevailing market conditions on the balance sheet date.
The maturity distribution of financial liabilities is described in more detail in Note 3.8. Financial risks.

3.4 Other leases
Leases applying to tangible assets in which the Group holds a significant share of the risks and rewards incidental to their ownership are classified as finance leases. These are recognised in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities at the lower of their fair value or the present value of the required minimum lease payments at inception of the lease. Assets acquired through finance leases are depreciated over their useful life, or over the lease term, if shorter. Lease obligations are included under interest-bearing liabilities. Other leases are those in which the risks and rewards incidental to ownership remain with the lessor. When the Group is the lessee, lease payments related to other leases are allocated as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease payments of future periods are presented as contingent liabilities in the notes. When the Group is the lessor, lease

income is entered in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group has made purchasing agreements that include a lease component. Any such arrangements in effect are treated according to the IFRIC 4 interpretation and the arrangements are accounted for based on their actual content. The Group's current purchasing agreements that include a lease component are treated as other leases in accordance with IAS 17.

Purchase obligation On 24 October 2016 Alma Media gave notice of the interruption option included in the rental agreement for the office and production facility in its use and its intention to redeem the property from DNB Bank ASA on Patamäenkatu 7 in Tampere. The property transaction, which is estimated at EUR 14.8 million, was carried out and recognised in the balance sheet on 30 October 2017. The property is classified as an investment property according to the IAS 40 standard on Investment Property, Note 2.3. In 2016, the rental commitment related to the lease agreement was presented in Rental commitments.
3.6 Pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution pension plans and defined benefit pension plans.
The defined benefit pension plans comprise the Group's old supplementary pension plans for personnel, which have already been discontinued and closed. The benefits associated with them include both supplementary pension benefits and death benefits. The Group's defined benefit pension plans include both funded and unfunded pension plans. The unfunded pension plans are direct supplementary pension obligations, primarily for old employees who have already retired.
The new supplementary pension benefits granted by the Group are defined contribution based pension plans.
Payments made under defined contribution plans are entered in the profit or loss in the period that the payment applies to. The disability pension component of the Finnish Employees' Pension System (Tyel) handled by insurance companies was reclassified under IFRS as a defined contribution plan from the beginning of 2006. Accordingly, it is treated as a defined contribution plan in the financial statements. Defined benefit plans are all those that do not meet the criteria for a defined contri-

bution plan. In the Group, supplementary pension obligations arising from voluntary plans are treated as defined benefit plans. In a defined benefit pension plan, the company is left with additional obligations also after the payment for the period is made.

Obligations arising from defined benefit plans are calculated for each arrangement separately using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Pension costs are recognised as expenses over the beneficiaries' period of employment in the Group based on calculations made by authorised actuaries. The discount rate used in calculating the present value of the pension obligation is based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds issued by the company and, if this data is not available, on yields of government bonds. The maturity of corporate and government bonds and corresponds to a reasonable extent with the maturity of the pension obligation. The pension plan assets measured at fair value on the balance sheet date are deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to be recognised in the balance sheet. The net liabilities (or assets) associated with the defined benefit pension plan are recorded on the balance sheet.

Service costs for the period (pension costs) and the net interest on the net liabilities associated with the defined benefit plan are recognised through profit or loss and presented under employee benefit expenses. Items (such as actuarial gains and losses and return on funded defined benefit plan assets) arising from the redefinition of the net liabilities (or assets) associated with the defined benefit plan are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

The sensitivity analysis uses the same methods as the calculation of the pension obligation. Sensitivity is calculated for changes in the discount rate, the salary increase assumption, pension increases and the insurance company's bonus index. Sensitivity has been calculated by changing one parameter at a time.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED

LIFE EXPECTANCY
As the majority of the obligations under the plans are related to providing lifelong benefits to the members, the expected increase in life expectancy will result in higher obligations under the plans.

3.7 Working capital
3.7.1 Inventories
Inventories are materials and supplies, work in progress and finished goods. Fixed overhead costs are capitalised to inventories in manufacturing. Inventories are measured at the lower of their acquisition cost or net realisable value. The net realisable value is the sales price expected to be received on them in the normal course of business less the estimated costs necessary to bring the product to completion and the costs of selling. The acquisition cost is defined by the FIFO (first-in-first-out) method. Within Alma Media, inventories mainly comprise the production materials used for newspaper printing and the products sold by the book business.

Defined benefit plans expose the Group to several different risks, the most significant of which are the following:
ASSET VOLATILITY
The calculation of the liabilities arising from the plans uses a discount rate based on the yield of bonds issued by the company. If the yield on the assets used for the plan is lower than this level, there will be a deficit.
INFLATION RISK
Some of the benefit obligations under the plans are tied to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although a ceiling for inflation adjustments has been set in most cases to protect the plan from unusually high inflation).

All trade receivables overdue by more than 180 days are recognised as expenses via a provision for bad debts. A provision for bad debts of MEUR 0.4 (0.5) is included in receivables in 2017. In the 2017 financial year, credit losses of MEUR 0.5 were recognised in the Group (in 2016 MEUR 0.5). The credit losses totalled 0.1% of revenue in 2017 (0.1% in 2016).

The book values of trade receivables, other current and non-current receivables and other current investments are estimated to correspond to fair values. The impact of discounting is not significant.

3.7.3 Trade payables and other liabilities The book values of trade payables and other liabilities are estimated to correspond with their fair values. The impact of discounting is not significant taking the maturity of the liabilities into account.

The main items in accrued expenses and prepaid income are allocated wages, salaries and other employee expenses.

 3.8 Financial risks Financial risk management is part of the Group's risk management policy. The risk management strategy and plan, the control limits imposed and the course of action are reviewed annually. The Group has a risk management organisation tasked with identifying the risks threatening the company's business, assess and update them, develop the necessary risk management methods and regularly report on the risks.
Alma Media categorises its financial risks as follows:
INTEREST RATE RISK The interest rate risk describes how changes in interest rates and maturities related to various interest-bearing business transactions and balance sheet items could affect the Group's financial position and net result. The impact of the interest rate risk on net result can be reduced using interest rate swaps, interest forwards and futures and interest or foreign exchange options. On the balance sheet date the Group had open interest rate swaps, which are described in more detail in Note 3.3.
The Group's interest-bearing debt totalled MEUR 61 (80.4) on 31 December 2017. Interest-bearing debt comprises loans from financial institutions, commercial papers and finance lease liabilities. The interest-bearing liabilities are linked to variable interest rate debt instruments. Taking the interest rate swaps into account, the average period of interest linkage of the Group's financial portfolio at the end of 2017 was 2.8 years and the hedging rate 32%. An increase of one percentage point in the interest rate would increase the Group's finance expenses by MEUR 0.4.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK Transaction risk The transaction risk describes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on sales, purchases and balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies Alma Media's most significant currencies in addition to the euro are the Czech koruna and the Swedish krona. The impact of changes in exchange rates on net result in the most important currencies of the Group can be reduced by the following measures: · Cash flows in the same currency are netted through a common foreign currency
account whenever the cost/benefit ratio is significant known, · Continuous and significant foreign currency cash flow is hedged. The Czech ko-
runa is hedged at approximately 30­50% of the cash flow accrued during the next two years.

Translation risk A foreign exchange risk that arises from the translation of foreign investments into the functional currency of the parent company, the euro. The risk associated with translating long-term net investments in foreign currencies is assessed on a regular basis. Should there be a clear and permanent risk of a currency devaluating, Group management may decide to hedge the company's foreign currency exposure.
The Group's open foreign currency derivatives on the balance sheet date are described in Note 3.3.
Commodity risk The commodity risk refers to the impact of changes in the prices of commodities, such as raw materials, on the Group's net result. The Group regularly assesses its commodity risk exposure and hedges this risk employing generally used commodity derivatives whenever this is possible and economically viable.
The Group has hedged its electricity purchases as follows: the price level of electricity purchases for the following 12 months are hedged at 70­100%, and the price level of electricity purchases for the following 12­24 months is hedged at 35­85%. Electricity prices for the following 25­36 months are hedged at 0­40%. The Group had open electricity forwards on the balance sheet date. The values of these open electricity forwards are described in more detail in Note 3.3.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT RISKS Liquidity management Alma Media has two MEUR 15 financing limits at its disposal, both of which were unused on 31 December 2017. In addition, Alma Media ensures its liquidity by issuing its own commercial papers if required via brokers, and hedges over-liquidity according to its treasury policy. Liquidity is assessed daily and liquidity forecasts are made at weekly, monthly and 12-month rolling intervals.
On the balance sheet date, the company had a commercial paper programme of MEUR 100 in Finland. Within the programme, the company may issue commercial papers to a total value of MEUR 0­100. No commercial papers were in circulation on the balance sheet date 31 December 2017. In addition to the commercial paper programme, the company may use the existing financing limit agreements for financing the need for working capital.
Long-term capital funding To secure its long-term financing needs, Alma Media uses capital market instruments, leasing or other financial arrangements.

CREDIT RISK The Group's credit policy is described and documented in the Group credit management policy. The Group does not have significant risks of past due receivables, because it has a large customer base and no individual customer will comprise a significant amount. During the financial period, impairment losses of MEUR 0.5 were recognised through profit or loss. These impairment losses were caused by an unexpected change in customers' economic environment. The maturity structure of trade receivables is presented in Note 3.7.2 Trade and other receivables.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The aim of the Group's capital management is to support business operations through an optimal capital structure and to secure normal business preconditions. The capital structure is influenced through dividend distribution, for example. The development of the Group's capital structure is continuously monitored with gearing and equity ratio key figures. The company's financing agreements contain covenants concerning the company's equity ratio and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. The following describes the values of these key figures in 2017 and 2016.

3.9 Information on shareholders' equity and its management The Group classifies the instruments it has issued in either equity or liabilities (financial liabilities) based on their nature. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Expenses related to the issuance or acquisition of equity instruments are presented as a deduction from equity. If the Group acquires equity instruments of its own, their acquisition cost is deducted from equity.

BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES SYSTEM The company's shares belong to the book-entry system.

4. Consolidation
4.1 General principles of consolidation
All subsidiaries are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are companies in which the Group has a controlling interest. The criteria for control are fulfilled when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The accounting principles applied in the subsidiaries have been brought into line with the IFRS principles applied in the consolidated financial statements. Mutual holdings are eliminated using the purchase method. Purchase consideration and the individualised assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised at their fair value on the acquisition date. The costs related to the acquisition, with the exception of costs arising from the issue of equity or debt securities, are recorded as expenses. Additional purchase cost, if applicable, is recognised at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability through profit or loss. Additional purchase cost classified as a liability is measured through profit or loss at fair value on the last day of each reporting period.

Redemption of shares A shareholder whose proportional holding of all company shares, or whose proportional entitlement to votes conferred by the company shares, either individually or jointly with other shareholders, is or exceeds 33.3% or 50% is obligated on demand by other shareholders to redeem such shareholders' shares.

3.9.1 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of diluted shares during the period.

The information from the sub-group's financial statements is presented in the table below according to Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS), as the financial statements have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the time when the Group gains the right of control, and divested subsidiaries until the Group ceases to exercise the right of control. All intra-Group transactions, receivables, liabilities and profits are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The distribution of the profit for the year between the parent company owners and non-controlling interest shareholders is shown in the statement of comprehensive income. The eventual non-controlling interest in the acquired companies is measured at fair value or to the amount corresponding to the share of the non-controlling interest based on the proportionate share of the specified net assets. The measurement method is defined for each acquisition separately.
The comprehensive income is attributed to parent company shareholders and non-controlling shareholders, even if this were to lead to a negative portion being attributed to non-controlling shareholders. The amount of shareholders' equity attributable to non-controlling shareholders is shown as a separate item in the balance sheet under shareholders' equity. Changes in the parent company's holding in a subsidiary that do not lead to a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.
In conjunction with acquisitions achieved in stages, the previous holding is measured at fair value through profit or loss. When the Group loses control in a subsidiary, the remaining investment is measured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control in the subsidiary is lost, and the difference is recognised through profit or loss.
Acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2010 are recognised according to the provisions valid at the time.

4.4 Investments in associated companies and joint ventures

Summary (100%) of associated company and joint venture totals.

Associated companies are those in which the Group has a significant controlling interest. A significant controlling interest arises when the Group holds 20% or more of the company's voting rights or over which the Group otherwise is able to exercise significant control. A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, whereas in a joint operation, the Group has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Associated companies and joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. Investments in associated companies include any goodwill arising from their acquisition. If the Group's share of the associated company's losses exceeds the book value of the investment, this investment is entered at zero value in the balance sheet and any losses in excess of this value are not recognised unless the Group has obligations with respect to the associated companies. The Group's share of the results of its associated companies is shown as a separate item after operating profit. The Group's share of its associated companies' other changes in comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive income statement under other comprehensive income.

5.1 Income tax The tax expense in the profit or loss comprises the tax based on the company's taxable income for the period together with deferred taxes. The tax based on taxable income for the period is the taxable income calculated on the applicable tax rate in each country of operation. The tax is adjusted for any tax related to previous periods.

5.2 Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on all temporary differences between their book and actual tax values. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates enacted by the balance sheet date. However, the deferred tax liability is not recognised on the initial recognition of goodwill or if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. A deferred tax liability is recognised on non-distributed retained earnings of subsidiaries when it is likely that the tax will be paid in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by the company when they relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority and when the tax authority permits the company to pay or receive a single net tax payment. Deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. For this purpose, the conditions for the recognition of deferred taxes are assessed on the final day of each reporting period.

RECONCILIATION OF TAX EXPENSES IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND TAX CALCULATED ON FINNISH TAX RATE

The Finnish corporate tax rate in 2017 was 20% and in 2016 20%. In the calculation of deferred taxes, 20% has been used as the Finnish corporate tax rate in 2017.

No deferred tax asset has been calculated on the confirmed losses of Group companies in Finland, amounting to MEUR 0.1, and abroad, amounting to MEUR 6.2. Utilisation of this tax asset requires that the normal operations of such companies would generate taxable income. The losses expire in 2024 at the latest for losses other than those of Group companies in Sweden.

Accounting principles used in the parent company's financial statements

General information Alma Media Corporation is a Finnish public limited company incorporated under Finnish law. Its registered office is in Helsinki at the address Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, P.O. Box 140, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.

Inventories The balance sheet value of inventories is the lesser of the direct acquisition cost or the net realisable value. The acquisition cost is defined by the FIFO (first-in-first-out) method.

Parent company's financial statements The financial statements of the parent company are prepared in accordance with Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS).

The parent company was established on 27 January 2005. On 7 November 2005, the old Alma Media Corporation was merged with Almanova Corporation, which adopted the name Alma Media Corporation after the merger. The merger difference arising in conjunction with the merger has been capitalised to the Group's shares.

Non-current assets Tangible and intangible assets are capitalised at direct acquisition cost less planned depreciation and write-downs. Planned depreciation is calculated from the original acquisition cost based on the estimated economic life of the asset. The land areas are not depreciated. The economic lifetimes of the assets are as follows:

Buildings 

30­40 years

Structures5 years

Machinery and equipment

3­10 years

Other non-current expenses 5­10 years

Intangible rights

5­10 years

Research and development costs Research costs are recognised as an expense in the financial period during which they are incurred. Development costs are capitalised when it is expected that the intangible asset will generate future economic added value and the costs arising from this can be reliably determined.

Taxes Taxes in the income statement are the taxes corresponding to the results of the Group companies during the financial year as well as adjustments to taxes in previous years. No deferred tax assets are recognised in the parent company's accounts.
Foreign currency items Foreign currency items are entered at the rates prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables and payables on the balance sheet are valued at the average rate on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from sales and purchases are treated as additions or subtractions, respectively, in the income statement. Realised and unrealised exchange rate differences related to loans and loan receivables are recognised in other financial income and expenses in the income statement. The parent company does not have any significant foreign currency loans.
Pension commitments Statutory and voluntary employee pension benefits for the parent company's personnel are arranged mainly through pension insurance companies.
Other employee benefits The parent company has a long-term share-based incentive scheme for key management in effect (LTI 2015). In accordance with Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS), the option benefit and the share reward are not measured at fair value, nor is the calculated employee benefit expensed in the income statement

Auditor's Report

To the Annual General Meeting of Alma Media Oyj
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion In our opinion · the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's
financial position and financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU · the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
Our opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
What we have audited We have audited the financial statements of Alma Media Oyj (business identity code 1944757-4) for the year ended 31 December 2017. The financial statements comprise: · the consolidated balance sheet, statement of comprehensive income, statement
of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies · the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and notes.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 1.3.5 to the Financial Statements.

Our Audit Approach

Overview

Materiality

· We have applied an overall group materiality of EUR 3.6 million

Group scoping

· We have audited parent company and its subsidiaries in Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden

Key audit matters

· Timing of revenue recognition · Valuation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives · Valuation of holdings in group companies (Parent com-
pany)

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.

Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.

Key audit matter in the audit of the group
TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION
Refer to accounting principles of the consolidated financial statements and note 1.2 Operating income. A risk that the revenue is recognized in the wrong financial period (cut-off) is considered to be significant due to the size and nature of sales.

Overall group materiality EUR 3,6 million
How we determined it Net sales
Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied We chose net sales as the benchmark because, in our view, the performance of the Group is most commonly measured by using this criteria, and it is a generally accepted benchmark. We chose net sales as the benchmark as we considered that this provides us with a consistent year-on-year basis for determining materiality.
How we tailored our group audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
We have performed audit procedures in the most significant subsidiaries in Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden. We have considered that the remaining subsidiaries don't present a reasonable risk of material misstatement for consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most

Alma Media Group's revenue consists of content sales, advertising sales and service sales. For digital sales, content revenue is recognized over the contract period. For print publications, content revenue is recognized according to the publication calendar. The timing of revenue recognition from advertising sales is determined by the timing of the advertisement's publication. Service revenue is recognized in the period in which the service is delivered.
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER · We assessed the design effectiveness of key controls and tested the operating
effectiveness of controls relating to the cut-off of revenue recognition. · We considered the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition account-
ing policies. We tested by sample, that individual subscriptions and other contracts were recognized as revenue according to the Group's revenue recognition accounting policies. · In addition, we tested individual transactions, which occurred during the financial year.

GOVERNANCE

At 31 December 2017 the Group's goodwill balance amounted to EUR 121,7 million and intangible rights with indefinite lives EUR 35,1 million. Goodwill and intangible rights with indefinite lives are allocated to the cash-generating units.
The Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of goodwill.
The recoverable amounts are determined using value in use model. Value in use calculations are subject to significant management judgement in form of estimates of future cash flows, such as estimates of future advertising and content sales, and discount rates.
Valuation of goodwill and intangible rights with indefinite lives are a focus area in the audit due to the size of balance and the high level of management judgement involved.
Our audit focused on assessing the appropriateness of management's judgement and estimates used in the impairment analysis through the following procedures: · We tested the methodology applied in the value in use calculation by comparing
it to the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and we tested the mathematical accuracy of calculations; · We evaluated the process by which the future cash flow forecasts were drawn up, including comparing them to the budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board of Directors; · We assessed the reasonableness of cash flow forecasts by comparing the accuracy of prior period revenue growth and operating profit forecasts to actual outcomes. We also assessed the reasonableness of advertising and content sales growth rates used in the impairment calculations to our understanding of the business; · We considered whether the sensitivity analysis performed by the management around key assumptions of the cash flow forecast was appropriate by considering the likelihood of the movements of these key assumptions; and · T he discount rates applied within the model were assessed by PwC business valuation specialist. · We also considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures provided in note 2.1 in the financial statements.

Key audit matter in the audit of the parent company
VALUATION OF HOLDINGS IN GROUP COMPANIES
Refer to note 6.14 Investments.
At 31 December 2017 the holdings in group companies are valued at EUR 333,7 million. The holdings in group companies are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the book value of individual holding. The recoverable amounts are determined using value in use model.
Based on the annual impairment test of holdings in group companies management concluded that no impairment was needed. Valuation of holdings in group companies is a focus area in the audit due to the size of balance and the high level of management judgement involved.
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Our audit focused on assessing the appropriateness of management's judgement and estimates used in the impairment analysis through the following procedures: · We evaluated the process by which the future cash flow forecasts were drawn up,
including comparing them to the budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board of Directors; · We assessed the reasonableness of cash flow forecasts by comparing the accuracy of prior period revenue growth and operating profit forecasts to actual outcomes. We also assessed the reasonableness of advertising and content sales growth rates used in the impairment calculations to our understanding of the business; · We considered whether the sensitivity analysis performed by the management around key assumptions of the cash flow forecast was appropriate by considering the likelihood of the movements of these key assumptions; and · The discount rates applied within the model were assessed by PwC business valuation specialist.
There are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Alma Media Corporation's Board of Directors has approved Alma Media Group's Guidelines for Insiders on 21 September 2017. The Guidelines for Insiders are based on the Market Abuse Regulation, Level 2 Commission Regulations and the rules and guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and they supplement the valid provisions of NASDAQ Helsinki Ltd's Guidelines for Insiders, Chapter 51 of the Finnish Criminal Code, the Finnish Securities Markets Act and the regulations and guidelines issued by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority regarding the management and handling of insider information.

Internal Control
Internal control is an essential part of the company's governance and management systems, covering all of the Group's functions and organisational levels. The purpose of internal control is to provide sufficient certainty, for example, that the company will be able to execute its strategy. Internal control is not a separate process; instead, it is part of the company's operations, covering all Group-wide operational principles, guidelines and systems.
Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and the President and CEO carry the overall responsibility for organising the internal control and risk management systems for financial reporting. The President and CEO, members of the Group Executive Team and the heads of the business units are responsible for ensuring that the accounting and administration of the areas within their spheres of responsibility comply with legislation, the Group's operating principles and the guidelines and instructions issued by Alma Media Corporation's Board of Directors. In Alma Media Group, the control over business unit administration and accounting is centralised in the Group's financial administration. The financial department, working under the Group CFO, is the centralised source of financial statement data required by external accounting, as well as the analyses and result reports to Group and business unit management teams for following the profitability of business operations. Group internal control practices aim to ensure the correctness of financial reporting within the Group. Business operations and capital management are monitored with the help of the reporting measures outlined hereinabove. The reporting practices also assist in following the implementation of business unit action plans. The financial administration monitors and gives guidance regarding internal control measures and practices based on the Group's operating principles and guidelines.
Alma Media Group follows the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved for use within the European Union. Guidelines for financial reporting and accounting principles are collected in an accounting manual that is updated as standards change, as well as the financial department guidelines that are applied in

all Group companies. Group accounting is responsible for the following and observance of the financial reporting standards, maintaining financial reporting principles and communicating them to the business units.
Risk Management
Risk management is part of Alma Media's financial reporting process and one of the company's significant measures of internal control. At Alma Media Group, the task of risk management is to continuously evaluate and monitor all business opportunities, threats and risks to ensure the achievement of objectives and business continuity.

to meet this challenge by developing digital products and services for consumers and businesses.
Fluctuating economic cycles are reflected in the development of advertising sales. Advertising sales account for approximately half of the Group's revenue. Business operations outside Finland, such as in Eastern and Central European countries, include country-specific risks relating to market development and economic growth. The expansion of business outside Finland has reduced the risks inherent in operating in one market area.

The Board of Directors carries the primary responsibility for Alma Media's risk management. The Board of Directors considers the most significant identified risks and is in charge of defining the Group's risk appetite and risk tolerance. The Audit Committee prepares for the Board of Directors the risk management principles of the Group and monitors the efficiency of the risk management systems. The Audit Committee also discusses the management reports on significant risks and the company's exposure to them as well as considers the plans to minimise risks.

Disturbances of information technology and communications, cyber risks and the disruption of printing are the most important operational risks.

The CEO, the Group Executive Team and other managers in the Group at all organisational levels are responsible for daily risk management. In each business unit, a member of the unit's executive group, usually the person in charge of the finances, is responsible for risk management and reporting on risk management operations.

The risk management process identifies the risks, develops appropriate risk management methods and regularly reports on risk issues to the risk management organisation and the Board of Directors. Risk management is part of Alma Media's internal control and, thus, is part of good corporate governance. Alma Media sets limits to and procedures for quantitative as well as qualitative risks in writing in its risk management system. Alma Media classifies its business risks as strategic, operational and financing risks. The financing risks are described in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The most critical strategic risks for Alma Media are a significant drop in its print newspaper readership and a decrease in the online audience of digital media, a permanent decline in advertising sales and a significant increase in distribution and delivery costs. The group subscriptions of the major financial and technologyrelated magazines are significant in scale. Changes to the subscription agreements could have a substantial impact on the magazines' total subscription volumes. The media industry is undergoing changes following the transformation in media consumption and technological development. Alma Media's strategic objective is

Incentive Schemes
Share-Based Incentive Scheme (LTI 2015)
Scheme launched in 2015 In 2015, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation approved the establishment of a long-term share-based incentive scheme for the key management of Alma Media (hereinafter referred to as "LTI 2015"). The objective of LTI 2015 is to align the interests of the participants with those of Alma Media's shareholders by creating a long-term equity interest for the participants and, thus, to increase the company value in the long term as well as to drive performance culture, to retain participants and to offer them with competitive compensation for excellent performance in the company.
LTI 2015 consists of annually commencing individual plans, each subject to separate Board approval. Each of the individual plans consists of three main elements: an investment in Alma Media shares as a precondition for participation in the scheme, matching shares based on the above share investment and the possibility of earning performance-based matching shares.
The Matching Share Plan In the matching share plan, the participant receives a fixed amount of matching shares against an investment in Alma Media shares. In the first matching share plan, which commenced in 2015 (LTI 2015 I), the participant receives two matching shares for each invested share free of charge after a two-year vesting period, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the share-based incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.
The Performance Matching Plan The performance matching plan comprises a five-year performance period in total. The potential share rewards will be delivered in tranches after three and five years if the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained.
The performance measures used in the first performance matching plan, which commenced in 2015, are based on the company's profitable growth and share value. If the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are attained in full, the participant will receive in total four matching shares for each invested share free of charge, provided that the other conditions stipulated for the receipt of the sharebased incentive by the terms of the plan are still satisfied at the time.

Share-based incentive schemes started in 2016 and 2017: LTI 2015 II and LTI 2015 III On 17 March 2016, the Board of Directors of Alma Media Corporation decided on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2016 based on the LTI 2015 scheme (LTI 2015 II) and, on 22 March 2017, the Board made a corresponding decision on a share-based incentive scheme to be launched in 2017 (LTI 2015 III). The main terms of the incentive schemes correspond to those of the share-based incentive scheme that was launched in 2015.
The Board of Directors has estimated that no new shares will be issued in connection with LTI 2015. Therefore, the plan will have no dilutive effect on the number of the company's registered shares.
The Annual General Meeting of Alma Media Corporation held on 17 March 2016 authorised the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of a maximum of 824,000 shares in one or more lots, and further authorised the Board of Directors to decide on a share issue by transferring shares in possession of the company to implement incentive programmes.
